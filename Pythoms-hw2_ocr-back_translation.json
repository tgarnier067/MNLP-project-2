    "0": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tae is based is very general in the East. However, it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not take the form of prosents since the division that the Latin and Greek churches had; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a body of Lcltin could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually creed, and formed the object of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead who rose from their graves, and fed on the blood of young and beautiful tho. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, which were the helies, that part of the blood of their victims, which has become emaciated, lost their strength and quickly died of c0nomptions; while these human blood suckers have become fattened — and their veins have become distended to such a state of ropletion, as t0 cause the blood of all passages of their badges to flow, and even fr0m the ucry pores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Journal of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is declared for Hove accused in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the arid magistrates of the chief impoundment, they affirmed in a positive and unanimous way, that about five years earlier, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had blotted out to say, that, in Cassova, ori the brothers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of the euj1, by eating part of the earth of the epi of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from flouting a vampyre hesels; so, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complain of hauing 6th tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other troubles, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and did it freshly (as it is supposed to be in the cafes of uampyrism) and fully free of corruptionjon, and emit to rnuth, riosis, and ears, pure and fIorid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was entirely pushed by Arnold Paul's bear and body, where it is reported to haecreed cls terribly as it was olive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these people who had previously dictated varpyrism, for fear that they would in turn become undisputed by others who survived them.\nThe universe1 belief js, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, arid sucks in turn.\nChlef bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the presentations than any other resistance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece it is considered to be a kind of pvnishment after doatb, for some heinous crimes committed when it existed, that the deceased is not condemned to vampyria, but has opuled to limit the vjsitations bis infernal only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by bonds of friendship and effect. — An assumption mentioned in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corse shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of the natius, and suck it blo0d of all your race; there shall thy daughter, sister, and woman, smite, about midnight, drain the stream of life; yet the banquet that precedes shall feed thy livid living corse; thy victims, ore they still expire, Shail know the devil for the fire to be built; as thou cursedst them, thy flowers are wilted upon the stem. But he who falls for your crime, the youngest, the best loved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart in flaine! You must put an end to your task, and sit down at the last tint of his head, the last spark of his eyes, and the last glittery look seeth Who freozes o'er his life without life; then, with the unsaved hand will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock which Afficction bore the tenderest pledge was carried—but now is carried by the memorial of the lhine agony! And thy blood shall flow, thy grinning tooth, and thy gag; and thou shalt be in thy ravine, and thou shalt be gratified with gouls and Afrits, until the women of horror depart from them, more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey hcls was also introduced into his wild and heavtiful bul poem of \"Thalaba\", the vompyre corfe of the Arab handmaid Oneiza, who is represented as Hairig came back from the grave in order to torment hirn shc better loved during his existence. Bvt this cannot be assumed to the havc resulting from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tourncf0rt gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he claims to have been witness ari; and Calmet, iri his great work on this subject, besides damage of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating the effects of jts, has put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove that he is a classic, as well as barbaric errar.\nMany curious and intriguing opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; on the other hand, the present can be be begged for the limjts of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which are now conc1uded 6y simply notice, that although the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, thcre are scvercll other synonyms with it, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vroco1ocha, Vardou1acba, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, he appeared to the parte varioves and to the leaders of your anobleman, inorable for his singularities, with his runk. He looked at the miirm of the arourid, as if he could not participate in it. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous has drawn his attention, so that he can by one blow the hurdle, and casts fear into those breasts where it reigned carelessness. Those who felt this feeling of admiration, could nat cxplajn whencc he rose: a certain attrihuted itt0 the dead grey eye, which, staring upward at the face of the object, seemed to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the oheek with a ray of lead lhclt weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim t0 to be invited to every bou fè; all wanted to see it, and those who had been used to the excite violence, and now felt the weight af en nui, were happy to have something in their preserice able to engage their attende. In spite of the deadly tint of her foe, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or shook the strong emotion of passiori, despite its shape and its contours were beautiful, many fcmal hunters after the natoriity tried to gain her attention, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who was badly mocked by a monster of urery worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw the herse1f into her way, and did anything but put on a dress of a mantebank, to attract her step of ice:—although in vain:—when he stood before him, although his eyes were close fixed on her 's, he still seemed as if they were unperceived;—evcn his inapplauded iinconce wcls baffled, and she left the fiold. But although the adulterative comm0n cannot inflect everyi the guidance of his eyos, it is not that the female sex tbe was indifferent to him: however, such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent davghter woman, that few knew that Hecver was speaking to semeIos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and that it was that even sherried the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as hortery among the women who make up the boast of sex jr of their domestic virtues, as amang those who shove him by their vices.\nAhout the same time, there cclme in Lond0n a gentleman thyig by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by the parents who died when he was still Jn childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was only necessary to take care of the fortune, while they abandoned the more important charge of his mind lo tbe care of the suballerne mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this feeling of honor and high-romantic frankness, which destroys so many apprentices every day. He believed everything to sympathize with uirtue, and thought that the vico was thrown away by Providence simply for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted more in the vcsting of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, In sine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. It was beautiful, frarik, and rieh: for various reasons, when it enters gay circles, many mothers sneak into bim, striating what portrays the least truth their languishing or grotesque favourites: the daug-\nAt the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he was led into false notions of his tales and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram of solitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the tallow and wax cclndeles that sparkle, not from the presencc of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no finding in the life of recll for any of these congreries of pleasant images and tough descriptions in these volumes, of what he had formed his study. On the other hand, a little money in the vanity of gratified bis, it was absolute to rereadiqvishs his dreams, when the extraordinary bellg that we have above dcscrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and tbe vory impossibility of forming an idea of the carocler af a man completely absorbed in himself, wh0 gaues few other signs of obserty of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by avoiding the contact tbeir: allowing his irnagination t0 image every time the propensity to the extravagance of ideas, he soon formed this object to the berg0 of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the persori assimilate it. He became acqv aint with him, paid him atteritions, and if sar has advanced in his opinion, that his presenco has been rehearsed alwoys. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's quarters were embarrasods, and he soon found, from the notes of the preparatlon on the street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain some informal respeeling this Sirigular character, which, until now, had directly struck his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, it was time for him to execute the taur, which for many rites was tbougbl necessary for enoble lbe yaung to take a few quick steps in the career of uice towards putti nd themselves on an equality with the ogés, and not to allow them to appear as if flalleri froin the sky, when never scaridalovs intrigues are chinned as subjects of the acceptable or pralse, accordlrig to the degree of competence they have had in the realization of the latter. They consented: and Avbrey immediately evoking the Bi intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fla...\nHe accepted it with joy, and in a few days they passed through the water.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and n0w il fovnd, that, although much more bis actians had been exposed to his life, the results offered different conclusions of apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, reappeared from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not avoid making remarks, for it was not on the virtuous and reddish iridence of the companion, even on the virtuoso, that he lowered his cllms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely removed; 6and when he proclinated to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him lo wallow in lust hjs, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This wos, howover, attributed by him to the greatest importunity of vicious tho, which usually prevails over the retirement of the virulent indigents. There were ono circumstances about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more lmpresfed up0 in his mind: any lhose upon which it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse vpon it, for they were all led to the sea, or sunk at the lowest and the most abjcct mjsery. In Brussels and through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizcd to the apparent impatience of whieh his companion sought the entrances of all vicc in fashion; there he entered into the jnto allthc spirit at the table of faro: he bet, and played always successfully, exoperated where the best known was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more thari than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, if he met the eruption young novice, or did it without chance of a nunnery family; then his very will paid the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the wcls Iaid spirit, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the f-dead hal mouse. In each city, he left the youth formerly trifle, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sat that had drawn him into the reaeh os this fiend; wbilst much a father sitting fraritic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, or with even buying enough for fcltisfy there present envy. But ho did not take money from the table of play; bvt immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the conuulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was rioting, however, capable of ooinbatirig tbe eunning of the ex-\n- Yeah, that's right. Aubrey often wanted to represent Tbjs to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of Al, and did not fear himself for his own benefit; — but he delayed him — for every day he gave him the opportunity to speak to him openly and openly; however, tbis never happened. The Lord Ruthuen in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: his eye spoke less than his lip; and the gypsy Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification of it than the constant excitement of wanting to break the tbat rnysteria, which t0 his exalted imagination bcgan to assume the appearance of something punctual.\nThey arrived on Romc, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room on the morning circus of an Italian countess, as he set out to search for the memorials of another almost deserted cily. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he impatiently worked; the first woes of his sister, breathing not pashirig but affection; the others were of his gvardians, the latter surprised him; if he had brought into his imagination that the threshing was an evil power residing in his companion, they began to waste sufficient reason for belief. His guards jnsisted on his immediate departure from his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been denied, that his contempt for the insult had not been generated by the hatred of the hercharacter; but he had asked, to revive his gratification, that his vjclim, the partner of his guilt, shovld be driven out of the pincle of virtue vnsullicd, dowri at the lowest abyss of infamy and endowment: in the end, tal all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, hod, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey disbanded by leaving one, of which cbclracter had not yet shown a luminous point sjngle on which t0 remains tbe eye. He refused to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, in order, in the sense, to do so more closely, so as not to allow light circles to pass without being warned of them. He entered the same circle, and soon percoive, that his seigneury was bereaved to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is Seldam that an unmarried woman is met in the house; he was obliged to land on her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye littered with him in all his similif, and soon disavowing that an asflgnatlon had been appointed, whlch would probably spoil an innocent, though unimaginable girl. He did not waste time seizing Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked Hiin to respect the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet his thalter night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his indentions were such that he would have had on such an occasion; and after pressing wbether he intended to marry him, simply riscd. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram at that time he must declare to accompanyjnghis L0rdship in the rest of the projected tbeir, he commissioned his servarit to search for other apartments, and called the lady's tho rnother, the infinite of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven merely told his scout that he had fully consented to a separation; but he did not imply that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nFearing that Rome, Aubrey, would take his steps towards Greece, and cross the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housque of a Greek; and soon he took care to trace the faded traces of glory ancestralized on monuments which, apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freedom only before the slaues, had often hidden them under the sheltering ground or many lichen hearts. Under the same roof as the swallow, expulsed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have bewitched the model of a pclinter wanting to pour on the carivass tbe promised ditful osthe hope in Mohammed's parcldis, savo that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that it could be thought to belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plajn, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of hcr bercles; for whom would exchangcd hcroeil, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxury look asleep of the animaI adapted but to the taste of an epic. Tbe light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, show all the beauty of his form, sloatirig as he was on the wind, to thc gasc avid of him, who forgot the letters that he had jvst decypbcred upori an almosa spelled talet, in the contemplation of his sylpha-Iike figure. Oflen wanted his false braids, as she flattered around, to expose in the ray of the s such a brilliant tely delica and quickly erase the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antjquarian, who lev escapes from his mirid the object that he had before thaughl of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and astonishment balls. As he drew the remains which he wanted to preseruo a memorjaI during the next few hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance on the open plain, painted to him in all the brilliant colors af youthsul memory, the marriage pump that she remanifested viewing in her irony; and then, turning to sub-jocts that had evidently madc a greater impression on her mjnd, told him all the superriatural talcs of her nurse. His gains and his apparent belief in what she narrated, even aroused Aubrey's interest; and often as she told him the story of the living Uampyre, which he had spent years in the midst of his frucndes, and the most expensive, forced each year, feeding on a beautiful semalc to prolong his existence for the months that followed, his blood would run cold, while trying to laugh at so much id1e and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted him the riames os oldrnen, who had at last detected one living between them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found them so unbelievable, she begged him to flout it, if he had been noticed, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had evidence that dazzled them, with grief and sorrow, to convince her. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and hjs horror was increased, haunting a fairly precise description of Lord Rulhven; he, hawevcr, still persisted in persuading her, that thore could 6th na truth in his fears, although at the same shot he won to the mary coricidencos who had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthuen's supernatural tho power.\nAubrey began to cling more to Ianthe; his innocent, so contrasted with all the virtues of the women among whom he had soovght f0r bis visiori of romance, gained his heart; and that he ridiculed the idca of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, still found hiinself m0re and more ottachod to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself from the ottimes fr0m it, and, forming a plan for the resecration of antiquarians, he set out, determined not to return until his object wos reached; but he was always able to keep his attention to the rvins upwards around him, and in his mind he retained an irnogue which seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his tboughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and always was the same insantile frankness being that he had known the first time. She always seemed pclrt of him witb roluclarice; but it was necessary she had rio rio more than someone with whom sbe could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some sragmenl that bad yet escape from the destructive hand of time. Shc had appeared to your parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with sevcr al prefent, affirmed their existence, pole with horror in the name itself. Soori afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which was to hold him sor for a few hours; when they bearded the name of the place, all at the same time, that he be obliged not to return to the night, as he should not pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, aster the poorly closed day, vpon any consideration. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey rnade the light of their representations, and tried to get them out of the idea; bul when he saw them trembling at his darjng so to mock a superiar, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he wos silent.\nThen Aubrey set out unattendedly; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of the Bi host, and worried about sinning his words, mocking the bolief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with an unfortunate terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and shook him fervently for the return, and by the night passed the power of these boirigs was put into action; he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive tbat-doy-lumer would soon be ond, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the glass cllamates, so fast to gather in a huge mass, and paur ail their rage on the devoted land.—He finally arched, mounted his horse, determined to mako by the speed for his delay: hut he waf too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediately, the sun sets, the night begins: and it had advanced far, the power of the wclf star above—the thunders failing had barely a resting interval—its heavy rain forced its way through the leafago of the canopy, while the blue lightning f0rked seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse snuffed Srighl, and he was carried with terrible speed to the entangled forest. The animal finally, by fatigue, stopped, set in motion, 6y the dazzling of lightning, that it was iri the vicinity of a bowl that hardly rose from the masses of dead lcaves and brush that surrounded it. Move, he approaches, hoping to find one to guide him to t0wn, or confident lcast to get the storm enclave. As he approached, the lunders, for a moment silenl, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation, exulting or a laugh, contjnued iri a sound almost intact;—he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door or the cabin to operate. He threw it into total darkness: the sound, h0wever, guided it. He was apparently vnpered; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no note was taken of the bim. He found himself in the tacl with someone whom he seized jmmediately; when a uoice cried out: \"Again mocked!\" t0 that a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt eaten by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life very dearly, he read; but he fought in vain; he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his beak, had put his hands bis on his thraat—when the brilliance of mony torches penetrated into the hole thclt illuminating the day, disturbed him; — he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in clmomenl the crasbirig of the branches, as he broke the wood, was heard rio longer. The agenda of the meeting was now clear; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by these wilpouts. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the valleys of the mvd, and the stubble loaded on each straw with large soot straws. To Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was again left in the darkness; bvt what horror his horror, when the highl of the torches of Tbe burst once out of mare on hiin, to perceive the aerial form of beautiful hls conductor brught in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was an arisirig visjon of the disturbed imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but it was a silence lowering his foe which seemed almost as boring as the life that once lived there: – on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: – At that men pointed, wept, struck with horror, \"A vampire! A vampire!\" A lilter formed quickly, and Au6rey got tired alongside her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now falling with the flower of life that had dragged in her. He did not know who his thoughts were — his mirid was eaten up and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held unconsciously almast in his hand a bare dagger of a particular constrvction, which had been found in the hut. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for ber wham a mother had misod. Their lamcntable cries, cls they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible cotastrophe. \"To describe their fault would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to Corsica.\" They were inconsolable; bobb died in the heart of br0ken.\nAubrey being pvt in bed was seized with the most folding fever, and was often delirjovs; in these intervals it would be ea1l upori Lord Ruthvcn and on Ianthe — why an inexplicable combination it seemed the men of his former complnion for sparo loved hc. At other times, he impregnated the maldictions on his head, and cursed him as his destrayer. L0th Rutbven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of Hlm, whose image he now had in common with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his words, was very repentant in his words for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. He seemed to have changed his seniority; he appeared only the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his evalesceress began to rush, he gradually withdrew to the same state of mirid, and Aubrey did not see any difference compared to the old man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on the back, with a smi1e of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smilo hau-\nThat's him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to swallow up the tideless waves raised by the cold breozo, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the still fun;—lnded, he seemed to want av0id tbe eyef of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrcy, by this sbock, was much defiled, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but as long as he wanted him for solitude, his mind could not find him in the TB of At hens; if he looked for him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, Ianthe's shape stood by his side – if he were looking for him in the TB wood, his slight step seemed to be wandering around amputating the undergrowth, the quest for purple m0dest; then turned abruptly ravnd, showing, with wild imagination, his pale and wounded face lhroat, with a gentle smile vpon his lips. Ho determined to steal scenes, all the characteristics of which cracked these bitter associations in the hif spirit. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he bound himself the tender cler whom he had taken from him during his illness, to visit the parts of Greecc neilher still seen. They went in all directions, and sought every place to remember and to remember what they were looking at; but thus they seized from one place to another, but they did not take into account what they were looking at. Tbcy heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually implored to lighten the lasc's reports, which they were trying to invent only individuals, who were interested in exciteing the generosil of those they were defending against alleged dangers. As a result, the council of the inhabitants, on occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tornado, wilh large masses of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their head, and by the cchoed ratio of the sevcral cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placirig themselves behind the rocks, had weapons to fire in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, withdrew for a moment, in spite of the sheltering of the defilement: but shameful to be so detained by an enemy, who, with insulting blows, advanced them, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thugs were to climb above and take lhom to the rear, they immediately discouraged the rushing of the enemy's search. They had hardly raised the shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to a grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer attentive to the side or to his own peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — bis guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, impenetibly thrown his arms and over-endormated.\nBy promises of hail, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded frindon to a nearby hut; arid having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence – they simply kept the energence until their comrade came back with the sum given, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthuen quickly became disordered; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to be advancing with hasty steps. His coricul and his appetite had not chongred; he sowed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the obsessed of him; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who was led to offer his asfistanoe with mare that the fervor of usucll – \"Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I watch out for the death of my exjsence as lilty as that of the day of the Passirig; but you can save my honor, your friend'shanour. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I'd do any thirig, Aubrey.—\"I need little bul — my life quickly panics—I don't explain everything—but if you hid everything you know ine, rny honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world—and if my death did not take place for some time in England—I—but life. \"-\"We don't know him. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up violently, \"Swear by all your soul that by all your nature you swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any calamity, no matter what happens, or whatever you can see. \"If eyes fainted from their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing on his pillow, arid no longer breathed.\nA Ubrey withdrew to rest, but did not stop; the many circumstances that were present at his ascendant with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered a cold chill, he came from him, as if he were coming from the present of something horrific that awaited him. The ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri that he hcld left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was not 1ongcr there, having been cnveyed by himself orid comrades, at the moment he was retiring, the pinaole of a nearby mountain, according to a promif that they hcld gave his seigneury, tal he should expose to the first cold ray of tho moon that the rose of his declth. Aubrey had the climax, and took several men, decided to go and cook it on where it is. But there is no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the robbers swore to indicate the identicol rock on which they put the bhdy. For some time his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that TBey had buried the corpse for the sake of the cl0lhes.\nWeary of a stream in which he had encountered such terrible mjsfortunes, and iri that all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resisted to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or to Naples, he oceuped his sons by arranging the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been one case containing several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While returning and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at fjnding a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal hvt — he trembled — rushing to get the stealthy proof, he found tho weapon, and his borror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, though pocuiarly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; yct stilI, he wanted to disbelieve; but the particular shape, the same shades variable on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and did not leave room for the owt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his fjrst investigations were about the lady he had tried to capture Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. His parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and the sbe had not been heard since Ibe départementuro of his seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated borbors; he feared that this lady had fallen a victim to Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed to be abiding at his will, soon gallothed him on the English coast; and hc welcomed to the mansiori of his fatbers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, the sbe was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had a riot that winnlng grclce wbich wins the gaze and applause of tbe drawlng-room assembled. There was no light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His oye blvd was never lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm ab0ut it that did not seem to arise from the misfortune, bvl of some sentimentirig inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was rioting that light soot, which misleads when'er a butterfly color oua can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When Alorie, her face was never illuminated by Jay's smile, but when her bream\nAnd in her presence, would she forget the sorrows she knew had caused at her rest, who would have exchanged her flow for that of the eluptvary? It seems flexible as if these eyes—this face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, he had been thought by his guardians more appropriate than his preseitation should 6th delay the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be protector. It was now that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, had to be the time of the ber's entry into the \"abuse scene.\" Aubrey preferred to bring back to his father's private hotel, and he had had enough of the ineIancboly who surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the coldest of the most fashionable, when the bis spirit had been so hot by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to his sister's protection joon. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd of Tbe was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and al1 who was uncomfortable to rest in the mile of royally, hastened to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner, without being conned, he remembered that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that plain, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his eternity, \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a spectre that would blow up the hjm, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his attention or this place when he first entered the si cicty. He went away until the limbs almost looked like carrying their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and in anticipation of a passage through the crowd, he threw himself irito his car, and wos led to the house. Hc passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on the bis's head, for he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again in front of him—star circumstances—\n— He woke him up, he could believe it was possible — death has risen in the past! — He thought his imagination had conjured the image if Mirid was rested.\nMove in. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for if he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hurig von his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there stood back up his own devouring thovghts. As they departed, many people woke up and entered another room, and found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a real canversalion; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one of them asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those features which he abhorred most. And he went forth, and took hold of the arm of his sjster, and, with a hasty step, gave him up to the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to pass over them, be again heard that voico murmured unto him: \"Remember thy oalh!\" — He did not turn, but sent his sister, soori came to him.\nAu6rey has become very distracted. So much so that his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of inonster 1iving has again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed her to explain to her what had caused her sudden conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His aath surprised him;—did he allow this monster to wander, to ruin the breath of it, to destroy all that he held dear, and not to rule out his progress? His sister was stained by HLM. But if we were to break his oath, and reveal bif suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the fram world such a wretched; but death, he remembered, had already been crippled. For days, ho remained in this state; locked in his room,hc did not eat and did not eat until his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, being no longer able to bear the still1ness and loneliness, he left his house, with a streot to stroet, anxious to steal this haunted image of hiin. His dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight humidity. He was not dropped at the 6th recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his saferie, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislodged by him who fled from a swister pursuer than any thought. His conduct, however, weldly loaded. Struggled with the thal ho idea left behind by his entire tho absence of his friends, with a fiend among them, whose TBey presence was unconscious, he decided to cnter agoin in society, and watcb bim clasely, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, the glances of haggard and suspicion were so intriguing, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg of him for abstclin to seek, for her, the society that offended HLM so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved vnavailing, the guards thought it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that Aubrey's parents had imposed on them before.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered during his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what was considered madness, they engaged the aphysicist to reside at iri tbe and take care of him. He seemed to notice it, if completely was the bis spirit absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherent bee at the tip so big, that it was confined to his room. He is often lying there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his cyes had reached a vitreous chandelier; — the only sign of afsecin and memory remaining appeared on his sister's training; then hc would begin something, and, shaking his hands, with the thal appearances seriously distressed, he would make her pass so as not to touch the hive. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your loot is for me, fuck him!\" Wben, however, she asked whom he referred to, her only answer was: \"True! True!\" And once again he sank Jnto a state, wbence riots even she could wake him up. However, little by little, as the eyeclr passed, his incoherenes became less frequent, and his mind mingled with a part of his morosity, while his guardians observed, tal severcll t imes the day he counted on his fingers a certain numberer, and tben smile.\nThe lime had almost fainted, when, at the top of the year, one of his guardians had started to talk to his doctor about the melancholy situation of Avbrcy in such awfu1 situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was instantly drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, of whlch tbey feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expression bis iritontiori to be presenl to the nuptials, and eager to see his sist er. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his fisher was with him. He was apparently again able to be asphyxiated by the influence of his pretty girlfriend; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed his cheek, wot with tears, freaking out at the thought of his brioche once again alive to linger on feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his arid fulfillment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, what was his surprise to contemplate the features of the monster who had so long infunished his life. He captured the portrait of a paroxysm of rage, and trampled under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand it, then took hold of his hands, arid looking at her with a serious expression of the spirit, he swore that ghtshc would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that if tbat voice again sade hirn remembered his oath—he suddenly turned, thinking that Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the physicjan, who had heard the whole, and thought that this wcls but a return of his disorder,\nAnd the enchanting Miss Aub Rey, he wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, he begged, he begged them to die, but for one day. They, attrjbvting this to the insanjty they imagined had taken possession of the spirit of hls, adeovaured to pocify it, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the living room, and he refused with all the others. What did he hear about Aubrey's disease, that he understood himself as the cause of this disease, but that he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had won this information. Ho hastened to go to the house of his former companion, and, by the hard presence, and the great pretension of the bone for the brother and the interest in his falsity, he graduated1ly wori the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His T0ngue had dangers and toils to retract—could speak of him1f as an individual having no sympathy with any being ori the overcrowded earth, unless he saw her to whom he addressed;—could say how, since he knew, his exile, had begun to see worthy of conservation, if he were only tbat he could listen to your aocents asothirig;—in the end, he knew whether woll how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, tbat ho won his affiliations. The title of the eldest 6ranch fell to him in length, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in fear of his brother's disturbed state,) wbich had to take place the day before the departure of hls for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was lefl by the doctor and his guards, amputated lo bribo the servclnts, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, accompanying her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own boor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for the birds that graze, on which hc den0unce the heavy curses of the moss. The servants promised that they would untie him; bul give him to the physicist, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the busy bones nates preparation. The morning came, and the noise of pickles broke on his ear. Aubrcy grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, thy graduation slole away, leaving the hive in the custody of an old defenseless womani. He seized the supply, and one of them was out of the room, and in a rnoment he found himself in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm hy force, rushed hlm from the ro0m, speechless with fury. When he was on the Stock, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6th day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his ants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to pick him up. Aubrey could not bear him himself; his wind of fury had broken a blood vessel, and he was in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he got away, as the doctor is afraid of agitatirig. The marriage was dissolved, and the bride married left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; 0f of blood shed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted the guards of his sisler to be able to call, and when midnight had struck, he reported what the reader had lost — he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but they arrived, it was too much to eat. Lord Ruthven had spoken, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the hair of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"Tbe world was before him, where to ruin his resting place, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 18I2, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certcliri cattle and vegetables still at 6th had there, led many British ships to visit — both men of war and merchontmen; and it is rather out of the water for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the violation of a voyage. We landed, like usua1, at the bolt of the bay, and while the men were employed to water, and the shipowner negotiated for the cattle with the nativos, the ecclesiastical and the myse1f at 0k a ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we had the spirit of a young Greek as a guide ovr, who told us that he came from Scio with an English lord, wbo for fear that the days bitter islarid before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me like a pjlot,\" said Tbe Grec, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose a qvit Mililene, where I am likely to marry. He was anodized, but he was a good man. The house above the hill1, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he left an old mcln in cbclrge of him: ho gave Dominick, the merchant of wlne, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and sold there about fourteen months, but not constant1y; for he will say in his felucca very 0ften to the difference is1ands.\"\nThis account exalted our very mulled claries, and we did not waste any time hastening at the house that our peasant had resjded. We were graciously received by an old man who led us to the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a ensiling parlovr, and a 6ed room, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green-coloured walls, rallies tablacs on the ejther side, a large bluertle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed source in the tbe side of a small Bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the surniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane armchairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, rior only one painting. The bedroom had only one largo mattress extending the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. We blocked a marble niche, once the old man told us, chained with books and papers, which were then in the chest of a sailor of hell jn the near: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contrants. Ori the tablet of recreation poses Voltaire's, Shakespeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the language of Germari; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mllton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed in Parma in 1810; severa1 small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinoplc, much torn, hut no English books of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin ond. The Messiah was lilerally scribed everywhere, and marked wilh briefs of paper, on whioh alsa were remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, he must lie there until his return; for he is so special, that if I renounced a thing without order, he would frown on Rne for a week together; hcis and erways very good. I have done him a service, and I have the product of the tbis farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay t0 an elderly Arnenian who rcslides in cl small house in the wood, and which the lord brought bero d'Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was foldjng. The portico ln frorit was in bad steps Iong and fourteen wide, and the canned marble pillars witb 6lack pljnths and nice cargo-work work horns (as it is now the usual architecture jn Greek,) were confidentially grower lhan le roos. The roof, surrounded by a clear balustrade, was covered with a fine Tvrkey earpiece, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most housc-tops are furnished, af on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we buried the house, a stream of srall slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back, on which we were told, the lord spent mary from his evenings until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" exclaimed the old man, \"praying\" because he was very devoted...\nut, \"and always attended our churcb twice a week, besjdes Sundays.\"\nThe view fr0m this wcls seat what can be called \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, and to the top of it, of which an ancient Greek dull appeared in the majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, untjl il wos losl iri the base of the dead noarthe wads. The sea smooth as g1ass, and a colourless horizon with a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a lilte on the left, near a view of the Ohsnut and the lofty palm trees, several small islands unctuously observed, studddjng light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a vjew more tban I djd that; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Tbe Arminari,\" said ovr c0nductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't,\"—\"And can't you say it, old friend?\" I said— \"If I'm an asshole,\" he says, \"I don't dare.\" We did not take a shot to vlsit the Armenian, 6ut on ovr back in the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. Ho hod shared eight young girls when he was last vpon tbe lsland, and baked with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. Ho also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave GreekTestamonts to tho paor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we co-elected, to have been a very ecoenterical and caring character. We learned the circumstances, which our old friend at the otlage considered appropriate not to dissociate. He had a very beautiful daugbter, with which the lard was often seen walking on the seafront, and he bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we left the pious island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on tbe rack, guessjng that this rambler iri Greece cavld being. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and moreover those ecclesialities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our entire dovhtf was dissipated. FaIlingin Compones with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" he said, \"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byrori; I greet him in my travels on the Ifland of Tenedos, arid I also visited the hive in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordsbip, as we have been bad a few years home fram; but \"Chi1de Harolde\" being put in our heels we recognized the reclus of Calcla in the excessive page. We deeply regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we corisolcid nosselvef with the idea of returning t0 Mitylene a future day; but to me that day never resumes. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good riam of her lordsbip, who was grossly slandered. It has been dcscribcd as an insensitive dlsposition, avcrse to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its foreheads, or to add lo jts pmeasures. Tbe made is directly tho inverse, bone can be collected plalily from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, his elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark hjm cls a being on the heart of quisc Reljgion bath has put his seal, and on the head of which Benev0lence has cast his inontle. No man can take the previous \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as an emissary. With regard to his love or plea, I do not assume the right to give an oplnion. Reports are never received with caut--\nion, pcltricularly when directed against the moral integrity of man; arid be wbo ose justify bimself beforc that the horrible court where all must appear, clone can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Making a good secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "1": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE Simpertition on which his tale is based is general in the East. Among the Arahians he seems to be emmon: he did not, hawever, extend his sons to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he took his present form only since the division of Latin and Grekchurches; to which timc, the idea of becoming dominant, the thal a Lalin body could not drink so drunk in their tcrjtory, he gradually irritated, and formed the subject of wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their gravins, and feeding on the blood of the young and bcautiful. In the Wesl, it sprecld, with some slight variations, garlic on Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres night soaked some of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strenglh, and quickly died of consumption; while these hum a fattened blood sucker — and their bcoam veins distend the state of repletion, cls to cause the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even pores from their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hurigary. It seems that on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, the latter confronted each other in a urianimous manner, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard that, in Cassavia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of himself, eating part of the land of the vampy grove and rubbing himself with his blood. However, this measure did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being massacred by him, and a deposit was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other malices, the inhabitants built their Hadagni, took the body of Tbe, and found (as it is supposed to be usual in case of vampyrianism) fresh, and completely free of corruptian, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fiorid blood. Having thus been obtained, This is a problem that is currently facing us. A wcls stake leads entirely through Arnold Pavl's heart and body, where he would have dared ovt as terribly as if he had been aljve. This dono cut his head off, burned his body, arid threw ashes into his grave. The samc mocles were adopted with the corses of the Persians who had died before of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belif is, that a person sucked by a vampyr becomes himself a vompyre, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of Ballistics.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is linked here, because it seems better suited to j1lustrate the sub-ject of the present ohservations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to limit his infernal uitatjons only to the beings he loved to inoster on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, as Vampyre did, thy horn shall be torn from her back; then aunt the natius piece, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence thy daughter, sister, wifo, about midnight drain the stream of life; Turn off the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid, thy victims, ore they still expire, Shalje know the devil for their sire; as ye cursed them, thy flowers are wilted upon the stem of TBA. Bul a thal for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best beloved of all, Shail bless you with the name of a father — This word sholl envelops your heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the 1st tint of His cheek – the last spark of his eye, And the last glanoe glassy must see Who releases 2 is his lifeless blue; Thon with the tear without bean The lresses of his yellow hair, Os which, in the lift a lock when the most expensive money of Afficejon was worn—But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! But with your best blood, your grinning tooth,\nthen ftalklng to your full gravo, Go – and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who harror get away from the more cursed spectrum than tbey.\nMr. Southey bos also presented in his wi1d but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arabic Orieiza, who was represented as having returned from the grave in order to torture him that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to have caused the sin of her life, since she is povtrayed throughout the lale bone a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of amazing cases af vampyrifm, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmodot, in hif great work vpon this subject, ignores a variety of anecdotes, and the traditional narrators have given examples of his effects, low put forth s0me dissertalists loarned, harassing to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about its superstiti0n migbt will be added; even if the present may suffice to the limits of a no te, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can now be concluded by merely pointing out, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several otbers synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations otlenting upori a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parts of the shields of the ton, more remarkable for its singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirlh around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the branch attracted only its atlent, so that it could by a l0okqvell, and cast fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt the feeling of apprehension could not explain where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring at the obitect's sace, did not sow to penetrate, and to the eye of the anne to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of leaderi thclt weighed on the skin that he should not pass. All wanted to see him, and those who had been called upon to violate the excitement, and now the weight of boredom, were raining to have somcthing in their presence capaI to engage their attention. Despite the sweet shade oshis faco, which has never gained a warmer shade, either from the modesty of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, many female hunters have tried to gain its attachments, and to win, at least, the same darkness of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of any monster sewn in the drawing-r0oms since her marriage, has thrown himself in her way, and has done anything but put ori lbe robe af a monthebank, to stir up her opinion:—bough jn vain:—when she stood before him, it seemed that her eyes were fixed on her, but it seemed that they were not understood;—even her unapplied impudence was basfled, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not irfluence even the guidance of his eyes, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: yet this was the cautian appearance with whieh he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, whom few ever knew hc addressed to women. He had, rainbow, the reputation of a winning language; and, let it be euon ouercame the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vigo, he was also often among the thofian women who formed the van of lhoirex of their domestic virtues, like Arnong thase who shook him by their vices.\nAb0ut the same time, there came your Londan a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great wooltb, by parents who died while ho was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his f0rtune, while thoy abandoned his imporant rnore charge of his mind to the custody of merconarian subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian tban his judgment. He had, bence, thal high romantic feeling of good and candour, which every day run so many learnings of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was incrusted by Providence simply for the piclorosque effect of the scene, as we see it in romances: he bought thot the misery of an inerly coniferous cottage in vestibular clots, whicb were also hot, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and patches of variof color. In the end, he learned that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when entering gay circles, the mclny motters surrounded him, trying to deseriboer with the least truth their languissirig or grumpy favorites: the girls at the same time, by their tight faces which he bent, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the rostrum of the hours solitary bis, he was surprised at findiririg, that, except in the high 0w and wax candles that sniffed, not of the presence of a ghost, but of lack of sriufflng, there was no findatien in true 1jfe for any of the congreries of tbat of pleasant pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, of whlch ho had formed his glow. By finding, however, some compensation in his grotifjed vanity, he is about to re-readifh his dreams, what is the extraordinary being we described above, crossed him jn his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of an idea0f the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who had as many signs of his obfervation of oxternal objccts, as the tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatjon to cut off all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the thls objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and decided to observe the offsprjrig 0f hjs fantasy, rather than the person before him. He met with him, paid attention to him, and so far advclric on his opinion, that his presonic has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and he soon found, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was at six o'clock to travel. Desirous of obtaining information on this singular character, which, now, had struck his curiosity, he hined t0 his guards, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been necessary to enoble the y0ung to take a few quick steps in the career of vice to put on an eqvality with the elderly, and not allow them to appear as if fa1len from the sky, whenever soandal intrigues are mentioned as subjects af pleasantry or praise, accordirig t0 the degree o the competence of shewri to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his interitioris to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently had no hlng iri common with other men, he willingly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHthorto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, although many of his cliquetis were exposed to his point of view, the results offer conclusionians different from the reasons apparent to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality;—the idle wanderer, arid the beggar, received from his hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not begin to point out that he was not vp0n the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the dishonest assistants, even on virtve, that he gave his olms; - these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligclte came to ask for something, not to relieve his guards, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. It was, commenting, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, wblch generally preuai1s on the retirement of the virtuous indiggent. There was a circle around the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: grip those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because TBey were all led to lhescaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the m0st abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubr ey was svprizod to the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centers of all the Fashionabe vice; he entered into the spirit at the Fara table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known was his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he won; but it was always the face without change, with which he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, Thus, when he encountered the Yovthful n0vice eruption, or the unlucky father of a large family; then his very desire seemed very well the law of — this apparent abstraction of the mind was removed, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the cat's thcll while delirling with the dead mouse haIf. In the city of Cvery, he left the youth formerly flocked, torn from the circle he adorned, cvsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falsity that had attracted him to the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the dreadful eyes of children hungry for mule, without a single farthing of his immense latc wealth, where to buy enough bishop to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately I0st, to the ruining tho of many, the last dorlot that he had just pulled himself out of the convulsive catch of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, the struggle against the most experienced cunririg. Aubrey often wanted to deny this to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleclusure that ravaged the ruin of AlI, and did not tend to make bisown profits;—but he did—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frantically and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthvenin his car, in the middle of the varia...\nous wild andrich scencs of nature, has always been the same: his eye is flattered less than his lip; and tbaugh Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he has obtained no gratification grafting from it that the confit excite os vainly want to break this mystery, which at hjs exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost the sight of his companion; either left hjm in the daily ottendononce on the morning circle of a Countess of Italjan, he wept in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters secured from England, which he opened wilh eagor impatient; the first was to his sisler, breathing nothing but the faction; the others were frustrated his guards, the latter astonished hjm; jf it had been necessary in his imaginatiori that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him a sufficient reason for tho helief. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend and urged him to attack his character in an ulcerative manner, as the possession of irresistible poachers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that his conternpt for adultery had not generated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had demanded, to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the portion of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of unwelded virtue, down from the abyss af infclmy and degradation: in the end, that all the fo males whom he sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the moss aside, ond had not scrupulously to expose the deformity of their vices to public folly.\nAubrey determined on the lectving one, whose cabarotter had not yet shown a single point brjght ori that rested the eye. He tried again to invent a pretext of plavsib1e to abandon him altogetber, to seek, in some time, to monitor him more closely, and not to leave light circumstances unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshlp was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with iri basety; so he was obliged to take care of her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye dazzled her in all her wlndings, and soon discussed that an assignment had been designated, which would probably have arisen in the ruin of an innocent and thoughtless girl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's applause, and suddenly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6elng about to meet hcr tbat the same night. Lard Ruthveri became weaker, and his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an accasiori; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply lavghed. Aubrey withdrew; he immediately wrote a note, to say, tbat from that time, he must dcclirie accompanying his Lordfhip in the rest of the proposed visit to tbeir, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and appeal to the mother of the lady, informed her all bones to be known, not only to his daughter, but also onerning the character of his Lordship. The Assig Nation has been proven. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his handmaid to warn his full assertion to a solation; but did not mention any suspicion of his havlng beon plans thwarted by Aubrey's iriterpositlon.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the periinsula, soon found himself in Atbens. He then fixed the residence of hjs in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to draw up the records erased of clincific glory upori monuments which apparently, shameful to time the acts of free men anly before the splashes, were hidden under the floor sheltering lichen color. Under the same roof as Helf, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to spread on the cariva ss he promised the hope of the faithful in Mohammed's period, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that he might belong to those who do not make mistakes. As she danced on the side of the mountain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it was said that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for a drowsy luxury look of the adapted animcll but to the taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the poisonous young girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, showed the beauty that1c of his form, flocking as he was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylpha figure. Often, his braids would fall, as sbe flitted arourid, expose in the ray of the sun svch delicately bright and fast1y fading hves, jt might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the object very stand before thinking of vita1 importclnco to the good interpretation oss a passeclge inPausanias. But why try to descrlbe charms feel everything, but no cari appreciates it?—It was jnnocence, youth, and 6eauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and galvanized the magic effect of the bis pencil, tracing the scencs of her native p1ace; shc would then describe to him the entourage of the open plain, would be pale, to him in all the luminous c0lors of turbulent memory, the marriage pump that she reformulated when seeing iri his childhood; and theri, turning to the subjects tbat had evidenly made a greater impression on the mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of his nvre. Her fervour and her apparent conviction of what she told, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a loving woman to spread her existence during the months that followed, her blood ran oold, wbilst he tried to get her out of so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the nclms of old men, who had at last detected a connection among them, after several of their close relatives and children had found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for he had been, noticed, tal those who had not dared to question their existence, had always had a proof that required him to confess, with pain and tear. She gave him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise desorption of the Lord Rulhuen; however, he persuaded her again by persuading her, that there would be rio truth in her fears, tovgh at the same time marveled at many coincidences that all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach him more and mare to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affutiated virtues of women among the wboms he had sought for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young year of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more attached to the almost magical form before him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian search, he went away, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the bif attention on the ruins of Tbe around him, while in his mind he resisted an irritation which seemed to be the sole possessor of whispers. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was still the same child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to share fr0m bim wilh reluotance; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite hauntings, whenl ber guarding wcls occupied to sketohing or to rip a wbich fragment had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the underjeet 0f Vampyres, and both, with several present, aborted their existence, pale of horror to the namo itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubreydetermj to carry out one of his exercises, whjcb had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard Tbo narne from the place, all in one stroke begged him not to return at night, for he must pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the mcly had closed, on any considerationatiori. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on hlm who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made many of their representations, and tried to brighten them with the idea; but when he saw that the cm trembled with bis, so dared to mock a superior, infernal powcr, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning Avbrey went on his excursion without lingering; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was amazed to find words, mocking the calamities of these horrible engagements, hod jnspired tobem with fuch terror. When he had the absurdity of leaving, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night cre allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day was going to end soori, and that there was one of the specks thase whieh, iri thc warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring out all their rage von the country doubly.—He at lclst, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. Twice, in these climates of sovthern, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the powcr of the slorm was above — his thunders failed had barely a rest interval — his heavy rain takes on himself through the shell of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and crash at his feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carrified with a terrible speed through the wood set in motion. The Ariimal finally, lhrough satlgue, stopped, and found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not remove 1f from the masses of dead lcaves and 6 brushy w hich surrounded. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him on the t0wn, or at least confident to get a shelter against the storm basin. As he approached, the Lunders, for a silent moment, gave him the opportunity to hear the horrific cry of a woman who mingled with suffocated laughter, exulting, continued in an almost unspoilt ono; — he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder which agairi r0lled on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the daor of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, for, he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed hiin. He found himself in a conlact, a man whom he immediately seized; when a vojce cried out: \"Again gagged!\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt the sons struck by ono whose strength seemed fuperhuman: demise yourself to sell his life as so dear cles that he could, he slipped; but it was in vain: he was lifted up with an onormo-vapante force against the ground: - his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled to his chest, had put his hands von his throat; when the dazzling a lot of torches penetrating into the hole that gave the light in the light in the light, disturbed him; - he surprisingly rouged, and, leaving his prey, rushed thrugb the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now motionless; and Aubrey, incomparable to move, was soon heard by th0so without. They entered, and the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and arid the thatch loaded on each straw with heavy soot straws. Al Aubrey's desire was sought, which had drawn him by his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a corse without life. He closed his cyes, jumping as he waf but an arrogant vlsion of his disturbed imagination; but to be again seen the same form, when being unolosed tbem, stretched by his fidelity. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as attacblng as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was stuffed, and on his throat were the marks of having opened the vein: — that is how men pointed, crying, at the same time struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fcllllen with lho flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his dolphins were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge vacant iri — he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger bone a particular construction, which had heen his in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engulfed in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a dreadfu1 disaster. \"Now their sorrow would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at al-Aubrey, and pointed to Corsica. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAvbrey being pvt in bed was seized of a very uiolent fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he called on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe — by some incomprehensible combinationati0n it seemed your heg of his companion before for sparo the bin that he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, who has now been given the opportunity to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same houso, and bocame his c0nstarit waita nt. When the lattcr recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of 0f hlm which he had now combined with the imclge of a Vompyre; 6ul Lord Ruthven, by kind bis words, involving almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and carcaille which he showed, soon refreezing to his presence. His 1rdship seemed completely changed; he no longer appreciated this apathetic belng which had so appeased Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalescence began to accelerate, he gradually withdrew the jnto from the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not see any difference with the old man, except that at the same time he was surprised to mellow his eyes firmly fixed on him, with a smile of malicjoy exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, LordRuthven was apparently committed to observing the tidal waves raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, circ1ing, like our world, the inoveless smile;—ired, hc seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had once disturbed him so much would be concerned that he had fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but mucb that hc wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he had flourly frequented, the shape of Ianthe ftood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then turning svddenly, would show, with wild imagination, his pale face on the wounded throat, with a soft smile von his lips. Hc decided to steal scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he remembered being bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, to visit these parts of Greee, and yot had not seen. They went in all directions, and joined to the recognition of wbishah; but they hastened out of the place, and did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually implored these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of individualaIs, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended srom claimed dangers. As a result of this, the Council of the\nAbitants, on one occasion they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as a guide than a dogma. On entering, Howeuer, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the tourbillon was the bcd of a torrent, with great inasses of rock descended from the neighbouring preeipjces, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for hardly the whole party was engaged in the narrow pa s, which were surprised by the whistling of bulls near their heads, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, they had begun to move towards the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, in imitating their example, withdrew far behind the shelteririg turn of defilement: but shameful to be thus detained 6y an enemy, who, with insulting cries, advanced them, and to be expiated at the dercsistlng massacre, if one of the thieves should go up abovc and take them there, they dissuade both from rusb towards the front of the enemy's seorch. They had little shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to escape from his frame; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, saon was surprised to see the fawns of the robbers around him — his guards having, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately turned their arms back on their way.\nBy the promises of a large row, Avbrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby oabin; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were more content to keep the entrance until their comrade Shauld returned with the promised sum, for there was an order. Lord Ruthven1y's rapid strength diminished; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty stops. His coricul and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, the bis mnd became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help more than the usual solicitude—\"Help me! I mean not my lily, I have listened to the dcathe of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your frocnd. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need a litlle — rny lifo ebbs apace — I can't explain the whole — but if you concalized everything you kriow, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — arid if death rny was unknown to a man in England—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying nan, rising up with cxulta nt violico, \"Swear by all your soul, searching your nature, swear that if a yeclr happens to you and one day you give to your knowledge my crimes or date to every living being in any way whatsoever you can see. \"His eyos seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was running down his pillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mary circuses assisting him in his knowledge of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when hc remembered his oath a cold chill came the ovcr, as if he were presenting something horrifying waiting for him. At the beginning of the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he left the corpse badly, when a thief the mcl, and informed him that it was not lordy there, baguant was transmitted by himSi et oomrades, at his retirement, the pirinacle of a neighbourjng munl, agreed to a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the baby moon that struck his death. Aubrey marveled, and struck several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But when he had had fun at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or drapes, the thieves welded that they had pointed the same stone on the whilch that they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was embellished by conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that Thoy had buried the orpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superslitic melancholy which had sequestered vpon bis spirit, he resolved to leave JT, arid soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Noples, he occupied deer in the organization of these esfects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Among other things, there were weapons of supply, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were daggors and ataghans. While turning them, and cxaminirig thejr curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with jn tbe samc flyle that one discovers in the fatoI hut — he trembled — hastening to get additional evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equipping, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need to be more energizing — they seemed gastirig to be related to daggor; however, he still wanted to be wary; but the particular shape, some shades uorying upan the haft and sheath were similar in splendor on both, and there was no room for duht; there were also drops of blood on the axe.\nHe left Smyrna, and when he returned to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to rip out Lord Ruthueri's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune was flowing, and it had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postiliori, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted half of the English shorks; and he hastened at the house of his fclthers, and there, for a mountain, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the mcmory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had gairied hjs affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winnirig grace that wins in front of and applause from the salon assemblies. There was n0ne of this brilliant ighl that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a meloncholy chclrm about him whincb did not seem to arise the misfortune of srom, but of a certain feeling inside, which appeared to indalo a conscious soul of the sheltering kingdom. His step was not so light, that he went astray where a butterfly or a colovre could attract – it was sedative and pensive. When Alono, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence those sorrows which she knew destroyed hjs resl, who would have exchanged a ber smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — this face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought by her guardians more fit that his presentation should be delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, that he could be his prolector. It was now resolved that the next salon, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"busy sccne\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay iri the house of his fclthers, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He did not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionahle slrangerf, when the bis spirit had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he torpedoed to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. Soori went into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced for a parlor.\nThe crowd was occessive — a bad nol salon was held for a time of lang, and all the wha were anxiovs to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened there. Aubrey was tbere with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account an 11 around him, engaged in the tbat memory the first time he had fenen Lord Ruthveri was in that same place—he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voico he recognized too well, so long as he was not aware of it.\nDed to his ear — \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a bot of spectrum would explode, when he perceived, at a little distance, the samc figure that had drawn his n0tice to this place when he first entered society. He gagged until the bis limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of clami, and bewitching a passage through the crowd, he threwSi in his car, and was driven home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that he would burst out of his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in the dreadsul painting — the dagger — hif ooth.—He awakened him felf, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead resurrection again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the jmage on which his renf rested. It was impossible for him to be real — he made sure, for that, to go back to society; for although he tried to ask for the cancer of Lord Ruthveri, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in galling up the information. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he removed the irito for a break, and there gave himself to his own eating thovghts. Finally knowing that many were leaving, he woke up and entered Anolher's room, quadrified his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he sent away to move, turned around, they revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. And he sprang up, and took hold of his fist, and, with a rush, forced it toward the street; and at the door he found him blocked by a multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he did not care about Jn, he heard this voice murmuring with him again: «Remember your oath!»\nAubrey almost got distracted. Had the beforc mind hjs been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was engrofsed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attraction was now vnheeded, and it was in vain that shc intimidated him to explain to him what had caused his unruly conduct. He said a few words, and those who terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. He had to let this monster wander, carry ruin on his breath, was he at heart, and riat avoided his progress? His sister mjght bclve was touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and described his suspicions, who would believe him? He used his own hand to free the world from such a whirlwind; bul death, he remembered, bad has already been wicked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw only one, and ate only when his soul sisler, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and hc wanders, as osten cxposod in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer known to him; he returned home at first in the evening; but at last he lay down to rest wherever the fatigue looked at him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people who followed him; but they were so far away by him who fled faster than a fool. However, his conduct changed only at once. Astonished by the idea he left behind by his absence all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious to foresee, despite the oath, all those whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his shrewd and supple eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, his sister was finally dazzled to beg him to refrain from sowing, for her, a faction that touched him so strongly. That in, hawever, resurranoe proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought appropriate to invert, and, fearing that his mind was alienating themselves, they learned that it was high time to take back agajn this trvst which was before imposed upan thcm by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to get him drunk frowned on the sufferings he had daily encountered in his chopsticks, and to prevent him from exposing these rnarks of what they considered to be madness to the general eye, they engaged a physician to stay in tbe hovse, and to take care of him. He hardly seems to notice, if completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible fubiect. His incoherence finally became so great, that he was confined to his choice. He often lied there for days, including being awake. He had become emaoic, his eyes had reached a gimacious chandelier; — the only sign of affection and remembrance reminiscing himself showed themselves to be ilseIf at the entrance of the bis sister; then he sometimes stifled himself, and, by grasping his heels, with the appearances of a gravely distressed tbat, would desire his riot of him with fists. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love is against me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her answer was: \"Truly! True!\" And again he sank inlo a slate, from where she couldn't even wake him up. This lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his incoherents became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a dofinitc number, then smile.\nThe time had rioarly passed, wben, on the last day of the year, ono af his tutors entering his R0om, hegan to converse wilh his physiciari on the melancholic circumstances of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when hjs sister would next mcly to marry. Incontly Aubrey drew attention; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this grudge of intellect, of which he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count with whom he became involved in society, Aubrey contented himself, arid them even more by his expression of his interition to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sistor. They didn't answer, but his sister was with him. He was apparently again capablo of beirig affected by the influence 0f his beautiful sinile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He asked to speak with all his warmth gained, and to corigratulate it on his marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and every achievement; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on the chest bcr; openirig ll, which is really surprising to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his ljfe so long. He captures the portrait of iri a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbaride, he Iooked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at her with an expression frclntic os countenarice, he told her to swear that she would not negate this monster, because he—but he could n0t aduance—it seemed that tal voicegain sade Hjm remembers his oath — he suddenly turned around thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heord tbo whole, and thought it was only a retum of his disorder, entered, and forced him from Misf Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged them to delay, but for a day. They, alpritirig this to the soundlessness they imagined had taken possession of his mind, ended up pacifying him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen called the morning after the living room, and he refused with all the others. When he heard of the evil of Aubrey, he himself was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed in the midst of the water which he had gained. He hastened to the bosom of the former companion of hjs, ond, by the constant presence, and the pretonoe of great clffection for the brother and interest for his destiny, he gra-\nTwice won Miss Aubrcy's ear. Who could resist his power?His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of a bimmoine as an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with it for him to cling to himself;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had bcgun to seem worthy of preservatjon, except that he could listen to her soothing;—in endo, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, 0r such was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the elder branch fell to him for a long time, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's deranged slato), which was to take place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and the guards of hjs, lingered to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked f0r pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, coniuririg, as if it were equaled to him his own happiness, honor, and honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held it in their arms as the hope of the Jr and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hours the tal marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest m0 curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but, giving it to the physjcian, he thought that it was better not to harm Miss Auhrey's spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without resl to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heord, with a horror that could be more easily conceived, described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubroy grew up the almast frantjc. The curiosity of the writing tho finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole aw ay, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a hovnd was out of the room of Tbe, and in a moment found bim se in the apclrtrent where everyone fell asleep riarly. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him into the room, speechless with fury. When Lord Ruthveri, in the stairoase, wept in the ear: \"Render your oath, and if my fiancée is not my fiancée in the day by day, Yaur Sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to the servants who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer smear himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a vessol of blood, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned his sisler, which is not present that he entered, as the doctor was afraid of agitatig her. The marlage was solemnized, the bride and husband left Loridon.\nThe weakness of Aubrcy iricreased; the blood efsusion produced symptoms of the approach close to dcath. He disinterested his sister's guardians and, when midnight was beaten, it was written what the reader had perpetuated: he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the lowest of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where his resting place shone, and Providence his guide.\"\nOn board one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put in the Grccien Archipelago, on the island of lhat, the Har6our 0f Mitylene. The beauty of this plain, and the certainty of always having cattle and vegetables there, led many British ships to visit the men of war and the merchants; and it was rather off the track for the ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums paid a great deal for the deviati0n to a uoyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were watered, and the handbag bathed for the cattle with the nativity, the ecclesiastical, and I took aramble to the cave called Homer's School, engulfed by the herses, where we had been besieged. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain thus named) we met and engled a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio wjth an English lord, who left TB is 1 and 4 days before our arrival jn his felucca. \"He set me up as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he took me with him; \"but I did not choose to tell Mltylene, where I am likely to marry.\" He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, knowing the river, 6 runs along to the bim, and he has 1st an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the merchant of wlne, six hundred and two machines for her, (about L25O curroncy English,) and has resided here about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nTbis has excited our euriosity very much, and we have not wasted the time to hasten at home where our countryrnan had resided. An old man kindly welcomed us, who led us into the mansion. It is composed of four separate rooms on the ground floor: a bathroom, a drclwing-r0om, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated in a sirnply way: wa1ls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center of the tob, and a small brieath flower, which could be made to play near the 6ranches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning possure; a sofa largo or sofa completed the furniture. In the hail stood a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ase: there were mirrors of rio, rior a point of slrigle. The bedroom had only a great maltress spread on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pil1ow, the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the living room that we observed a mclrble break, once, the old man told us, full of books and papers, which were theri in the chest of a largc sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contents. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire, Shokspeare, B0ileau, and the works of Rousseau eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari langvage; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the game of Schiller's thieves; the Paradise of Miltan Lost, the Italian odition ari, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greok press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were illuminated with marginal notes, brittcn with a pencil, in Italian arid Latin. Tbe Mesfiah was literally serialized everywhere, and marked with s1ips of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books eternally before he eclipsed himself, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he surrenders; for he is so particular, that if I were moving a blow without order, he would frown upon me for a week of lodging; he is a very good stranger. I did him a favor once, and I did the product of the farm for the pain of taking care of it, except for the zechins of the twerity which I pay to an Armenian who is set in motion and is walking in a small chest in the woods, and which the Lord has dug here in Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the externaIly house was plcasing. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of canned marble with black lanterns and work orniches of frets (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were significantly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a purr of coarse linen strrig. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pclss their evenings by smoking, drinking light wonos, such bones \"lochryma christi\", eating frujt, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lirnes gathered togetbers on its borders, undcr the sbade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with a back of ornamental woodwork was placed, or we have wcre at ld, the lord spent mony from his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he was very pious, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called a bird view. At 1ino os rich virieyards led the eye to Mount CaIcIa, covered with olive and myrtle tree in bloom, and on the summary of whlcb an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic rot. A small strcam from the ruins descended from the waterfalls of jn brokeri, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. Tbesea smooth as glass, and the horizon ari darkened by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and o a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small isIands wcro clearly 0served, spreading the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I rarely enjoyed a vlew m0re thcln Idid that; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who bcld resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Cand-\n\"The Armenian, saddened our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't,\"—and can't you tcll, old friend?\" he said, \"If I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We don't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the bass, we took several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was 1st on the island, and had even danced with them at the nupal feast. He saw a cow t0 a man, horses to the athers, and cotton and silk to the girls wbo live by weaving these arliclef. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greok Testaments to the poor dogs. In short, it appeared to us, from everything we collect, as a very eccentric and caring character. Uncircumstances that we have learned, thatjoh our old frierid at the score thought appropriate not to reveal. He had a very valiant daughter, with whom tbelord wos often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and hcld bought him o piano-fart, and taught him himself the usc of it.\nSucb was the information we left in 0m the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination all about the rack, gvessing that this ramb1er in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of disposal, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our dovbts disappeared. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pulpi1 of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene.\" We had then heard about the fame of hjs Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put in our hands wc recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in each page. Let us deeply regret not having 6een more curious in our rosearchs at the cottage, but we comfort ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene the next day s0me; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, saying that it is not without interest, and in justice in the good name of his seigneury, which has been grossly ruined. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with humble nature, or in any way contributing to soothing its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverf, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his l0rdship, scem to have their seat in his bosom. Tondity, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason for the markirig, it is a song on whose heart the Religion has put his bosom, and the ovcr whose head Benevolerice has cast his coat. No inan can read the previous pleasant \"trails\" without feeling proud of him or a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opjnion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself must be horrified where all the mvst appear, only can censor the mistakes of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in the dry, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surost testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "2": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arbians, it seems common: however, it does not extend to the Greeks until the establlfhrnt of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its form presounded from the divisiori of the churohcs Latjn and Greek; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, shot a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it increased graduated, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood, young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with the same variation of ligure, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and L0raine, which attenuated the helief cxjstod, that the night vampyres lmbibe some of the blood of their victims, who became emaciatcd, increased their strength, arid quickly died of consuinctions; that these human blood suckers fatten—and their lders dissolve to such a state of repletiori, as to cause blood to flow on all passages of their bodies, and even fram the pores even of the skins of the tbeir.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious, and, of course, the credible reception of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is declared a haue, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cassvia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating some bones from the earth of the vampy grave, and ripping off his blood. But this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, twenty or thirty days after his death and death, many people complained of being tortured by him, and a deposiliation was made, that four porsons had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To prove even more evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as is assumed to be vsual in cases af vampyrism) frosh, and completely free of corvption, and emitting to movth, n0se, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the personalized remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is repainted for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. This done, they took out Osf his pearl, 6urnod his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these people wb0 bad provously dead of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, become agents on others who survived TBem.\nThe uriversal helief is that a person sucked by a vampy himself makes a vampy, and sucks in his stomach.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subjoct of observation presounds than any other inslance that is added to it. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crimo committed while in existencecnc, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to confiscate his inferna1 visits only to beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection.\nBut, as Vampyre sent him, your Corsica will be torn from the tomb of them; then, hunl the place of origin, and suck the blood of all your race; from there, from your daughter, sjster, woman, around midnight draln the stream of lifo; yet hate the banquet that must feed tby livid livirig Corsican, Your victims, are tbey yol exhale, Know the devil for their sire; As you cursed, Tbou cursed them, Your flowers are wjthered on the stem. Bvt onothal for your crime falls mvst, The youngest, the best loved of all, Sholl bless you with the name of a father—This word will wrap your heart in flaino! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the laslspark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand without stain will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a look when the tender offering of affection has been carried — but now is supported awcly by you Memorial of your agony! But with the best drop of blood of himself, your grinning tooth, and the lip of the hook; then tracking your tomb of sulfur, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll those in horror depart from the cursed dark spectrum tban them.\nMr. Southcy hos also presented in his cool but beaupoem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the housekeeper Tbo Arabian Orieiza, who is represented as having turned sram the grave with the intention of tormenting bim that she liked better wbilst in existinc. But this cannot be due to the sinfulness of her life, she being paurtrated by the whole tale as a complete type of purity arid innocentness. The veracio nous Tournefort gives a long story in bis voyages of several surprisingly easy vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of oncdotes, and traditionalistic narratives jullustrative of his esfects, put forb a few dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as Borbarian.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and that the medium is now corincid by merely pointing out, that tub the term Vampyre is that in most genres, there are severa1 other synonyms with it, makes use of iri different parts of the world: like Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parts of the ton's Eaders, more resemblable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked around, if he could take part in the riots. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into those breakls where carelessness reigned. Those who sealed this feeling of awc could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whjcb, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, to a girice, to pierce the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on a cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houscs; a1l wanted to see him, and these wh0 had been acclaimed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, wero happy to have somothing in their capclable presence of enclging their attcntion. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which never rolled a warmer hue, either of the puff of modostia, or of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours wore beautiful, many female bunkers swollen notorjety tried to win her attonations, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mocker of all monsters dressed in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountain bank, to attract her riot:—although in vairi:—where she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed upwards She, however, seemed not to have been perceived; even her unapplauseed impudence was flouted, and she left the fiold. But the adultery commune could not even influence the direction of its egg, it was not that the female sex was indifferent t0 him: however, he was apparently cautious with whom he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, tal little knew that he was never speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a victorious language; and even if he was stifled by the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his hatred appears from vice, he was also often among those women who formed the van of their sex from their mestic virtuoso, asamong thossc who su1ly by the vices.\nConcerning the somo timo, a young gentleman named Avbrey arrived in London: he was orphaned 1stft with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also himself by the guards, who, however, their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the greater burden of the Bi mind to the subalternal mercenary cleavages, he cultivated his immclgiriatlori more than his iudgment. He therefore had this romantic feeling of h0nour and candour, which dei1y ruined so many apprentices of millers. He believed everything to sympathize with uirtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria only for the picturesque esfeet of the scene, af wo see in the romances: he thought that the insemination of an oottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were so warm, hut that were 6etter adclptod to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the drcams af poets were the realities of llfe. Ho was beautiful, frank, rich: for these reasons, on his engagement in gay circles, many mothers encircling bim, sluving while should describe with the least truth their lclrigidants or crawling favors: the davghters in the same ti me, 6y their brilliant faces as he approaches, and by the sparkling eyes of bir, when he opens his lips, he soon led him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the tallow and wax candles tbat flickerod, nool of the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffsing, there was ria foundation in real life for one of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, from wbich he had formed his study. However, finding a certain compenfation iri his gratified vanity, he was about to demand his dreams, what extraordinary is it being we abaue deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the impossibility tho vory to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other sig ns of his observation of external objects, tacit thari lhe acquiesce in their existence, imp1ed by the avoidance of their oontact: to allow the imagination to imagine all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formed this objecl as hero of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the perfon in front of him. He met HLM, paid attention to him, and so far advanoed on his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's fairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to fly away. Desiring to obtain information about this slngular cabracter, who, until now, had only bis curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which, for many generations, thought necessary t0 entangle young people to take a few quick steps jn the caroeur of vice towards putting theirelvef on an equal with the elderly, and not lowering them to appear as if flalleri from heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of plea or praise, reconciling to the degree of competence they are to be carried. Thyy consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal from the jojn. Flattened by such a mark of estecmus of him, who apparently did not have in common with the men of otbcr, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circular water.\nHilherto, Avbrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lard Ruthven, and now he found, that, although many of his actions have been exposed from the bis point of view, the results have been subjected to different coricclusions based on the apparent motives of his conduct. His appearance was abundant in his liberality; — the idle vagabond, and the beggar, received from his morc hclnd that has enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not abort to notice, that he was born on the vltuous, driven to indignation by the misfortunes Even waiting up the virtue, which ho gave his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes with barely removed; but when the profligal camo for afk something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. It was, howevor, attributed by him to the greatest imporlunity of the vicious, who generally foresee the retirement of the virtuous igenl. There, a circumstance abovts the charity of his Lordship, whoh was even more impressed on his mind: all those on wbom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curvature on it, for they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brusfels arid other cities that lhey passed, Auhrey was surprijzed attho apparent oagerness with whjch his companion sought for the centers of all life in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always played successfully, except where the known gullion was his antagonist, and then he lasted even more than he won; but it was always with the sclme immutable face, with which he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, fo when he met tbe young novioc, or the father without chance of a family number0us; then his very desire seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction af mental appearance was laid clslde, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of tho cal while dallylng with the bat mouse. In each city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness af a dongean, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of tbis fiend; while many a father sat fraritic, in the midst of the spialirig airs of hungry children, without one end of his immense latc wealth, wherewjth to buy even suffloi t0 their present desire. Yet he did not take money srom lhe game tablc; but immcdiately lost, at the ruinous 0f many, the last gun der that he had just removed from the convulsive take of the innocent: this mig ht but being the result of a certain degree of bone knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the most experienced cunnirig bone. Auhrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this chastisement and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; — but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to show him frankly and openly; however, it never worked. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and in the midst of the wild-ond varjus rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke of the loss as his lip; and although Aubrey was the object of bis frillosity, he did not obtain a gratjfication gratjficious of her that the constant excitation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, whlch to his imaginatiori b egan lo assvme the appearance of something superematvral.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey spent time lost sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room on the morning circle of an Italian count, while he went in search of the inemorials of the almost deserted back town. While he was engaged, letters adorned the fried England, which he opened impatiently; the fjrst came from his sister, breathing nothing from the affection of the huts; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had been besieged that there was an evil power residing in his companion, this seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards immediately insisted on his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, for the possessor of irresistible power of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adulterer had not arisen in the hatred of the horcharacter; but he had asked, in order to strengthen his satisfaction, that his victim, the partner of the culprit bis, should be precipitated from the pinnacle of the unsouled virtue, to the lowest abyss infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those femcl that he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and evil did not scruple to expose all the defect of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shown a single point of brick ht on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to annoy him completely, to seek, in the sense, to watch him swear closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, as his Lordship waf erideovouring to work on the inexperience of the davghter of the lady whose house he mainly friquered. In Italy, it is rare for an unmingled woman to be met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignatjon had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of the jnnocenl, although killing daughter. Losjng not the time, he elevates Lord Ruthven's apartment, and asks him abruptly for his intentions towards the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his bejng about to meet her that same night. Lord Ruthuen replied, that the intentions of hjs were such that he pleasep0sed all hue on suoh an opportunity; and being in a hurry whatber, he intended to marry him, me only laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that srom this moment must refuse to accept his Lordfhip in the proposed tbeir remalnder, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and callirig vpon the lady's mother, informed him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordshlp. The Ofsignatian has been proven. The next day, Lord Ruthven simply senk his servanl to notify his camplet of agreement to a separation; but did not mention any suspicion of his first year having been thwarted by the interpasitian of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his stcps to Greece, and crossed the Penirisula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his house of residence of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself by tracing the rcc0rds faded from monuments upori of ancient glory which apparently, shame of chroniclirig the relations of free only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichen. Under the same machinery as he, there existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a pclinter wanting to pour on canvases the hopo promised by the faithful into the paradise of Mohammed, savo thclt her eyes spoke too much of spirit so that someone thought that she might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plairi, or stumbled along the side of Movntan tbe, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her bcauties; for who would have expended her eye, apparently the eye of the onimade nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the adapted Arimal but the taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the careless girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, what forgot the lecherins he had just deciphered on a nearly erased tablet, in the contemplation of his sylph-1ike figure. Ofton wanted her braids to fall, while she flattered araund, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the shades, he might well excuse the oblivion of the anliquary, wbo letting escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Why describe charms that one feels, but that the rione can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, indulgence, indulgence, lack of overcrowded rooins and stifling bullets. While HC drew the remains which he used to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of hjs penoil, tracing the sccnes of his place of origin; she then described to him the dance circIjng on the open plairi, wovld paired, to him in all the dazzling aloeurs of youthful memory, the pomp of marriage that she encompassed in her youth; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a sense of cleoler on her mind, told him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His fortune and his apparent 6elf of what she irritated, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the dearest, forced each year, by nourishing the life of a woman in love to prolong her existence during the learned months, her blo od would run cold, that he would be tempted to laugh at her from so many idle and miserable santases; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of old reindeer, who had at last detected one living among the lhemselves, after several of her parents and children had been found to be badly marked by the buffer of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so impulsive, she begged him to believe her, far it had been, noticed, that those who had dared to seek their exifterice, always hcld somc pr0of given, which forced them, the grief of mind and heart broken, to the truth. She broke away from bim the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror grew, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, to be always persuasive in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same lime wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belie in Lord Rutbven's superritarian power.\nAubrey asked to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted by all the infected virtues of the used am0ng that he had sought for his vision0f romance, gained the heart bis; arid whoe he ridiculed the idea of a young renan of the Eriglâtre habits, marrying a Greek girl uneducated, still more and more he was more and more attached to the almost Sairie form the bef0re. He sometimes rips off from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian reef, he goes away, determined not to return to his object was reached; but to be always found impossible to fix his atteriti0n on the ruins around him, while in his mind he removed an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his sincells. Ianthe was unconscious of the love of hjs, and was still the same frank child he had known the first time. She always used to split up from bim with reluctancc; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could vis-à-vis her favorite havnts, while her guardian was taken up in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that hod yct escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they bollh, wlth seueral present, affirmed their existence, pa1e with horror in the name itself. Soon a ster, Aubrey decided to proceed to one of his oxen, who had to hold him for a few hours; when they harded the noun of the place, they all at once begged him not to come back at night, as he should not go through a wood, where no Greek could ever, after the day had closed, on any considerationatlon. Thoy described it as the resort of lhe uompyres jri their nocturnal orgies, and announced the most ugly evils as imminent on him that dclred to cross their palh. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey put Oss unattended on his excurfion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his pupils, mocking the belief of these horrible fjends, had inspired them to such terror. As he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to resign himself, and he allowed the power of these beings to be put into action. However, he was so busy in his research, that we did not see that doy-lighl was about to end, and that on the horizon there was only one spot which, in the warmest climcltes, so fast1y assembled in a hectic mass, and poured all their rclge over the devoured land.—He was however the last, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immoderately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echo thundering bad barely a resting irriterval — his heavy tbick rairi forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, when1st the blue lightning f0rked seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse took the frigate, and they carried it with terrible speed in the entangled forest. The animal finally, through the fat...\niguc, stoppode, and he found, 6y lbe dazzling from lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose up from the mafes of dead water and brushwood surrounding him. Demonstrating, he objected, jumped to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trusling to get a shelter from the pclting 0f lhe ftorm. As he approached, the thunders, in a silent word, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, contaminating in 0ne almost without flash of sovnd; — he was surprised; but, excited by a tbunder who rolled again on his head, he, with a hard effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself iried himself from the absolute darkness: the smile, however, the gujded. He was apparently imperious; for although he had scattered, the aurids continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found him in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a uoice cried out: \"Always mocked!\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh, and that he himself was struck by a force which he seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his most expensive lily that he could, wrestled; hut in vain: he was lifted from his feet and thrown by the enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw him on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his hands on his throat — when lho dazzled many torohes penetrating into the hole of TB, which jn the light of the day, disturbed him; — he stood up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the stake of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. Tho storin was now silt; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard 6y those without. They entered, the light of their fe1l torches on the mud walls, and the ladod stubble on the individual straw evcry with heavy soot flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey, she was sought who had attracted him to his cries; he was forgotten in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torches once in0re burst upon him, to pierce the airy f0rm of his righteous drivers burned in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vjsion coming from imaginatively disturbed hjs; but ho agairi saw the same form, that he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colovr on his cheek, not even on the ber lip; but lhore was a silence on his thal facue seemed almost as attached as the life there was once: — on his rieck and chest was hlo0d, and on his throat were the rnarks of the teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A year soon arose, and Aubrey was laid next to his wbo had recently been for him the object of so many bright and magical vislons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held most of his hand a bare dagger of a pa ricular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parties who had been questioned in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but that they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chore. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrcy being put at 6ed was seized of a very violent fever, and was often delirious; at the same intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by an incompetent combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated my dictions upori his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanocd at this time to arrive in Athens, and, of some motivc, vpon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hjmseIf in the same h0use, and became his constant atladen. When the lattcr recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and amazed at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with this 0f o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost involving repentance f0r that the fault caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care that he slipped, soon reconoiled him to the presence bis. His seigneury seems completely changed; he no longer takes possession of the apathetic being who was so astonished by Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the old, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his fixedly raised gclze, with a malicious exullation smile playing on his lips: he did not know wby, but this smile haunted him. During the latent stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently looking at the waves of tides raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of these orbs, turning like our world, tbe still sun;—in fact, he clinged to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weakened mvch, and this elasticity of the mind whincb had once so distinguished it now seemed to have flod for ovor. Today he was as fond of solitude and solitude as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, the bis spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; he sought him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he were to sweep her in the woods, his slight step might seem wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly lunning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded lhroat flaw, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, each characteristic of wbjch created suchbitler associations iri his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held hesolf bound by the care to leiter whom he had taken from him during his illness, that he should visit the parts of Greeoe neither hod yet seen. They moved in a very firm direction, and moved to every place where a memory could be attached; but they hastened from one place to another, but they did not begin to listen to what they were looking at. They heard a lot of people, but they gradually began to look at these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result, neglecting the counsel of the inbebitants, they once had only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a dosenco. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of whooh was the bed of a torrent, with the masses of lclrge rock descended from the blackbo-\nDuring the rushes, they have bad reasons to fall back on their negligence; for they barely went to the whole party engaged in the narr0w pass, when they were wired by the whistle of bullets it is at their head, and by the soothing ratio of several cannons. In an instant, the guards had left TBem, and, placing themselves rocks, had begun to pull jn the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turri sheltering defilement: bvt shame to be so hated by an enemy, who wjth insults to make them move forward, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should climb ab0ve and take them back, they decided to onoe to rush in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven took a bullet back into his shoulder, which dug it down. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the c0ntest or his own peril, he was surprised to see the faces of robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rulhven's wounded, immediately cast their arms and shaken.\nBy promos of great reward, Aubrey soon encouraged him to transport his wounded friend to a nearby ca6in; and having agreed on a ransom, hc was no longer distracted by the TBJr presence — they simply kept the entrance until their compass came back with the promised sum, for which he had the order. Lord Ruthven's strength declined rapidly; in two days morliflcati0n followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as careless of the pain as he had no bad beakers of the objects that surrounded him; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with more than usual – \"Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I have taken into account the death of my life as quiet as the passing day; but yav can save my hanour, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey replied. \"I need, but few things — my reading collapses — I can't go to the end — but if you comfort me all those who know me, my honor was free to die in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I—but lifo. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Jurez!\" cried the dying man, raising himself in the midst of a vi...\nIcnce, \"Swear by all your saviors, by all your fears of naturo, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your kn0wledge of my crimes or death to any life moaning in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was flowing over his pillow, and brcathod rio more.\nAubrey withdrew from rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his aquaintance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivorling came the ovrr, as if it came from the presence of something horrible waiting for bim. From the beginning, he was about to enter into the coffin in which he did not have the body, when a thief had the methim, and brought him in, he was na langer, having been transported by him and the cainrads, at his retreat, at his top of a nearby mountain, according to the promise that they had given his seigneury wrong, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his teeth. Aubrey was surprised, and hit several of the men, decided to bury him in the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of eithcr body or clothes, the thieves swore that they were reporting the same rock on which they had stretched the body. For some time his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he finally stood back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the soke of clothes.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared conspired for heatcn lhat superstitious melanch0ly had grasped his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there has been one case of complicity of several groups of offers, more or less adapted to ensure the death of vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While returning, arid looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the samo style as the dagger discovered in the falale hut—he trembled—hasteri to get other evidence, to be found weapon, and the horror can be imagined when being defamed that he would, although strangely in shape, equal the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need them, they seemed to be linked to the dagger, but he still did not want to believe; but the particular farm, the same varied shades on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room ser doubt; tore wcre also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to remove Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents are in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. Aubroy's beoamo spirit almost broke under so many abrogated horrors; he feared that his lady had made a victim to Ianlhc's destroyer. He became morgue and silent; and his only occupation was to insist on the speed of the postilions, as if he were glng to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wil11, soon swirled to the English shores; and he hastened to the home of his fathers, and the threshing, for a land, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a memory of past tho. If before, by her infantile carosses, she had won her affection, now that the woman did not seem to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey had no grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There is none of this light shine that exists only in the cured atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the leuity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about it that djd does not seem to pose fram unlucky, but some feeljng wildbin, which seemed to indicate a s0ul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not so light, which misleads a butterfly or a co1ovr mcly atlract – he was sedated and pensive. Wben alone, his face was never lightened 6y the smile of j0y; bul when his brother breathed to his hls afsection, and got into his pre--\nIf you forget these deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have excavated her smile for the voluptuary's lhat? He shook as if those eyes,—lhat sace then played in the light of their own nativo sphere. She was only eight years old.\nIn, and had not been introduced your world, it was thought by its guardians more appropriate that its presentation should be delayed bo until the retum of his brother from the continent, wben hc could be his protector. So it was now resolved that next tbo show, which was the quick approval, should be the time of its entry into the \"bvsy fcene.\" Aubrey would have preferred to remarry in the manslon of the father bis, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not be interested in the srivolities of the most fashionable, when his mind had been torn apart by the uniforms he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his pride to the protection of his sister. They soon entered t0wn, and prepared for the next day, which had been set in motion like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and it was anxi-\nYou get used to the smile of royalty, you're quick to have fun. Aubrey was there with his sistcr. Whi1e he was stoned in an oorner by himself, devoid of everything around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he suddenly felt secluded by the arm, and a voice ho recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly the courage of tum, pretending to see a spectrum that would be 6last bim, when he perceives, at a little distance, the same figure who had clarted his opinion on this place on his first entry lnto saciety. He looked until his members refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take a friend's weapon, and force a passage through the crowd, threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and fastened his hands up his head, as if he were afrising his thoughts burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthvon again in front of him – oircumstrives began in the awful picture – the dagger – his oath. – He woke up, he could not believe that this was possible – the dead are resurrected again! – He thought his imaginative idol had wronged the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real—he decided, about him, to return to the company int0; so although ho tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining information. He began to sew nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a corner, and there he gave himself to his own devastating thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awakened, and eroding Ariother's room, fed his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he had scratched lo motion, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he had the most horror. He pushed her to the door, he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords, and while he was committed to passing them, he again heard that the way murmured near him – \"Remember your oath!\" – He did not dare to dye, but, pressed his sister, he quickly returned home.\nAubrey became distracted almast. So if his mind had been absorbed by a svbject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now the certainty of the monster's livjng has pressed again on his thovghtf. Her sistcr's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed him to explain to him what caused her abrupt conduct. He did only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath invaded him, and, in the midst of all that he cherished, he removed this monster so that he might roam, bearing rvin over his breath, and not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would relieve him? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he was born again, had already been m0cked. For days he remarried in this state, rose up in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes floating in tears, begged him, his sake, to support the riature. Finally, no longer opahle calm and loneliness, lest his pride, wander from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he deflated, as often exposed t0 the midday sun as to the humid indnight. He was not 1onger to be recognised; at the first hc return with the evening at home; but to lasl be lying down him to rest where fatigue more took on him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people t0 following him; but he was distracted by him who ran away from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, h0wever, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left his brothers' wollc, with a fiend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he decided to enlist again in society, and looked at him closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all those whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and hagnar eyes were intriguing, shivering hif iriward so visible, that his sjster wos finally had to beg for him to refrain from fairing, for the love of ber, society cl which affects so strongly cdhim. When, blindly, rem0nstrance proved to be urialistic, the guards thought it was good to intervene, and, pretending that his mind became alienated, they thought it was high to take up this trust which had been upofed upan lhem before by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the housc, and take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible ono subject. His inconsistency became so great the last time, that he was confined to his cottage. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a giassy lvstre; — the only remaining sjgn of affection and remembrance manifested himself at the entrance of his sister; then he sometimes began, ond, to grasp his hands, with grips that afflicted him in a severe way, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim – if your I0vc for me is a boon, don't come near him!\" When, at the time, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" and agaln being sunk jnta a state, from which the same sbe could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: little by little, commentevcr, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and if the mind threw a porlion of its morosity, while its guardians observed, that once in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smilc.\nThe time had not passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiciari about the melancholic circumstances of Aubrey's incursion in such a terrible crisis, when his sister went the next day to get married. Instantly Aubrey's attitude was attracted; he asked anxiovsly whom. Happy with this brand 0f relumining jritollect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they incited the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking tbis wos a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed pleaded, and astonished even more by his expression of his intellect to be present to the nuptials, and decisiring to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes the sister was with him. Hc was apparently again able to be affected by the irfluonce 0f his beautiful fmile; for he pressed her to her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the lhaught to brotber to be onco moro living at the expense of affcctjon. He began to speak with all his warmth and congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his rank and all his achievements; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his hail; the experimenting one, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait of lna poroxysm af ragc, and set it on foot. On his askirig seemed to him not to understand why he thus distracted the resemblance of his future Husbaride, so he looked as if he did not understand — then by grabbing hcr hands, arid looking at his mind a frantic expression of face, swearing that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not cling—yet seemed as if this voice again asking him to remember his oath—he suddenly turned, linking Lord Ruthveri was near bim butsaw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a turning point in her disorder, entered, and saw Miss Au6rey, overturning her to leave him. He fell his knees up, implored them, begged them to delay them, but one day. They attached this to the holiness they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvcri had called in the morning after the living room, and 6th had refused with the ury another. When he took care of Aubrey's evil, he readily understood to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered an Irisane, his exultatjon and his pleasure could be blindly concealed from these am0rig that he had obtained this information. He settled at the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and by the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he began to listen to Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his powcr? Hjs Tangue had dangers and tasks to tell — could speak of himself as an individual who has no sympathy for any overcrowded being of the earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself; — could say how, since he knew hcr, his existence, had begun to seem dreadful of preservation, if he was mcrcly that he could listen to his foot accents;—in sinus, he knew well how to use the art of Theserpent, or such wcls the will of destiny, that he won his asfections. The title of the elder's branch fell to him in length, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in the splte of his brother's disturbed state,) which was lo taken p1ace the same day he already had his dowry for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, 6ut in vain. He asked for a paper arid with feathers; it was the gjven; he put a lelter to his sister, wounding her, as she enjoyed her own happinesf, ber own hon0ur, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who held him in their arms as a hope to bet and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours the tal marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sorcerers promised that they would deljvorer him; but by giving him to the physicist, he would do better not to harass Miss Auhrey's mind any more by, what he would coriside, rauings of a maniac. The night passed on the spiritual rost to the occupied inmates of the h0use; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the notos of the occupied preparation. Morriant came, and the sound of cartages broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servaritsat finally overcame vigilance, they gradually stole the aisle, leaving it in the gulf of an old wearan without vergogne. He seizes the opportunity, with a waf bourid out of the room, and in a moment found hjinself in the apartment where a1l were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthveri was the fjrst to perceive him: hc imprenedialy oppressed, and, taking his arm by forco, the shake of the room, furious speechless. Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear, \"Remember your arid, know, if my fiancée does not want to do, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" Thus he pushed Hjm to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to Searcb ofhim. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had no end at Vont, had broken a vase of blood, it was agreed to hold. It was n0t mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eluded, the pbysician was afraid to shake it. The wedding was salemnjzed, and the bride and the bridogroom lefl London.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; bloodshed has led to symptoms of near-death approaches. He wanted his sister's Guclrdians to be shaken, and when midnight had passed, he camouflagedly recounted what the throclder struck, and immediately died.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven made his appearance, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the hair of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nREPORT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON,&c.\n\"The world has six years before bim, where to choose its rest tray, arid Providence guide.\"\nIN Sailjng throvgh the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put irito the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi with cattle and vegetables always to be bad lhero, lead many British ships to visit it — both men of war and men of rnerchest; and it is rather out of the way for ships linked lo Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the gap or a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay of Tbe, men were piled up to water them, and the stock exchange man was negotiating with the chemists with the cath1o, and the clergy and I were taking a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and in other places, where we had been in favor. On the front of Mount Ida (a small monticulque so named) we met and hired a young Greek like our gould, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho ongagcd me as a pilot,\" soldered the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a strange man, a very good man. Tbe cottage ovcr tbe hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he is afraid that an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six zechins grouped for her, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there from 6 to fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the various islands.\"\nThis habit has aroused our curiosity a lot, and we have not wasted any time hastening into the house where our compatriot had resided. We were received by an old man, who led us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with an anoxed spaciaus closet. They were all simply decorated: greeri walls, marble tables 0n on each side, a large myrtle jn the center, and a small fountain beneoth, whicb could be made to play thr0ugh branches by pressing a spririg fjxed in the bone side a srall bran2e Verivs iri a leendirig p0sture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a half-carie English dazen chairs, and a book empty-facility: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The chambranle had only one large mattress lying on the float, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the common mat throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed corners, once, the thealde man told us, filled with b0oks and papers, which were tben in the chest of a great feman in tbe claset: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to exclude the eonents. On the establishment of the rees were Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roufseau's Warks compiete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German tbe; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobue's n0vels; Schiller's play of the Rabbirs; Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in I81o; several small pamphlets of Greek tho prefs at Constantinople, much torn, but no Englifb book of any description. Mosl of tbeese books filled with marginal notes, wrjtten with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, arid marked with paper sips, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had been lurriging these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with the other; but, he said, they must lie here until his return; for it is so special, that if I move something with orders of soul, ho would frown me for a week together; it is indeed very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of the farm for the evil of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottagc in the waod, which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the horsse externally bad pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen braad, on the canned pillars m arble wilh plinths black and corriches of work of frets, (as it is now custamary in Greek architecture,) were considered higher than the roof of tobe. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was wrapped by a fine tile of Tvrkey, benealh an awning of coarse strong linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings iri sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating frvit, and enjoying ying lhc evening breeze.\nFor fear that we would enter the house, a small stream would go away, grpcs, oranges and lindens would gather together on its borders, and under the sha of bones two large bushes of spelling were placed a seat of marhle, an ornamental wooden back, on the dock, we are told that the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church for a week, except on Sundays.\"\nTho vicw of this siege was the whale perhaps called \"a bird-eyo view. \"A linen of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in blouse, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in mcljestio deeay. A small stream from the ruins descended into a broken waterfall, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a l jttlc on the 1o, near a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several fmallis1ands were distinguished, stvddirig the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Domnolok, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"may hang on, but I am furious he will not do it,\" \"and carinot tell you, old friend?\" said I, \"if I can,\" said hc, \"I dare not. We did not bother to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city we learned several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was the last island of Tbe, and even danced with them at Tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also gags a new hoof for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gives Greek tests to the poor chiidren. In short, he seems...\nTo us, of all that we have called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage bought clean not to reveal. He had a better daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-sort, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, gucssing that thjs crawling to Groece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a disposition phi1anthropy, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, \"on wham you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited hlm in Mililene.\" We misheard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years fr0m home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Calclcl in each page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylone on the same future day; bul to me thclt day will never come back. I render this state of mind, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of bis Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an insensitive dispositit0n, averse to associate with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is djreotly the opposite, as can bo plairily collected from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegant ly doped in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their soot in his bosom. Sensitivity, sym...\npathetic, and charity seems to guide his actions: and hjs courting tbe rest of s0litude is an additional reason to mark him as 0n whose heart Religion has put his seal, and On whose head Benevolence cast her coat. No man can read the \"traits\" of pleadings until he is proud of himself as a peasant. As far as his love or love is concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify them before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrere-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, ond shvn the applause of the world, is the svret testimony of a viruous heart and a conscience of approval schlf-approving.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "3": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Polidori\nTHE superstilion on which this story is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it does not extend, however, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the duezion of the Latin and Greek church; at times, the ldea being predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subjeet of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the rislng dead of their graus, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, to Hungary, Polclnd, Austria, and Lorraine, where there was beief, thal vampyres riightly imbibed o some parts of the blood of their victims, who had emancipated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these blood-sucking humans were fattening-\nand their veins have become distended to such a state of repulsion, in order to shed the blood of all passages of their bodies, and even pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curch account, and, of course, credi6lo of a particular case of vampyrism, whooh is said to have accused Madreyga, in the Hungory. It seems that, in an examination af tbe commclnder-in-Chef of the arid magistrates of the square, they positivoly and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years earlier, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been attached to say, that in Cassouia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been t0rmented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of evil, removing part of the earth from the tomb of the vclmpyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. This preclusion, however, did not prevent him from being a victim of vomiting himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death, many people complained that they had been victims of burial and demovement, four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, t0 took the body, and found it (as is supposed bo usuol in cases 0f vampyrism) fresb, arid completely free from corruption, and to throw himself into the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and slorid blood. As the evidence was obtained, lhcy resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was thrown on Arnold Poul's heart and body, where he would have been as dreadful as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and shut his body, and cast the ashes into his rubble. The same measures were adopted with the corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, if they were, iri their turn, to become agents on others who were monitoring lhem.\nThe universal believes that a person sucked by a vampyre gets sucked by a vampyre and sucks in turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of the current observations than any other forum that might be presented. The parts of Iri mclny like Greece it is considered a sart os punjshmerit after death, for a heinous crime committed while it was in existence, thclt the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit the bi-infernal visits only to those he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes to \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the dry land, like Vampyrene, thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and Tben shall haunt the place of origin, and shall suck the six moons of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, unto the night drain of the life of the stream; and yet hate the banquet of Tbe, which persecutes Musl, shall feed thy living corse, thy victims, and shall perish, and know the devil for their tears: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best wretched of all, will bless you with the name of a sadric — This word will engulf your heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy gianc must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, the tear of the hand The braids of his yellow hair, of the whip, in life a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn — But now is born by the memorial of your agony! But with the best bl0od himself will flow; thy grinchy tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at thy svllen bove, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyre c0rsse of the Arab rnaid Oneiza, who is repeseritedas hauing returned from the grave for the purpose of tormener, she loved better what is in existence. But this can't be supposed to have had as a result the sinvlness of her life, she h cing poured into tbe wholo of the tale af o complete type os purity and innocence. The Veraciovs Tournefort makes a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for what he claims to have beeri an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besjdes a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrated by his effeets, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a clafsic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the presont may suffice for the links of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and the whicb can now be concluded by merely pointing out, that if the term Vampyre is the one in general accepted, there are several other fynonyms with it, makes use af in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared at the various fairs of the chiefs of the ton, more noticed for his singularities than for his rank. He looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fajr has attracted his attention, which he could by cl look calmly he, and throw away the fear irito those breasls who here the carelessness reigned. Those who fell this senseatjon of fear, could not explain from where it arose: somc attributed it to the dead grcy eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and to a glanc to pjerce throvgh the inw ard the functioning of the heart; but fell the chcek with a radius of charge that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, arid those who were busy t0 old excitement, and now fell the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in the presence of the hearty Ihair to engage their attention. Despite the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer hue, ej lher of the modesty blush os, or of the strong emoliori tob of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain hjs attentions, and to win, at least, some wbat marks that they might call affection: Lcldy Mercer, who had been the mockery of each in0nster She threw herself in her way, and she put everything on the robe of a mountain bank, to draw her attention: — Tbough in vclin: — when she stood before him, even if her eyes were apparently fixed on her, if it seemed that they were not perceived; — even her insurmountable impudence was bofflod, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not female lhat tbe sex was indifferent to him: however, so few knew that he was addressing himself t0 women. He had the reputation of winning the torigue; and even if it was beyond the fear of his singular character, or they were moved by his hatred of vice, he was also often among the women who cultivated the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young gcntlemclri named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was a left orphan wilh only one sister in the possession of great us alth, hy parents who died while he was still in childhood. Bequeathed also to himself by guardians, who said it their duty simply to take care of his fate, while TBey reljnquied the most important charge of his mind to the care of the mcrcenary svbalterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this romantic high foeling of honor on the candor, which every day destroys so many apprentices miIliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and said that vlce was lhrown iri by Providence meroly to serve the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that misery af a cottage mcrely c0nsisted in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, bvt that were adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various co1ourcd patches. At the end of the day, poets' dreams were the realities of the past. He was beautiful, frank, rich: f0r these reasons, when he entered the Gay Circle, many mothers surrounded him, trying to whicb should describe with the least truth that this languishing ar farce favorite: the girls at the same time, by their sparkling c0untenances when he approached, and by the sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he soon led him to nolions of his talents and merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was starred by the fjnding, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that flashed, riot swept away the presence of a ghost, but for lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these assemblies of pictvres and pleasant descriptors contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. By finding, however, compcnsotiori in his gratified vonlty, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above crossed his career.\nHe dumped him; and the unsuspecting vory of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hesolf, who gave few other figs of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to the existence of duothoir, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing the imagination to spice up anything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, hc soan formed this object in the hero of a novel, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, ratcr than Persian before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and he made a lot of advancod on his record, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were harassed, and soon sounded, from the notes of the preparatjon in—Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had only wmit his civriosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for hjm to perforate on the tour, that it was considered necessary for many gcnerations to allow young people to take a few quick stops in the service to capture an equivalence with age, and not to allow the hem to appear as falling from the sky, whenever scclndal intrigues are lied as subjects of pleasantness or praise, having the degree of competence to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mended his iristentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such an osteem mark of HLM, which apparently did not have in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to ridicule Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he has Fourid, that, although much more of his aetlons have been exposed to his point of view, the results strengthen the different confluences of the motives apparent in his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his group more than in 0ugh to relieve their immeasurable desires. But Aubrey did not refrain from pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he had given his alms; — these were sent from the daor with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve bis will, but to allow him to wall in his lust, 0r t flow even deeper in his lniqvity, he was sent with much wealth. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still unorthodox impressed on his mind: alI those on whom he was bcstowed, unshakeably his that there was o cursc on jl, for they were either led to tbescafffold, or sunk to the lowest splint the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the shadows through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the fashivable vices; there he entered the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, always attached with success, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he was even more so than he won it; bvt it was always with the same unshakeable face, wilb whicb he generally looked at the arovnd society: he did not, however, have his when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent strenuousness of the mind was set aside, arid his eyes sparked with more fire than that of the cat who deliated with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn the circle of srom that he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this proud; while many a father was sitting frantic, in the midst of talking about the silent hungry children, wjthout only one far from his immense end wealth, where with Huy even enough satisfy their present cravirig. However, he did not take money from the gclinbling table; but immediately lost, to many, the last gilder that he had just sriatchered from the candulsive take of the innocent: this mibbt but was the result of a certain degreek of knowledge, which was n0t, however, able to tame the curing of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begs him to castigate this charm and plea that proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own prosjt; — but he delayed it — for the same day, he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwclys the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and tbough Au hroy was near the object of his frillosity, he did not obtain more gratification of her than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exalted irnagination began to assume the apprehension of something supernatural.\nThey so0n arrived in Romc, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he allowed him to attend the morning circle of an Italian countess every day, as he went in search of the memorials of another almost decomposed city. Whjlst he was so engaged, letters arrived from England, whlcb he opened with the impatience ager; the first was from his sister, blowing nothing from the affection bvt; the other was from his guclrdians, the bim latler astoried; if he had previously entered the imagination bis lhal tbere wclsan ill being able to reside iri his companion, these seem to give him a sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his moro awkward habits dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for adultery had no origin in the hatred of his characleur; but that he had reciprocated, improved the hif gratification, that his victim, the partner of his vilt, had to be cast from tbe plnnacle of virtue vnsu1lied, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degrease: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, from his departure, even thrown the thc mask aside, and had not scrupulously to oxposo the quie deformity of their vices in the public eye.\nAubrey determined that by leaving one, the character of the pipe had not yet shown a single 0n breakpoint that rests on the eye. He resalved to invent a plausible prolext for the abandonment of jng hjin a1 together, purp0sing, in the mean, during, of the watob more closely, and to allow no slight circumstance to pass through non-dyed. He clasps himself in the same circle, and s0on percejved, that his Lordship strives to work in the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he has mainly frequnted. In Italy, it is rarely that an irritated femalo mingles with society; therefore be obliged to wear his plaris in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all the windings of hjs, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thought daughter. Having lost no time, he inherited Lord Ruthuen's apclrtment, and abruptly asked him for his wlth intentions to respect the Iady, informing him to the same lime that he was aware of his being about to meet her that same laugh. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that everyone would have had such an opportunity; and when asked if he had enlisted to marry, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired;\nTo say that from the moment of the battle it is necessary to refuse to accompany his hip iri lords the rest of their visit, he ordered his seraarit to sow other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informed boor of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The assignment was made. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not insinuate any suspicion of his plans unleashed by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey made his way to Greece, and passed through Pcninsula, soon to Athens. He fixed his residence in the huso of a Greek; and soon 0ccupie himself by tracing the erased records of the ancienant gl0ry on monuments which, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only b before slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many lichen oloured. Under the roof like himself, there existed a 6th, so beautiful and delicate, that she night bave formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on the carivass the promised hope of failure in Mabomet'f's paradise, except that tal her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she might belong to t0 those who had no souls. In dancing on the plain, or in tripping on the side of the innount, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanted her.\nthe eye, the eye of an animated nature, for this luxurious and sleepy look of animals, but for the taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquiljes, and 0ften would be the incorruptible girl, engaged in the pursvit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, to the ardour of him, who forgot the letter that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tab, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, if her braids fall, while she flitted arovnd, expose in the ray of the sun such deliciously bright and rapidly discoloring shades, he might well excufc the oblivion of antiquarian tbe, which let escape from the spirit of hjs the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passog in Pausariias. But why not describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without letting themselves be knocked down by crowded drawer pieces and stifljng balls. As he drew these remairis which he used to preserve a memorial for his future hovrs, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she then descrjbe to her circular dance on the open plain, painted, at hjm in all the brilliant colors of young memory, the wedding porn that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning to the subjects tbat hod obviously made a greater impression in her mind, would tell bim all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her kindness and apparent belief in what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years among her friends, and the dear bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful feinal to prolong her life for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he was trying to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe attached to her the names of old men, who had finally chosen one living among them, after many of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and she found him so unrepentant, she begged him to believe, for it had been, rernarked, that those who had dared to question the existence, had always had a given proof, which forced them, with grief and tear, to confess that it was true. She disdained him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, with a rather accruing description of Lord Ruthven; however, he continued to persuade, tal there could not be truth in the fears of ber, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that all lent to the excited belief in the supernotvral powor 0s Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling to Ianthe, his innocence, thus contrasting with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of love, wori his heclrt; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hats, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself even more and more attached to the almost magical form before bim. He would tear himself from her, and, forming the plan of cl if there were Ariquiquarian researches, he would go away, determined not to return until his object was maintained; 6but he always found it impossible to focus his attention on the theruins around him, while in his mind hc kept an image lhat soeded a1one the rightfvl possessor os his thoughts. Ianthe wos uriconscient of his love, and has always been the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed to leave him with relucency; but it was because she did not have any more with wbom shc that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy in the skelcbing or uncavering somo fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, arid they both, with several present, affirmed the existence of dujr, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, for he had to necessarily pass the wood of thro ugha, where no Greok would ever remain, after the closing of the day, until any c0nsideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the filthiest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey Madc of their representations, and tried to laugh thcin of the Idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so as to mock a superior, infernal p0wer, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey ended his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obsess the melancholy foce of his host, and was concerned that his words, flouting the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terror. Wben it was absolute of dopclrl, Iarithe came beside horses, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into office;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not see that the daylight was about to collapse, and that on the horizon there was one of the spccks' thoscs who, iri the warmer climates, gathered so quickly in a huge mass, and poured out all their rage on the devoted country.—He, however, finally mounted his horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these climates of soul, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the neighborhood begins: and it had already advanced far, the power of the abovc of the storm — its thunders failing had barely a resting interval — its thick and heavy raln forced others through the foliage of the cover, while the blue lightning of the fork seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Svddenly his horse got scared, and it was carried with terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found, by the light of the lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a cane-clt barely lifted if it came out of the masses of dead moats and brush that surrounded it. Demontririg, he approached, hoping to fry one for the gujde to the city, or at least relying on obtairi shclter of tbe pelting of the slorm. As he approached, the thunders, silent sor o mummerit, allowed HLM to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with mockery, with the exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound; — he was starred; but, excited by the thunder that snuck on his heel, he forced, with a sudden effort, the opening of the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not peried; sor, although he called, the sounds continued, no remark was confused with him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice shouted, \"Always floundered!\" He felt harassed by the one whose strength seemed superhuinari: determined to sell life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground tossed: — the enemy watered upon him, and kneeled in his chest, had placed his hands vpon bis thraat — when the glass of many tears penetrating through the hole lhat gclve light in the day, disturbed him; — he immediately rosc, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the bracbes, as he brokoed through the wood, was rio longer beard. The storm was riow stilI; arid Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the lhatch placed on any iridiudual straw with soot flakes. In the desire of Aubrey, they sought her who had drawn him up with her cries; he was again left in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torch burst again upon him, to perpetrate the aerial furnace of her beautiful eonducator brought into the corse without spot. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was a vision that emerged from his dislocated imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, tense by his side. There was a color na highori his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face which seemed almost as endearing as the life that the dwclt anone there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his thraat were marks of teeth having opened the vaccine: — to this men painted, weeping, simultaneously passed by horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A otter quickly formed, and Aubrey was a loid beside her who had lalely been the object of so many brilliant and magical vibes for him, now fallen with the flaw of life that had died in her. He did not know what the gypsies were — his mind was tainted and seemed to escape reflection, and to take a run in the vacanie — he said almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, wbich had found becn in the hut. They were quick to say a word about evenings of essays that got into the ark of her that a mother missed badly. Their lamentable cry, as Ihey approached the city, warned of a terrible disaster. \"To describe their grjef would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were insolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being pul to bod was seized of a very violent fever, and was o ften delusional; iri these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthuen and Ianthe — by an incalculable combination he seemed to be begging of his old currency to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, had the chance at this moment to arrive in Athens, and, of any matter whatsoever, at the hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hirinsels in the same hause, and became his constant ottendari. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whom he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rutbven, by his kirid words, insinuating the greatest repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and slill rnore by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to the presence of the hlf. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astute Aubrey; but also soori that bis c0nvalescence began to be fast, he withdrew again in the sclme state of mind, ond Aubreyperceived no difference from the former man, except sometimes tbat he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his 1ips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted hiin. With regard to the last stage of the Inualid, LordRuthveri was apparently committed to observing the tidal lbo waves raised by the cool breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the motionless sun;—irid, hc seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe ind of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, ond tbat elasticity of the mind wbich once had its distinguished now seems to have f1 forever. He was now as in love with madness and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wished, his thought could not find it in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought it in the midst of the rubbish which he had frangled before, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side—if he held it in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the midst of him, in the quest for the modest purple; then turning, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a mcck smile on his lips. He determined the scenes of the fly, of which each proueuro created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during the bis il Incss, that they shou1d visit the thoso parts of Greee and had not yet seen. They travel in all directions, and look for every place to which a memory could be attached: bul Although he hastened to go from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what he was looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these re ports, which they imagined to be only the invention of indelviduals, which they increst, it was to expel the generosity of tho that they defended prelude dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they traveled with only a few guards, more of your servc as gvids thari as a defense. On enteriririg, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the bone whicb was the taking of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had reasons to repaint their negligence; well fcarcely were the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were killed by the whistling of stakes near the head, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing them behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthuon and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a manna behind the bend sheltered from defilement: but hard to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, brie lhem advarice, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the rabers were to climb above and take them into roar, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in the shou1der, which crushed it down. Aubrey hastened to help him; arid, no longer taking into account the contest or his own poril, is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him, if guards hasten, if Lord Ruthven is wounded, immediately tossed his arms and surrenders.\nBy promising a great reward, Aubrey foon inducted tbem to transport his wounded friend t0 a nearby hut; and having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their preserice — they simply grumbled him until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had a scam. Lord Ruthven's strcngth declined rapidly; in two days the inortication followed, the arid date paid rapid steps. The oonduc and appearance had changed n0t; it also seemed unconscious of the pain that it was bad of the objeets ab0ut him: but towards the end of the last everiing, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, arid his after-eye fixed on Aubrey, which was induo to offer help hjs with more seriousness than usual—\"Sit me! You can save me—you can do more than that—I don't mean my life, I'm dying from my existence as little as the one of the day passing; but you can drink my horror, your friend'f honor. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey replied.—\"I would do anything. If you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my d eatb had been unknown for some time in Englari—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rasirig himself with an exultant uiolence, \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge beyond my crimes or death to any living binge, in any way whatsoever, or what you can see. \"His eyes fainted from their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he laughed on his plow, and no longer braided.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circumstances attended his acqveinance with this man arose on his mind, and he knew nat Why; when he remembered his oalh a chilling cold cclme abort him, as if the presenting of som ething horrble waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri that had been left the body, when cl Robher met him, and iriform hlm that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the pinacle of a nearby moon, according to a pr0mife that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed t0 The cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, dlermined to go and cook it on the wbere spot he rests. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the eorpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were pointing at the same stone thc on which they had laid the body. For some time he was dismayed by conjugations, but he eventually fell back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a c0vntry in which he had encountered terrible misfortunes svcb, and in wbich all closely conspired to raise superstitious melancholy thal who had grasped on his mind, he decided to leave her, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to pick him up at Otranto, or at Naples, he took care of the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other thirigs, there was a case containing 0f 0ffence severol weapons, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several clnd otaghan daggers. If he turned them and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the defamed dagger in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to get more pr0of, he found the wcapon, and hif h0rror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, although in special shape, the sheath he holds in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted to differentiate; but the particulate form, the same varying shades on the haft and the shoath were similar to the splendor on both, and left no room for serious doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his inquiries about the lady he had assimilated to Lord Ruthuen'f soductive arts snalch. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. The spirit of Aubrey bee almast brokon under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had not been victimized by the destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only the occupation consisted of exhorting at the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived in Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, so0n tossed him to the English sh0res; and hc hastened to the home of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appocled t0 lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory in the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she became even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon's assomblies. There was no bones that light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the evity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from the misfortune, but from a careful feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a c0nscious soul of a 6righler kingdom. His step was not so light, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was never filled with a smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection for him, and in his presence he would have forgotten those tears that she knew how to enslave his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that if these eyes,—the thclt's focus were then playirig in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, he had been thought by his guardians more fit for his presentation should be delayed after the return of his br0thor from the continent, wben he could be his protector. It was therefore resolved that the ncxt lounge, which was approaching quickly, should be the time when it entered the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have rathcr stayed in his fathers' house, and fed on melancholy whincb dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of osfashionnable strangers, when his mind was so torn apart hy the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon stopped in the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a dredging room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held so long, and all that was anxious to rest in the middle of the kingship, quickly thilher. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was flancing in an eorncr 6y himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the time fjrst that he had seen Lord Ruthven was at the lizard place — he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and cl voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear — \"Remember your oath.\" He had the hard courage to turn, afraid to see a spectre that blasl hjin, when he perceived, at a distance from litlle, the same figure that had drawn the attention of hjs to his place when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs came back almost to carry their weight, ho waf forced to take the arm of cl sriend, and forcing a passeclge through the erowd, he threw himself in his car, and was a home driver. He paoed the room with screaming steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid his washings would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath.—Hc woke up, he found the riot believing that he could — the dead rise again!—He thought that his evil imagination had conjured the image on which his mind rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for although he tried to ask conoerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succumb to obtaining informal Jon. He went some nightf aftercr with his fisher to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and there he gave himself to his devoring nostrils. When he finally saw that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he was moving. He went forward, seized the sister's arm, and, with a hurry, pressed her to the street: The door was pedalged by the crowd of servans waiting for their lords; and when he was engaged in the pafsing thcm, he again heard this voice whispering near him – \"Roinember yovr aath!\" – He dared not turn, but, pressed his sieve, soon arrived at home.\nAubrey has become the most difficult. If before his mind had been ahsorbed by a subject, how many inorcs was he completely eng-\nRosse, now, tbats the certainty of the monster's Iiving Agajn has pressed on the bis thoughts. Her sister's attentioris was no longer listened to, but in vain she intimidated her to explain to her the evil that caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more angry he was. His oath bewildered him; was it therefore permitted for this monster to wander, to sob upon his breath, to amjdst all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister vcry could have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed suspicions, who would believe it? He sought to use his own hand to free the world from misery; but death, he remembered, had been derisoryly mocked. For days he remained in this state; he rose up in his ro0m, saw no one, and bound only to sister bis, who, with tears, begged him, for her, to support nature. Finally, no longer carrying capablo bone calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from slreet to street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exafod in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned to the house in the evening; but at last he crushed him to rest where fatigue prevented him. His sister, proud for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pure-sugar reaper, far from everything. Its condual, however, slightly shook. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a fiend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he managed to enter society again, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a raom, his distrustful eyes were so striklrig, his inner shivers his visihle, his sister was obliged to Iast to beg him to abstairi to seek, for his false, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be little aavailirige, the guards thought they could intervene, and, fearing that his urid would be alienated, they spent a lot of time regaining the confidence that Aubrey's parents had previously imposed on the inside.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and eyebrows that he had encountered in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they oonsidered madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him const. He hardly seemed to notice, so that his mind was absolved by a terrible subject. His incoherence has finally become so great, that ho was consinated t0 hls cabarnber. There, he was often licencing for dcly, unable to be awakened. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affliction and reactivation was manifested at the entrance of his sisler; then he began sometimes, and, shaking his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, ho wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" He clinged again in a state, when she couldn't even wake him up. Thif lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his incohe-\nThe rences became less freckled, and his mind threw a p0rtion of his morosity, while his guardians served, that several tiines in the day he ran on his fingers a certain number, and theri smiled.\nThe tlme had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians inherited from his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of being Aubrey in such a terrible situation, that his sister would marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this brand af return iritellect, whose they feared it had been deprived, lhey mentions the name of tbe Earl os Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey merely pleaded, and astonished them again by expressing his intention to be present on the nuptials, and wishing to see his sieve. They didn't answer, but in a few miriutes his sistor was with him. He was apparently again capabilous to be affected by the influence of his love1y smjle; for he pressed her to his 6rest, and kisfed hcr plays, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to stand again alive to feelings of affectionori. He began to talk with all his warmth, and to co-rigralize it on his marriage with a person so diftinguitous for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his breasl; 0 Pening her, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had hit his lf so long. He split the portrait in a paroxysm af ragc, and trampled under his feet. Asking Bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbclrid, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grasping his hands, and looking at hcr with an exfresion frantio of Countrice, he made him swear that she would never marry this monster, for he — but could not advance — it seemed that this voice pleased him again to remember his oath — he suddenly turned around, Lord Ruthven approached him, but he saw no one. In the butimo the guards and the physicion, who had heard the whole tbe, and thought that it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and begged to delay the bul for a day. Tbey, attributing this to the madness they imagined having taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been truffled with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's health, he easily understood the cause; when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exvulsion and his picfulness could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this infermation. He hastened to the huff of his former currencyian, and, by a constant presence, clinged to the pride of great affection for the brother and to interest in his sate, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed;—could say to h0w, since one knows hor, his existence, had begun to seem terrifying preferably, if it was simply that ho could listen to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the eldest branch that fell to him in length, hc obtained an important emossery, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage tob, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to place the doy even before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor arid his guardians, tried to bribe the searchers, but in vain. Hc asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sieve, able him, as she valorizes her own happiness, her own honor, arid the horror of those who are now in the grave, who discovered her in their arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay 6ut for a few hours lhat marjage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servclnts promised that they would untie him; but by giving him the physician, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed 0n without rest to the 6usy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that can be easier than he conceived than described, tbe n0tos of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in frantic almosl. The curiosity of the servclnts of the last weircame their uigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the breath of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a related was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his elm by force, rushed him out of the room, without fear of fury. On the shelf, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oats and your kriow, except for my fiancée on a day-to-day basis, Yovr sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" He said, \"He threw him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek him.\" Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and it was passed on to the bod. Thls was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid to shake him.

Lord Ruthven had flirted, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYR0N RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nEN Sailing across the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 181z, we put in the port of Mityleno, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo and vegelclbles always your being there, encourage mclny British ships to visit it — the men of war and merohantmen; and although it is rather out of the rock for the ships bovnd to Smyrna, its premiums pay amply for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was used in the watering, and the sacriller was negotiating for the wild cattle, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble to the cave Homer's Sohool calie, and other places, wbere we had been before. Ori the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and erected a young Greek as our guide, who told us that hc had come from Scio witb an English lord, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his felvcca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" sajd lhe Grecca, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not dare leave Mitylene, where I am likely to be married. It was an addition, but a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in the shadow of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (aboul Lz50 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not consantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time in the house of thunder where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a silting lounge, and a bathroom, with an enclosed enclosed spaci0us. They were all decorated with siinples: hail walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain underneath, whlch could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a learing posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. There were half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library ompty: there were no mirrors, nor a single pclintlng. The bedroom had more a large maltress spread on the floor, with two colton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greeco. In the lounge wo observed a marble reves, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were lhen in a large marine chest in the cl0set: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. On the tablet, the pieces of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of Emplres de Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kolzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Last, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small brochures of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English crochet of any description. Most of these books were filled with notos mragjrial, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over, and marked with sheets of paper, on wbich were also romarks.\nThe old renan said: \"The Lord had been read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, he must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that I have been to move a thjng with orders, to be trodden upon me for a week; it is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm far away the problems of takirig care of it, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Armenianri who reside in a small house in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale.\"\nThe appearance of the outer dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty pac es long and fourteen wide, and the canned marble pillars with black pInthf and fret work cornices (as jt is now custom in Greek architecture,) were o0nsiderahly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light-stoned baustradc, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the house lops are furnished, as on them the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, dr enking light wines, such cls \"lachryrna christi\", eating frujt, and enj0ying the oven breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the hause, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and firsts gathered together on its edge, and under the shadow of two large 6ushes blueberries, a marble seat with a wooden back of 0rnamental was placed, on which we have wero-mold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nigbts until twelve hours, blushing, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" soud the old man, \"praying\" because he was very dovaut, \"and always went to our church twice a week, 6esides Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A line of rich valneyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle in flowers, and on the tho luminite whose ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesty lure. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. Tho fea smaoth in the form of glass, and a borizon not shaken by a single cloud, put the iew in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and pcllm-trees, small seural islands were observed distinctly, spreading the wave of light blue with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a moro vjow that I did not do tbis; but our requests were irrelevant as to the name of the porson who had resided in this romantic solild: no one knew his name but Domlnick, his banker, who had parked in Cclndia. \"The Armenian,\" cried our leader, \"could tcll, bvt I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you say, old frierid?\" he said, if I oeun,\" he said, \"I don't dare. We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned the sour details of the late lard. He had shared eight young girls when he wos lasted on the island, and even danccd with lhem at the wedding feast. He gave the cow cl to a man, the horses to the otbers, and the cotton and silk lo the girls who live by weaving these artlcles. He also bought a new boat for a fjsherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamenls to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, according to Oll whom we have collected, to have been a very eccntric character arid benevolence. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage, should be appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful mast daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left MityIenc's peaceful is; our imaginations all over the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. Hc looked obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all the eccentricities of thase whieh inark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, wbo traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, that you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trip to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at MityIene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Chllde Harolde\" being put in our hands we recognized the recluse 0f Calcla in the e vory page. We deeply regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted the rescue with the idea of returning to Milylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely insensitive, and in justice in the good name of its seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing to iri ari to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly matched from these lethal clnecdates. All the finest hearts of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their soot in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actors: his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a beirig on whose heart the Religion was bathed in its seal, and on whose head Bencvolence threw his mountain. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. We must always be careful, especially when it is directed again towards the moral integrity of man; and he dares to juft before this court awssul which must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a fellow-rnortal. Lord Byron's baracter is mean to his genius. Doing good in secret, ond escapes from the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Slreet.",
    "4": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Jahn William PoIjdori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, it does not extend to the Greek tho until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has usually taken its present form since the TB division of the churches of Lotin and Greeks; at the time wbich, the idea of becoming predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graces, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a few slight variations, to Hungary, Poland, Austria, on Lorralne, where the beIef existed, the tclt vampyres enjhthly soaked some of the blood of their victims, who had emancipated themselves, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumptions; while these human blood suckers became fatified — and tbeir velns became distended to take hold of a repletion stote, to cause the blood of all the passages of their bodies, and even of the p0res even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March, 732, is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particulate case of vampyrism, whooh is said to have occvrredat Madreyga, iri Hungary. He seems, that at the aris cxamination of the commander-iri-ohief and the magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affjrmed, lhot, aboul fivo years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vclmpyre, but had a way to get rid of evil, by eating part of the earth from the tomb of thc vclmpyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from taking a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and death, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made that the fov people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants of the village have consumed their Hadagni, taken the body, and found it (cls is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting clt mu, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A pole was piloted entirely through Arnold Paul's beauty and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he were bad alive. They cut off his head, buried his body, and threw the ash into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of these pe rsons who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should be American agents on the olhcrs who survived them.\nThe univerfal belief if, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hiin-self, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is redone, it seems better suited to illustrate the subjeot of the current observatjonf lhan any other likeness that could be produced. In many parls of Greece, death after the accident is considered to be a kind of punishment, an atrocious crime committed while he was in oxidence, that the deceased is not condemned to vampyria, but c0rnpeIlcd lo oonfinishes his infernal visits only to those beings whom he levates most while he is on the orth – those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the top, as Varnpyrus scint, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then terribly haunt the tbenative placo, and suck the tbe blood of all thy wreath; Tbere of the daughter Ly, sister, wife, about midnight drain the streom of 1 wife; yet take away the banquet that precedes thy livid living corsus, thy victims, be they expire, shall know the devil for their sire; as thou cursedst thyself, thou cursedest them, thy flowers shall be softened upon the stem. But ono that for your crime must fall, Theyorigest, beloved besl of all, Sball bless you with a father's riam—This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet you have your task and you mark the last tingling of his cheek: the last spark of the eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the non-alcoholic hand, the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest p1edge of affection has been worn—But now is carried by the Memorial of the tbine agony! Yel with your best hood will flow; Thygnashing tooth, and lip of the hook; Then hunting at your mud tomb, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits r ave, TilI these in horror shrink Fram moro cursed spectrum Ihan they.\nMr. Southey introduced als0 into his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalclba\", the vampyorse tbe of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having turned back brake tbe falls in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But he cannot be supposed to have been rosulted from the sin of his life, to have spread throughout the tale as a type of c0mplete of purity and innocence. The true Tournefortg gives an account in hif trclvels of seueral amazing cases of vainpyrism, for wbich that he claims to have been an eyowitness; and Calmet, in his green park on this subject, hates a variety of anecdotes, and narratives trodiliionaries illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, lending lo proof that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can only be concluded by remarks, that the Vampyre lerm is the one in the most general acceptance, thero are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: af Vruc0locha, Vclrdoulocha, Gou l, Brocolokcl, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, there appeared to several parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. Ho looked around bim, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the laughing light of the fair only obstructed his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into these unwise hreasls whoro rejgned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, attached to the core of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a single glance to pierce through the interior works to the heart; but fell on the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every dung; everyone began to see him, and tboso who had been accruing to the violent exoiteinent, and now felt weightless af boredom, wero happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although they are in shape and relief, many female hunters, after notoriety, tried to win her attentlons, and to win, at least, marks of sorno of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the wick of all the monsters she had in the drawing rooms, threw herself in her way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to stir up her opinion:—although in vain:—that she had stood before him, although her eyes were engulfed by her, still it seemed that they were not understood;—even her unapplied formudence was floundered, and left herself on the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet it was the spirit of apparent prudence that he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. Hehad, howeuer, the roputation of a winning language; and if it is even that it is surpassed the fear of its singular character, or that they mocked its apparent hatred of vice, it was also often among these women that lho boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as we clapp those who push it by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young gentleman named Aubrey arrived in Lond0n: he was an orphan left with a single sister iri the possession of a great sweath, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He also left 6y guardians himself, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortuno, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the guard of the Meroean superalternates, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and caridure, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thal vice was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, os wc seo in romances: he thought that the misery of a house simply consisted in the garment, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patohes. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were realistic life. It was beautiful, frank, rich arid: for these reasons, upan hls entering the jnto gay circles, the mary mothers circle hirn, striving that shouId describe with the least truth their languishlng or farfelu fovourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approaches, and 6y their sparkling eyes, when he contained bis lipf, soon led in false notiori his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romané of his solitary hours, he was surprised at the fjnding, lhat, except in the candles of wax clnd of tallow that licked, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundry in real life if there were none of the tbat congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he poorly formed his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, whose extraordinary being we have above describod, crossed blm in his caretaker.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hesels, which gave few other signs 0f his obscrvatiori of external objects, lhan tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by avoiding their contact: allowing his imaginaliori to imagine a greedy thing that flattered his prefenance to extravagant idecls, he soon formed this object inlo the hero of a romance, clnd determined t0 obscured the despring 0f bis fantasy, ralher that the person before him. He met with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced on his opinion, that his presence was still recogrified. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the knot of preparation in — Street, realized that he was eager to travel. Desiring to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, was only his curiosity, hchinted ta ses guclrdians, lbat jt was the time for him to make the tour, which for many genres was considered necessary to allow lbe yovng to take a few quick steps in the vice car to get on an equality with the elderly, arid not allowing them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of competence shewri in the pursuit of the latter. They agreed: and Au6rey, speaking of his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive a proposal to join him. Flammed by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accompanied him, and in a few days he had passed the surrounding waters.\nThat's right.\nrto, Aubrey had no bad opportunity os stvdying the character of Lord Rvthven, and n0w found, tbat, tugb many of his actions were exploded from his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not the indignation of the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms, that they sent out of the door with barely presumptuous sneezes; but when the prof1igclte came to ask som chjng, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Hiin to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away by ricb charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greater importuriity of the viciaus, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstance about the barbarity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for all the citrists were led to scaffolding, or sunk down and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent impatience his companion had towards the centres of a fashionable life; there he entered into the whole spirit of the farotable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but it was alwoys with the same unshakeable fato, with which he generally looked to tbe socjety around: he was not, however, so when the young novice eruption was encouraged, or the unlucky foetal of a numeral family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abscracy of the mind was set aside, and his eyes storped with more fire than that of food while delirling with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the formerly rich youth, and slept in the circle which he adorned, in the folly of a dungeon, the fclte which had drawn him into the corner of this fiend; while many other sot friantic, in the midst of the 1ooks speaking of mute hungry children, withovl o sirigle farthlng of his last immense wcalth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present cauring. But he did not take money from the gobbing table; bul immediately lost, to the roar of many, the last dorlot that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich was not, commentevcr, capble to forget the trick of the experienced mare. Avbrey often wanted to represent this to his sling, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleclesure wbjch proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own profit; — but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak to him deviously and openly; h0wever, thif never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his cartage, and in the midst of the various soenes rich in pearly, was always the same: hls eye spoke less tban his lip; clnd although Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain gratificati gratificati on it tban the conlonleous oxication to want vainly to break this mystery, which to hif exalt the hegan imagination to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey for a while lost sight of his companion; he let him delirium on the morning circle of an Italian countess, and he set himself in witchcraft of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, that he opened wilh eager for impatience; the first was his sisler, breathingnothhirig bul affeclion; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately leave his treats, and exhorted, that his character was draguedly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more serious to society. It had been discovered that his convulsion for adultery had not given rise to the hatred iri of his sbaracter; but that he required, for his gratification, that his vlctim, tho partner of his guilt, be cast into the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the abyss of the abyss and degradation: in flne, that all the women whom he had sought, adorning because of the virtue of the air, had, from his departure, cast the mask even aside, and had not burned to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a luminous point on which the eye rests. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purp0sing, jn the average whilc, to monitor it more closely, and lo do not let pass light circulavmstanccs without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly concerned with the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in sourt; but Aubrey's eye followed hjm in all its windings, and soon discouvrized that an assignment had been appointed, which wouild most likely ends in the ruin of an innocenl, though infallible daughter. Not wasting any time, he put on Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, insorbing him at the same time that he was awclre of his being about your meeting hor that very night. The Lord Ruthven was inflamed, that his intentions were such that he thought that the entrapment would have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry that he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey resumed; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fr0m that moment, he must refuse to include his Lordship in the reininder of their visit prop0sed, he ordered his servant to seize other apartmenls, and by calling the lady's mole, informed him of all that he knew, not only as regards the ber daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. Tbe Assjgnatiori has been warned. Lord Ruthven then merely indicted his servant not to consent to a separation, but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interp0sition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, soon f0und himself ol Atbens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the erased records of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, darkened by ehronjcling the deeds 0f freemen only in front of the slaves, hcld hid themselves despite the sheltering ground or a lot of col-\nOur lic hon. Under the same ro0s cls helpelf, there existed a being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she could have formed the model for a wjshing painter to rot on the canv-\nIn Mohammed's paradjse, except his eyes have spoken too much of mind for any 0ne to lhi nk It could belong to those who had no soul. By dancing on the plain, or by stumbling on the side of the mountain, one could have seen a bad type of his riches; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of nature set in motion, for this drowsy look of luxuriovs of the arimal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often acc0mpanied Aubrey in bis search aflater antiquilief, and often the girl vncconscivs, erigagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere bvtterfl there, would show all the beauty of its form, floating as it were on the wirid, tathe avid gaze of him, who forgot the milks which he just deciphered on a tablet aImost efface, in the contemplaliori of his figure of sylph. Often her braids would fall, as she wilted arourid, cxhibit in the ray of the sun tho so delicately shiny and swijftly discoloring the shades, he could well excuperate the forgelfu1ries of the antiquarian, which letescclpe from his mind the very object that he had before thought of the vital jmportance to tho properly interpret o passage in Pausanios. But why reach to describe the whicb charms all feel, but no cari appreciate?—It was innocent, yauth, and beauty, without being affected by ro0ms of ouawd drawing and stifling balls. As he drew these remains which he wanted to pass a memorial for his hours of fvture, he stood up, and woth thc magical effects of hif pencil, in traoing the scenes of his ncltive place; she would then describe to him the circle danc upori the open peain, painted, lo he in all the brilliant colors of young memoir y, the pompon of marriage, she would reminisce the look in his early childhood; and then, lunning to subjects which had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, caught up all the supremature tales of the nurse hcr. His fortune and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and 0ften, as she told bim the story of the living vampy, which hcld spent years amjdst his treats, the most dear arid bonds, forced each ycar, feeding on the life of a beautiful female to lie on her existence for the following mariths, his blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh his ol' bone so idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe was quoting the names o1d men, who had finally detected one living among the cmselvos, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked wilh the stamp of the appetite of the fiend'; and when she had found him so incredulous, she begged him to wear it, because he had 6th, pointed out, that lh0se wbo had dared their existence, so incredulously, confessed to him, that he had always girdled them, that he had no idea of it. She detailed to him the tradition of the Lhesian monsters, and her horr0r was incredulous, by Uririg a fairly precise endowment of Lord Ruthven; being, however, still persistent to persuade her, lhat thcrc could bo no lruth iri her fears, laughing at the same time that he wondered about many coincidences that tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and to cling to Ianthe; his innocent, therefore c0ntrasted with all the offecles virtues of the women among whom he had sought f0r hjs vision of romance, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englisb hahits, marrying ari without instruction Greek girl, he found himself even more and bitten attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped himself apart, and, forming a plan for some anti-quarjanic research, he left, determined not to return until his object was set on fire; but to be always faltered he impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an imogue which seemed to alono the rightful owner of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was still the same infanli1e bejng that he had known for the first time. She always noticed to separate from him with reticence; but he was guessed that she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite heavings, while her tutor was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had yet escaped from timo's destructiue hand. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and the two, wilh several present, affirmed their existence, the horror of the pale spirit to his very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they seized the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, for he had to go through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the station of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path of the Jr. Aubrey made light representations, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; 6and when he saw Lhern trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silting.\nNexl morning Aubrey set 0ff von son exo-\nthe ursion without surveillance; hc was surprised to observe the melancholy face of hjs bost, and was worried that his words, by chewing the 6th elief of these steep hisns, had irritated them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Iarithe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to take revenge, and the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action; — he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the harison there was a spot of tbose that, in the warmer climcltes, quickly gathcr irito s0 a huge mass, and pour all their rage over the devoted country.—He, however, mounted his horse, determinod to catch up with his sar his delay: but he wos too lato. The twilight, in these southern peaks, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and there ho had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely an interv al of rest — its rain hea vy forced his way through the making of the canopy, while the forked lightning blve seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and was carried with rapid dreadsul through the covered forest. Finally, the animal stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brvshwood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least rely on getting shelter from the storm. As he approached, the thurders, for a silent moment, heard him hear the cries of a woman who mingled with him, mocked an exulting laughter, conlinuating one of the almost intact sounds; — he was surprised; but, awakened by the bumblebee that Agalri was rolling on his announcement, he, with a sudden effort, in front of the door of the hut. He found the total darkness of hjmself iri: the soin d, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, the sounds were still inoperative, and no opinion was lacustrine of bim. Hc sounded in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a voyoe shouted, \"Always mocked!\", to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt harassed by him whose strong man seemed to be pulsating: dissuaded from selling his life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was listed with his feet and threw the force on the ground enormously; – his enemy threw himself up to the height of the hlm, and threw himself on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat – when the brightness of many torchos penetrated by the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him; – he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the stretcher of the branches, as he broke the wood, wos no 1onger heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, and the light of their torches was poured out on the mud walls, and the stubble spread over all straw with hcavy soot flakes. To the desire of Aubrey Thoy lay down for her who had clinged to him by his cries; he was agonized left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again 6urst on bim, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful condress brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an arisirig vision of the distracted imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cbeek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence in his face that saw almost as attached as the life that once lived in Tbere: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his root were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pojnted, crying, simultaneously struck the horror wilh, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the slender of her who had recently bred to him the objcct of so many brilliant and magical vlsians, now salooned with the flower of life that hod died in her. He did not know what he thought — if the mnd was eaten up and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in a vacaricia — he diligently unconsciously in his hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, whieh had been found in the hut. They soon met by different parties who were six years old in fear of the ber that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as Thcy approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describing their cries would be impassable; bul when they determined the cause of their child's affair, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were inconsolclblc; bollh diod broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called the Lord Rvthven and on Ianthe – by a uriaccolunable combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chonched at this time t0 arrives in Athens, and, from the wbotever motive, on the assumption of the state of Aubrey, immcdiateIy pilaced himself in the same house, and incarnates his constant servant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified arid astonished at the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had causod tbeir separation, and even more by the attention, the connectedness, and the care that he showed, soon reconciated to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalence began to be rapid, he gradually rotated the same state of mirid again, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, excepling that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, with a smile of insulting exultation jng on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted hmm. During the final stage of the re-establishment of the invillid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the infallible waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, or to marking the progros of the tbose orbs, encircled, like our world, the lost moving sun;—he seemed to fight to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elaslicity of the mind that had 0ne so distiriguishod it riow seemed to run away never sore. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; 6t as long as he wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he was sought in the midst of his ruins which he had previously frequented, the form of Iclnthe stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods of Tbe, a lighter step would seem to sow the wood water, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly would turn around, show his imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He has determined to steal scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed lo Lord Ruthven, to whom hc was held unpunished by the tender care he had taken of him during the illness, while they should visit the parts of Greece neithcr still had séon. They traveled in all directions, and looked for each place to cling to the recolletion; but although they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at at above. Thcy heard muoh os r0bbers, but they gradually began to seize these relationships, whereas imagination was only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the genorosity of lhose that they defended against the preconceived dangers. As a result, 0f neglecting the advice of lho habitarits, once they crossed with 0nly a few gvards, m0re to serve as guides as defense. Upon entering, Howeuer, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, where great masfes of rocks descended from the neighboring precipioes, they had reason to repent of their negligentco; for scclrcly were all the pclrty engaged in the narrow collar, that they were started by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo roport of several guris. In an instant, the guards had left them, and, standing behind the rock, had begun to fire in the direction from which the reporl came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, withdrew for a moment behind the turn of the defilement of Tobe: 6th shameful to be shot down by an enemy, who, insultingly, shouted in advance, and being exposed to slavery without resistance, if the Ari of the thieves were to cling over and take in the back, they immediately decided to rush into the witch of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubroy hastened to rush into his asphyxiation; and, no longer listening to the peril of the challenger, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around Bim, his guards having, on Lord Rulhven's beirig, immediately cast their arms and handed over.\nBy the promises of a great raid, Aubrcy soon pushed them to transport wounded people to a nearby cabin; and, having combined on a rans0m, they were no longer disturbed by their presence — they were content with it. Keep the entrance until their comrod returns with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His arid conduct had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but to say the olose of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and the bis eye often fixed on Aubrey, who wos endured with the help of his help with more than the usual fortune—\"Help me! I don't mean my life, I didn't listen to the decline of my existence like the one of the passing day, but you can save your friend's honor. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I could have done anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but few things — my life flourishes — I can explain everything — but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was the free mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exvlntantvi0lcnc, \"Smile with all your soul resent, with all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crjmos or death to any bining living in any misfortune, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I made swcar!\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing on the pillow of hjs, and he no longer breathed.\nAuhreyrelired lo rest, but did not sigh; the many circumstances that saw his knowledge with man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his almond, a cold shiver came upon him, as is of lhc presontiment os s0mething horrific waiting for him. He was about to seize the body, when a thief took him away and informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been transported by himself and by comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a pr0mise thcy who had given his seigneury, that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon, the lhat rose after his death. Aubrey deafened himself, and takirig several af the men, determined to go and bury on the place where he was. But when he got into the smoke, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were pointing the same stone at what they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake cc ciothes.\nWeary of an iri country that hc had met with such terrible mistakes, and in wbich all appearedryly conspired to increase this superstitious melarichoIy who had grasped the mind, he decided to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to send him to Otranta or Napies, he took care to organize with him the effects that belonged to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case that contaminates several weapons of crime, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his overprice to sindjng a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as tbe daguerdovcred in the hut of fatcll — he shuddered — hastened to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, ond hjs harror can be imagined when he discovered that he corresponded, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a furthcr certainty; he seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; however, he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same shade shades on the hafl and the sheath were also in splendor on both, and loft no place for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, his first jnquiries checked the lady he had tried to capture Lord Ruthuen's seductive arts. Her parents were in distros, their fortvne was rolling, and she had not been listening since the departure of her seigneury. Avbrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been victimized by the destroyer of Iarithe. He bocame morose and silent; and his only job was to vrger the postiliori speed of tobe, as if he were glng to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Ca1ajs; a breeze, wbich, seemed to obey his will, soon swayed him on the banks of the Englsh; and he hclslcn at the house of his fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all memory of the leg. If previously, through her infantile carcasses, she had gained her affection, now that the 6egan woman appeared, shc was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowdcd apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the brieath spirit. There was a melancholy eharin abo ut it that did not seem lo emerge from miffortune, but srom a certain feeling inside, which set you in motion indicates a conscious soul of a brigbter kingdom. His step was not such as the foot, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. Alone, his face was never dazzled 6y with the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection, and wanted in his presence to forget tbose deuils She knew he had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the volvptvclry? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eight years old, and had not been introduced to the world, that is, she had thought by the guards that her presentatlon should be delayed from the return of her brother from the continent, while he could be his protector. It was now, lheresore, solved lhat the next salon, whob was fast appraachrig, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse sawmill.\" Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the mansian of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that had overturned him. He could not feel interested in the frivolous fashioned strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own o0mfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, the whieh having made himself boen anri0unced like a living room.\nThe c rowd was an excess of jve – a draw-rooin had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a corner near him, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the recollection that, the first time he had seen Lord Ru thven wos in that same place, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would blow HLM up, when he picturing, a little distance away, the same figure who had struck his opinion on the spot when he first entered the company. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a sling, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fjxed his hands on his head, if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of the hjs brain. Lord Ruthven even before hiin—circumstances stifled ln arroy terrible—the dagger—his oath.—He woke up, he does not believe that possible—the dead are still rising!—He thought his imagination had corijed the imagc on which his mind rested. It was impossible that it could be real—he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few laughs after with his sisler to the assembly os anear relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he bound himself into a reef, and there he gave himself to his own devo...\nSounds like thoughts. Pereeiving, last clt, that many were on the run, he woke up, and entering another room, found the sister hjs surrounded by SeveraI, appears in serious conversatiori; he always had the intention to pass and approach her, when the one, who he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him those traits that he ranst aborrcd. He went forward, shook the sister's arm, and, with a whiff, forced her to the street; and at the door he found himself in a bliss1f with the crowd of swindlers fleeing for their lords; and while he was engaged by passing them, he held back the voice which drew near to him: «Remember your oath!»\"He dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, soon carried.\nAubrey has become very disconcerted. If before his mind was absorbed 6y a subject, how much moro completely he was absorbed, naw that the certainty of the life of the monfter has pressed again on his floggings. His sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in Valn that Sbe instructed him to explain to him what had coincided with his abrupt conduct. He spoke a few words, and those who were terrified. The more hc there is, the more he goes astray. His oath surprised HLM;—washe tuna to allow this monster to wander, carrying rujn over his breath, in the midst of all that he held, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his sister was touched by him. But even if he went to break his oath, and to decipher his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the wor1d from such a wretched; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For dayf ho was born again in this stote; locked in his room, he saw rio one, and ate only when his sister camo, who, with tears flowing from the eyes, begged Hiin, for his own good, to support the natvre. Finally, it is no longer easy to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, beaten with street lo street, anxi0us to steal this image that flouted him. His dress becomes neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to mid-day svn as to the humidity of the night. He was no longer recognized; at the fjrst he came back with the evening house; but to lclsthe he laid him down to roam wherever fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to flank him; but they soon became distracted by him who fled from a runaway purfy more than any thought. His driver, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he had left him by his whole absencc friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into the sawhood, and to watch him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached the intimacy wilh. Bul, when he entered a room, his discontented and hagnar eyes were so striking, hjs inward so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, hawever, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the tang ht guards were fit to intervene, and, fearing that tal his mind was becoming alienated, they thought that it was high to resume that trust which was bad before imposed by Aubrey's parerits.\nDespered to save him from the evils and sufferings which he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor to reside in the house of Tbe, and took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, s0 completely was his mirid absarbed by a terrible subject. His jncoherence became to lasl so great, that he was confined to his room. There, he would lie for days, inconsistent to be awake. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier; — the only figure of the defection and of the remaining memory appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near HLM!\" When, however, she asked whom hc roferred, her only ancrwas, \"True! True!\" And again he sank a slate lnto, from which even she could rause hlin. Thjs 1 makes it easy for a lot of months: gradually, as the year passes, his incoherencos become less frequent, and his mind shakes a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observe, that several times in the day, he counts on his fingers a defined numbor, then smiles.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the day of the year, one of his gvclrdians inherited from his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a horrible situatjon, when if sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this reverent intellect brand, which they feared had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be prescnt with the nuptials, and eager to see his sisler. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. It seems that Hewaf was again affected by the influence of his first smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed the cheek, wet with tears, slowing down to the thought that his brother was once alive with feelings of affection. Ho began to speak with all his warmth and to congratulate her on her marriago with so distinguished a person for her rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on her chest; when he leaned on her, what was his surprise at looking at the features of this monster who so badly influenced his life. He grabbed the portrclit in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture husband, to be looked at as if he did not understand her, then to grasp her hands, and to look upon her a frantic expression of cauntenance, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monfter, for being—but he could not advance—it seemed that this voice again signaled to her of his faith—he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was neor but saw no one. Meanwhile, the gvardions and the doctor, who had entire hcard thc, and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered, forcing the fram Mifs Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He sold them on his stuff, and begged them to put an end to it, but for a day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, had taken possession of his spirit, closed down to pacify it, and connected.\nLard Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with each eIse. When he heard of the evil beauty of Aubrey, he understood perfectly that it was he who was the object of it; but when he learned that he had been denied, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be extracted from those who were among him, he obtained this innocent orman. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by a hard presence, and the pretened of great affection to brotber arid intcresl in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who can resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to retract – could speak of hjmself as an individual who had no sympathy for being ari on the overcrowded earth, except with the ber to whom he addressed himself;— could say how, as he knew her, his existence, had hegun to appear wrly of prcservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing acolytes;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or so badly the will of destiny, that he won his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large cambe, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed stote of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the coritinent.\nAubre there, when he was left by Tobe physiclan and his guardians, tried to bribe his servants, but in vain. He asked for the pcn and the paper; it was given to him; either wrole a letter to his sister, wounding her, as she waved her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of thase now in the grave, which once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the house to be dull, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to hold Miss Aubrey by, what he cnsidered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rcst to the occupied inmates of the house; and Au6rey heard, with a horror that can be easier to conceive than deerbite, notes tbo of busy preparation. M0rning came, on the sound of the wagons af broke on his ear. Auhrey grew almost frontal. The curiosity of the servants, at last, their vigilance, they flew away gradually, leaving the hive in the cuslodie of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with orie bovnd was 0ut of the coin, and in a moment was found in tbe apartmenl that it was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm hy force, rushed him into his room, furious without a voice. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if you are not engaged, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" Sighing, he pushed blm to his entourage, which, awakened by the old woman, had come to the sea of him. Aubrey no longer supported himself; his rage, which was not a vent, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not prosent when he entered, as the doctor feared to shake him. The marriage was salted, and tbebride and hridegraom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces TB symptoms near the approach to death. Hc wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he told in a composite way what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened Miss Aubrey's protection; but when they stopped, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, on Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nCAC-\nAMOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON, &o.\n\"The world attends him all, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of its majestic ships, in the year 1812, wo placed in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this region, and the supply of certaln of cattle and vegetables that must always be there, lead many Britjsh vesfels to visit it — 6oth men of war and merchanlmen; and although there is rather 0t of the way for the boats baund to Smyrna, his bountief largely reimburse for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the boot of hay, and while the rncn was used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble at the cave Homer's school, and other placcs, where we were before. On the front of Mourit Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, wbo left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld took me with bim; but I did not dare leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get marricd. He was a strange man, 6 on a very good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, is consecrated to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gclve Dominick, the merchant of Winc, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in hif felucca very delen to the various islands.\"\nThis story excited our curiosity very much, and we did not waste time hastening into the house where our compatriot had retired. We were kindly received by the old man who cast us over the mansion. It can accommodate four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting living room, and a bed-restaurant, with a spacious arinexed wardrobe. They were all decorated with siinples: light green walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the inner part, and a small founlain below, which could be crazy to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small Verius bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed tho furn-\nSure. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library ompty: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. Thc's bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the common bed through 0ut Grecce. In the living room, we obferved a marble niche, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor's chest in the closet: it was open, bul we have not had the ink noseeues justified iri cxclmining eonents. On the tablet of the recess are the works of Voltaire, Shakespearo, Boileau and Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerinan, in the German language, the Messiah of Klopstock, the riovcls of Kolzebue, the play of Schiller des Robbers, the Paradise Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810, several small pamplets of the Greek press at ConstontinopIc, very torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itolian and Latiri. The Messioh literally wrote the whole ovcr, and it was marked with sheets of paper, on which there was also remorse.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books before he left, and he forgot to place others; but, he said, he must lie until his return; for he is so special, that if I moved an unordered lh, he would frown me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. Once I made him a fervice; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, excopt twenty zechins which I pay to an old Armerian who resides in the small house in the wood, and who brings the Lord Brugbt here from Adrianople; I do not know why reasori.\"\nThe Tho appearance of the externcllly house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps lorig and fourteen hroad, and the canned marble pillars with biack p1inthes and f ret-w0rk cornices, (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were curidaly higher than the roof of lbe. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wcls covered with a fine Turkish earpiece, brieath an awnirig linen strong coarfe. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them the Greeks have their evenings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrlsti\", eating fruit, and joining the evening breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, first arid oranges gathering on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental waaden baek, on which we were told, the Iord spent many of his evenings and nights until Twe1 hour, reading, the scribe, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always ottensified a wcek twice, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A linen of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, and on the top of which a Greek lempet was destroyed appeared in a majestic lure. A small stretcher moves away from the ruins of Tbe des cndred in broken cafcades, until it is Iost in the woods near the base of the m0untain. The sea smooth as glass, and a harizon vnshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the Ift, through a view of high chesnul and palm trees, several sinall jslands carried distinctly observed, pulling out the blue wave ljght with spots of emerald green. I had a more beautiful view than what I did; but our enqviries were without fioriture as the name of Tbe who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name but Damjnick, his bariker, wbo had gone to C andia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you, old friend?\" said I, \"if I can,\" I said, \"I won't dare.\" Wo didn't have any lime to visit the Armenian, bvt on ovr back in the city we learned the sovereign details of the isolated lord. He had a portioncd eight young girls that he was the last on the ifland, and even danced with them at tbe nuptial seast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who lived by weaving these itemsf. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in o gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, ho appeared to us, from a1l we collocated, to havc beon cl character very occentric and benevolent. We have learned that our former friend at the cottage has thought nol is capable of diselising. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had made him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use it.\nSucb was the information with which we moved away from the island of the peace of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the grid, guessing who this ramblerin G reece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philanthropy of dispositian, arid arid these eccentricities that mark peculjar gonius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in camp with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a WYATT'S pvpil, who had traveled to Egypt and Greeco, \"Individual TB,\" he said, \"about what you are so anxious about, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We did not have The glory of his seigneury, as we had done a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calea's recluse on the same page. We deeply regret not having been more curious in our research on the hillside, but we have comforted ourselves with the return of ldea os to Mitylene ori on a future day; but to me that day will come again. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of her seigneury, which has been severely slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as we can fully see from these little anecdotes. All the sons of the ear, so elegantly represented in the pooms of his seigneury, seem to have their seat jn his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and tenacity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of the sovilude, if an additional reserve to mark him as a being on which the Religion sealed his heart, and above which the head of Benev0lence threw the mantle. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as her 1 oves orpleafures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opiriion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a horrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrere-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rlhy of his genius. To make the right secret, it is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eourt, Fleet-stroet.",
    "5": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tclle is based is very general in the East. That's what we have to do. It seems common to the Arabs: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed only the present form of the jts since the division of the Latin and Greek bears; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a body of Latln could not be corrupted if it were hurdled on their territory, it gradually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from the tombs of Tobeir, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful Tbe. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the uampyres were imbating a certain part of the burden of the victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, ond specdlly died of consumption; while these bvman suckers were greasing — and their veins became distended such a state of repletion, so that the blood flowed all the passages of their body, and even of the poref of their skins.\nIn the Journal Londori of March 1732, is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is declared at hclve oecurred in Modreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an oxaminotion of the commander-in-chief and justices of the peace, they were defeated positively and unanimously, tbat, about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had bcen tormented by a vampy, hut had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing bimsels with lime blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming himself cl vampy; for, abovt twenty or thirty days swollen his date and burial, mony people complain of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other mjschicf, the incapacitants having Cansuit their Hadagni, took the odyb, and found it (as is supposed to be usuaI in vampyrism casf) fresh, and enjrely free fr0m corruption, and emitting clt mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. The evidence was thus obtained, they resorted to the clccuftome remedy. A stake was led entirely through the heart and body 0f Arnold Paul, where either Js would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same mcasures were adapted with the corsef 0f the prsoris who had preui0usly died srom vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, the bee agent on others who survived them.\nThe universal beliof is, that a person fucked hy a vampyre becomes a go mpyre himself, and svcks in turn.\nChief Hcliliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it is adapted to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other forum that may be presented. In many Greek priests it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his infested visits only to those beings who loved most on earth, those they were bound by kinship and affection.\nBut first upon the earth, as Vompyre sent him, Tby Corsica will be praised from the thamb; then haunt the land of birth, and suck the blood of all thy rèe; there of thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the flow of life; And yet take away the bank that performs Muft will feed thy corse livid llvjng, Your uictims, are still exhaled, Sball knows the devil for their sire; As you cursed, you cursed them, Your turrets aro flied on the stem. But Orie that for your crime must fall, The young man, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father—This word will wrap your bcart in flames! Yet you must put an end to your arid task marks the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see what freezes o'er they unvivable blue; then wilb unhal1owod hand will tear Thc braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when the thorn of Affilon was carried the promise — But now is 6orne away from you Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your grinning tooth, and your hook's lip; and then groaning at your mud tomb, go, and make Gouls and Afrits gratify, until those who are in horror go away from the cursed thing than tobey.\nMr. Southey also iritroducod in his wld but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having reborn fr0m the grave with the aim of tormentingjnghirn that she loved better when in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resisted the sinneress of her life, she has 6th pivorta loudly the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for whieh he claims to have been an eyewitness cln; and Calmct, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of clneodotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added;\nThis is a question that arises in the context of the analysis of developments in the situation and developments in the world.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, we appeared here to several parties of the leaders, if the tori was a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than for its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fcler attracted only his atlentiori, only poisoning by a glance stifles him, and casts fear into those breasls where the gypsy reigned. Thofe, who felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where Jt arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the objoct, did not seem to penetrate, and to a glaneeto pierce throvgh to the iriword workers of the heclrt; but feil on the cbcek with cl ray tbat weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be irritated in every house; all wanted to see him, and those who were used to violence excitedly, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have somcthing in their oapable presence engaging their attention. In spite of the emotion of passion, which has never gained a warmer tint, eitber fred the blush of modesty, or of this strong emotion of passion, the farm and the beautiful wcre contours, mary of the hunter after notoriety tentod to gain her attentions, and to win, at the leost, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, wbo had been the mockery of monster of urery worn in the drawing rooms slnee her marjage, threw himself in his way, and did everything except put on the dress bone a montebank, to attract his attention:—thougb in vain:—when she stood before him, her eyes were apparently fixed upward, he ignited as if they were not seen;—had her incomprehension been flouted, and she left the field. But common adultery could not influence the ovon the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the feinal sex was indifferent to him; but this was the apparent cavtion with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent donut, that few ever knew that he addressed himself to women. However, he had the reputation of having a winning language; and even if he had overcome the fear of his singular character, or were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was often cles among the women who make up the thc boast of the sex of their mestic virtues, as among the thofes who push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time, he carne in London a young gentleman of Aubrey's nclme: to be an orpban left with a single sister in possession of Greeklt weallh, by parents who died while he was still jn childhood. He was also left to himself by guards, who so much so that they took due care only of his fortune, while they reinquised the greater charge of his urid in the custody of the subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imaginationjon more than his iudgmenl. He had, hencc, this high sense of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so many apprentices. They kept on sympathizing with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown away by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the rnifery of a cottage consisted simply in the unveiling of eliothes, which were so warm, but which were more suited to the eye of the painter by their irregu1ar folds and their vorl0us colored patbes. He thought, very well, that the dreams of the ponies were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay circles, many demobers surrounded him, slivring who shoed to describe with the least truth their languishing or crawling favorites: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating counlenones when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when ho opened his lips, he soon made him pass in false nolons of his talents and merjt. Attached as he was the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the suif clnd candles of thal clickered wax, not of the prosence of a gbost, but srom lacks snuffing, tbere was not a real jri foundation lisé for ariy of these congreries of pleclishing images and descriptions contained in these volumes, of whooh he had formed the study hif. However, by finding some compensation jn bis gratis vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when 6 extraordinary years ago we saw above, the crosfed in the career of hjs.\nHe walchod bim; and the very inconceivable to form an idca the character of a man entirely abs0rbed in hiinself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, lhcln the tacit agreement to existence, implicitly by the avoidance of the contact of tbeir: allowing his jmagination to imagine everything that flattered his prapensity to extravagant ideas, hesoon formed this objoct in tbe hero of a r0mclnce, and determined to obsess the progeny of fantasy hif, rather than the person before him. He met with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced on his opinion, that his presence was still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rvthven's afsairs were taken, and soon Fovnd snored the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was clboul lo traveI. Desiring to obtain the information of mind concerning this singular character, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to persorve love, which, for many generations, has been deemed necessary to emerge young people to take a few quick steps in the caroeur of vice to be pounded on an equality with agony, and not to lower them to apparer as if fa1len in the sky, when above seanal0us intrigues cre mentioned as subects of pleasure or praise, according to the degree of competence sbewn iri corrupting them on. They consented: the young Aubrey immediately, speaking to Lord Ruthven about his intentions, was surprised to rejoice at a proposal from him. Flattened by Suoh a mark of Hiin's esteem, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the water of circ1ing.\nHitberto, Aubrey had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in liberality; — idleness, vagaond, and boggar, reappeared from his hand more tharienovgh to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey could not auoid notice, that he was not virtuous vpon tbe, repulsed to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him even upori virtue, which he granted his alms;—these were sent fred the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate oame asked homebing, not to relieve his desires, but to allow het0 mur0w in his lust, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. It was, howeuer, attributed by him to the greatest importunity os tbe vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was fatill more impresfed on his mind: all those on whom he was stored, inevitably found that t here was a curse on jt, so they were all led to the scasfold, or sunk to the law and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Avbrey was surprised at the apparent agemess with which the companion bis sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; one entered into all the spjrit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known was his antagonlst, ond then he lost even more than he was going; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he generally looked at the arorid society: it was not, Howevor, so when he encountered the young novice eruption, or sat down without luck from a great family; then his very wifh seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent obstroctity of the mind was set aside, on his eyes sparks more sire tuna than from bed while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In addition, he left the old rich youth, Tom from the circle that he adorned, cursirig, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of tbis siend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, witb0ut o only farthing of his last immense wealth, whcrcwith t0 buy even sufficient lo satisfy their precdent desire. But he has no money from the table; but immediately lost, to McLny's ruiner, the last gi1der that he had just pulled from frorn the convulsive apprehension of the innocent: thls could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commentevor, capable of c0m6ati ng the cvnrianing of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and beg him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and does not tend to his own profi...\nt;—but he delayed him—for every day ho hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly arid to him; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenques, always finds the same thing: his eye spoke less than his limb; and tangb Aubrcy was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained n0 more gratjfication than the constant excitement of vainly wanting to break this mystery, which at his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something fupernclural.\nTbey soon arrived on Romc, and Aubrey spent time lost sight of his companion; he left bim in presence every day on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was committing himself in this way, letters came from England, which was plagued by ardent impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; others were inflamed by his guardian, the latter surprised him; if he had already penetrated into his tal imagination there was an evil power redoubted his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he leave his friend enigmaticly, and exhorted, by his character, the victims horrendously, so that the possession of the irresistible powers of seduction, would make his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had been covered, tal his contempt for the adultery hod not oujginné in the hatred of his baracter; but that he had demanded, t0 strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinnacle of the vnsueed virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women of the bone whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and had not scrupulously to expose the deformity of the tbeirvices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined up to 0n to leave the orie, of which eharaeter had not yet shown a single luminous point on whicb to refute the oye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, purges, in the sense, more closely, and not to let pass any circumstance of flight. Hc entered int0 tbe samc circlo, and soon perceivcd, that bis Lordship was trying to sow the inexperience of the little lady wbose hause hc cbiefly frequened. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmingled woman is encountered in society; so he was obliged to pursue the plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye trampled him in all his windings, arid s0on discovcred that a wrong assignment was designated, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though unfinished. Not wasting time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and bim abruptly dared his intentions with refect to the lady, insorting him at the same tmc tbat, he was awore of his beirig clbout to meet his thclt for a very long time. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that he believed that all the wovlds had an opportunity on svch; and after being in a hurry that he clinged to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, unequivocally writing a note, los say, that from then on he must dooline accompany bis Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seek you othcr opartments, arid calling the lady's mother, informed him of a1l il kncw, not only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the character of his Lordship. The award was avoided. The next day, Lord Rutbven merely indicted his fervour to nullify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion that bis plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's intolerance.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubroy directed his slcps to Greece and crossed the Peninsula. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the regs faded from gIory clnoient on monuments which, apparently, shameful to cbranicate the acts of free men only besieged slaves, had hidden in themselves sheriath the sheltering ground or coloured mony lichon. Under the roof of the Sarna, there existed a being, so beautiful and so delicate, that she could have formed the model of a peeriter who wanted to pour on canvases the promised hope of the paradise of false ln Mohammed, except that his eye spoke a lot of spirit for someone to think that she could dive to thoso who has no souls. As she danced on the set, or stumbled along the side of Movntclin, one could have bought from the gazelle a bad type of her peat; for who would have exchanged his eye, app-\nthe eye of the unimagined nature, for this look of luxuriovs sleeping with animal tbe adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe oflen accompanied Avbrey in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, erected in the pursuil of a kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, flating as he was vpont the wlnd, to the greedy gaze of him, wbo forgotten the Ictères which he had jufted on a tablet of almoft efsaced, in contemplation of his figure sylph-liko. Otteri would be her trolling braids, cls sho flitted around, exposing in the rose of the sun so delicately shined and swif-\nHe might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian tbe, who let escape from his mind the obiect even he had before thinking of the vile importance for the appropriate interpreter of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no cari appreciato?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stlflirig balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, shc wovld stood by, and looked at the maglc effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of his native plagiarism; she would then describe to him the dance encircled on the peain operiphery, would extend to him, in all the brilliant colors of the memory of Youthfu1, the marriage pump that she remembered in her machine; then, turning the tbat subjects had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her bitterness and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the euen interest of Aubrey; and 0ften as shc told her the story of the living vampy, which had pafed years in the midst of her friends, and the loves, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to bring her out of so many idle and horrible fantasies; bul Iantho quoted the names of the old men, who had forgotten for the last time a living between them, after the severol of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of the thofie; and when she found him so inord, she waved with bim to lighten him, for it had been noticed that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had a proof, which forced him to tbem, of mind, and heart, to confess to it. She detailed to him the appearance of these monsters, her horror was incracked, hearing a rather acruated description of L0rd Ruthven; however, he persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, tuangb at the same time wondered the many coincidences that all tended to excite belief in Lord Ruthven's supreme power.\nAubrey began to t0 ottacb himself more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so cantrapped with all the affected virtues, the womo among whom he had sought the bis vision of love, gained his heart; being set in motion as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, stjll hc found himself increasingly attached to the almost fairy-like form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, abandoning a plan for some antiquary research, he left, dissuaded from not returning until his object was set in motion; but he still found it impossible to fix his attentlon on the ruins of tbe around him, while in his mind he kept a tal image of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child that he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate from him with re1uctance; but it was because she no longer had anyone who could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or undoing a fragmerit whicb had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, and both, with several present, affirmed their ecstasy, pale of horror to the very ncl. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one or two of his excursions, and to stop him for a few hours; when Thcy heard the name of the place, all at once begged him not to come back at night, for he had to necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after dawn, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heavy ailments of moss as immensely upori the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and threw himself to laugh at the idea; hut when he saw them trembling at his ring so da to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their bl0od freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his unattended excursion; people were surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and were concerned that hif words, flouting the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them from such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of the horse bis, and sincerely prayed to him to return, the night passed allowed the power of these beings t0 to be put iri action;—he promised. He was, however, so busy in his resorah, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the horjzon there was one of those spots which, in the warm climates, s0 quickly gather in a mass lremendous, and pour all their rage on the devoted covnry.—He, however, climbed to the paw his horse, determined lo to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twi1ight, in the so southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and erc he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his exuberant thunders had barely a resting inlerval — his heavy radn heavy forced they way through the cariopying foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet itself. Suddenly his horse took frjths, and he was overwhelmed with dreodfulrapidity through the tangled forest. The animcll finally, through the fait gue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel thclt barely raised upwards fr0m thc masses of dead breads and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust himself to get the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed HLM to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a first age, continued in an almost intact sound; he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled his head again, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, for, tb0ugh he anointed, always the sounds continued, and nothing was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he grasped immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Agairi baff1od!\" to whom a beloved laugh succeeded; and he laid himself prey to the one whose force seemed to be human: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, ho wrestled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw huge forces against the ground; – his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had lifted his hands0n his throat – when the brightness of many torches that were running through the hole of Tbe deluded him; – he immediately rosa, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the daor, and in an instant the crash of the branches, as he broke in the wood, was heard rio l0nger. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, inlaid with movirig, soon heard by these wjthout. They came in; the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each straw with heavy flakes of foot. To the desire of Avbrey tbey secrr for hcr who had omited him by his cries; he was agaln left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light 0f torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the aerial form of hjs righteous masterpieces brought into the lifeless Corsica. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; bul he still saw the same form when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his oheek, not even on the hcr lip; but there was a silence obsessed with his face that clinged almost as life lived there: — on his neck and chest was biood, on his throat were the mclrks of teeth having opened the vein: — to his men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" One litter was qvickIyformed, and Aubrey was 1aid by tbe side of ber that was recently tahim the object of luminous and fairy-tale somany visi0nf, now fallen with the life of defect that had died in it. Heknew not wbal his thoughts were — his mlnd was eaten up and seemed to flee reslectiori, and to take refuge in the vacation — he held almost unonsciovsly in his hand a naked dagger of a parljcular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by different parties who had engaged boen in the search for her that a motber had missed. Their lamentable crying, as the cjty approaches, warns the parents of a terrible cataflrophe. \"To describe their sorrow would be impossible; but when they saw the cluse af the death of their umbild, they took to Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were inconceivable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often deirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an irreproachable combination, he began to beg his form currency to spare the being. At other times, he would go to his head and curse him by cursed. L0rd Ruthucn, waved in time tbis lo arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, hearing the state of Avbrey, iminediate1y placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. He went away from his delirium, he was borrified by the stortlod in the image of the one he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by kind words hjs, involving almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more by the attenti0n, the anxiety and the carc which showed, soon reconciled with the hls preseriee. His lordshlp seemed completely changed; he appeared only the apathetic bcing that had so atonishcd Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence moved to be fast, he gradually retraced in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perc-\nHe had no difference with the old man, except at timos he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a sn1e of rnalistic exultati0n playing his lips: he did not know why, but the smile haunted him. Durjng, the last stage of the cover of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook with fear to look at the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of the orhs in tbose, turning, like our world, the neckless sun;—in fact, to appear at wisbto av0id the eye of all.\nThe Mjnd of Au6rey, by this shock, was weakened muoh, and this elasticity of the whicb spirit had once so distinguished hlm now scemed for having fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for solitudc, the spirit did not find him in the quarter of Athens; if hc sought in the midst of the ruin which he had once frequented, the form of Iantbe stood by his side – if he sought him iri the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly round tvrning, to his wild imagination, pale face and wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his 1ips. He decided to steal sories, all of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender core which he had taken from hlm during his illness, to visit these ports if Greece had seen again. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but although they rushed from one place to another, they did not look after what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to attack these reports, wbich thcy imaginod were only the inventjon of the iridividuals, wbose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. Because of this neglect of the residents' counsel, once they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On entering, however, a leaking defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks brings down the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent of their negligence; for it was hardly the party that entered the riarrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their pearls, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their gvards had left them, and, placing themselves bohirid rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the rep0rt came. Lord Rvthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a mummerit 6ehjnd the tower of cover of defiled tbe: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with shouts insultirig bode thcm advanced, and beirig exposed t0 massacre without resisting, if one of the tho-robbers should rise above and the lako in the back, they soaked both to precipitate the search iri of the enemy. They had little shelter from the rock, and Lord Rulhven received a shot in the sh0ulder, which put him down. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer holding the contest or his own peril, is surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — bis guards who, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately threw away their weapons and surrendered.\nBy promise of a great reward, Aubrey soon incited TBEM to transport his wounded frieride to a nearby hut; and, by agreeing on a ransom, he was more troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their comrade returned with the promised sum, for which he had hcld an order. The strength of Lord Ruthveri quickly diminished; in two days the mortification followed, and Dcath seemed to be accompanied by hurried steps. His conduct and appearance had not chonged; he seemed as uriorizing of the pain he had been from the objec cts aboul; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and the bis eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his resistance with more serious thori usuol—\"Assist me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I've heard Ibe decline in my existence as little as Ihat of the day of possessing; but you haven't sealed my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? Tell me h0w? I would do any lhing,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need little — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I—but life. \"-\"We don't know him. \"Sweclr by the soul of Yaur, by all your fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any being in any way, whatever may jump, or what you can see. \"His eye took hold of their bases: \"I swear!\" fajd Aubrey; he sank on his pjllow, and he no longer breathed.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his ocquaintance with this man blushed on his belly, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he snored the present of horrific s0mething awaiting him. When a thief met him, and informed him that there was no loriger, he was canveyed by himself and his comrades, retired, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to the promise they had made to his lord, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury on the place where he was. But when he climbed to the top, he found no trace of eiting the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they pointed the same rock on which they had laid the body. Indeed, his rnirid was b ewlldered ln corijectures, bul finally came back, convinced that they had buried the body of Tbe for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in wbich he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seized his inind, he had decided to leave him, and soon orviated to Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Nap1os, he worked to organize the effects he had with bim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other cases, there has been one case where\nWeaporis of offence, more or less adapted to the death of the victim. There were several daggers on ataghans. As he killed them, and examined their curious arms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with iri of the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hasteri to obtain other evidence, he has his weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, tuangb particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the haft and sheath were similar in splendor on both, and left no place to doubt; there were also 6lood drops on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way back to Rome, if the first investigations were on the lady whom he had striatched from Lord Ruthven's seductiue arts. Her parents were in distress, their forturia ruined, and she had not heard of beeri since the dispersal of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almosl restrained under so many repressed horrors; he was afraid that this 1ady had fallen a victirn to Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort speed beyond postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Ho orlived al Ccllais; a breeze, which seemed to obey his wll, so0n balfted hlm on the English coast; and he hastened at the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri thc kisses and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by her infariljne caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she clings more like a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had the riot of winning the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. Tbere wasn't of that brilliant ighl that exists only in the beatod atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His eye was never lit by the levity of the benealb spirit. There was an inelancholy carin wrapping it that caused the riot seems to be born of mlssortune, but with a little expense inside, it appeared to indicate a conscious soul of a brigbter kingdom. His foot wasn't that fiery little girl, who wanders where a butterfly or a color can linger, that is, a sedative and pensive waf. Wben alone, his face was never shaken by the smile of joy; but whcn his brother breathed his affection, and wovld ex-precence forget these deed that she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seems modible as if these eyes—this face then played in the light of their own notifying spbere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been presented to the world, for she had thought by her Guclrdians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the country.\nInenl, when he's his protector. It is now, therefore, resolved that the next salon, which was approaching quickly, sh0u1d would be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the bls fathor mansian, and fed on the melancholy that aborted him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the euentf he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. Thcy soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a diving room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing raid had not been held to be a long tlme, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of roycllty, they rushed. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he huddled with a pickle alone, he listened to everything around him, engulfed in the thal memory the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, suddenly felt his sons sawn by his arm, and a vojce was too well recognized, sounded to his ear-- \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing that a spectre would fly, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his riot at this place as soon as he first entered society. He looked until his Iimbus almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a treat, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he rushed into his car, and was driven home. He rushed into the room and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Rvthven again before him – flattered circumstances – the dagger – his oats. – He woke up, he couldn't be – the dead resurrection again! – He thought his imagination had conjured the image that his mind was resting. It is impossible that he can be real bc—he therefore decinéd to go back to society; for although he tried to strangle the Lord Rutbven, the name hung on the lips bis, and he could nat succeed in obtaining information. He left a few nights after bringing his sister to the assembly in a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave her a felf to her own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that mony was leaving, he awakened his sons, and entered another room, surrounded by several of his sisters, apparently in the carnest coriversatiori; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned raund, and resumed to bim lhose characteristics, he was most horrified. And he went forth, and slew his sister's arm, and in haste he forced her toward the street; and at the door he began to stand aside by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to pass over them, he heard the whispered voice beside him: \"Remember your oath!\", he dared not turn, bvt, hrrying his sister, soon reochedhorne.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If, before his mind had bcen absorbed by a victim, how mueh more completely was he absorbed, now tbat thc certainty of the monster's life again pressed on hjf the purchase. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, arid, it was in vain that she intimidated him to tell him what had caused her brutal conduct. He only uttered a few w0rds, and thoso terrified him. The more he thought of the mare that he was puzzled. Hisoath was astonished with bim;—was he then to allow this moron to roam, to have a ring that ruined his breath, in the midst of all that he did, and not to avoid his progress? He got shot by him. But even if he had to break his oalh, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe Bim? He thought that if he deployed his own hand to free the world from such misery; but deatb, hc remembered, bad beori already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he sowed no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for her, to sustain nature. In lasl, n0 more able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from the street lo street, anxious to steal the tbat image that haunted him. Hjf becaino neglecle dress, arid ho wondered, as often exposed to the midday sun as lo the midnight wets. He was no longer recognized; he first returned to the house of Tobe; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtaken him. If the sister, anxious for the bis sclsety, imploded people to upset him; but he was soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer more than any thought-srom. His conduct, however, suddenly carigid. Stru ok wltb tho jdea that he left by his ahsence the wholo of his frieds, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into the society inlo, and to watch him closely, anxious to do wrong, despite his oath, all those who Lord Ruthven approach with intimacy. But when he entered a room, hjs baggard and the suspicious looks were so striking, his inner chills so visible, tal his sister wcls finally forced to beg him to refrain from looking, if he his sakc, for a society that flowed so strongly hiin. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards showed interstitialness and, in making it appear that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that was before being imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had experienced daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the gcneral eye those who are in the darkness of what they consumed madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, arid take care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, if ompletely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His bidding became so great that he was confined to his room. He is often lying there for days, inoapahle to be a rouff. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — either only the sign of the afoctlon and the remaining memory appeared on his sister's entrance; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with the bitterly distressed thy appearances, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't praise bim,\" if your love for me is great, don't come near him! However, when Sho asked whom he was speaking to, his only answer was: \"Really! And again it sank in a state, that there was no cven sbe that would have caused it. This lasted for months: gradually, archever, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less freqvenl, and his mind cast away from his morosity, while the guards of hjs observed, that several times in the hc day would count on his fjngers a defined number, and then smile.\nTbe time hcld almost arrived, when, on the last day of the year, one of his gvardians entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melancholy circumcite of Auhrey's being in such a terrible situation, when his slster went the next day to get married. Immediately Aubrey's alteration was stirred; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, from wbich they feared that he had been deprived, tbey mentioned the name of Count os Marsden. Thinking that he was a Yung Count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and amazed them even more by expressing his will to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sjstor. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influenco of his beautiful sinile; for hc pressing to his chest, arid kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again allied to feelings of affection. He 6egan to speak with all his heat wontod, and your oongratulato hcr on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived o locket on his breasl; open it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who hcld so long instilled his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled iturider foot. When he asked him why he thus destroyed the resemhance of his future Hus6 and looked as if he did not understand the ber, then took hold of his hands, and looking at the ber with a frantic expression of his face, he made him swear that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not advclence—it seemed af if this voice clgairi reminded him of his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Rutven was near him but did not distort anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the physiclan, who had hindsight, and thought it was only a reminder of his trouble, entered, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees from bis to them, he begged them to delay them, but for one. They, attributing to the folly they imagined, had seized his mind, tried to pacify it and withdrew.\nThe Lord Rutbuen had clenched in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Au6rey's ill health, he easily understood himself to be the cause of Jt; bul when he appreciated that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened your bosom from his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the pretenoe of great affection for the arid brother interest in his destiny, hc gradually won Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had arid dangers to count—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except to whom he was speaking;—could say how, sinco he knew her, her existinoe, had begun to appear worthy of conservation, except that he could listen to horrific soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the serpent's art, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the eldest branoth fell to him in Iength, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state), which was to take place on the very day of his departure for the tho continiter.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servanls, bul in valn. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of tbose now iri the grave, who once held his juri their arms as their hope and hope of their hause, to delay but for some swarms this marriage, on which he has denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised Thoy to deliver jt; but gjvirig he to the doctor, he better not harass Miss Aubrey's mjnd any more by, wbat he considered, tbe ravirigs of a maniac. The night pclssed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with an h0rror that can be easier to conceive than described, the occupied precparation notes. Morning's coming, and the sound of the cars broke on his lock. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually fled, leaving Hilri the guard of a helpless woman. He seizes the op0rtunity, of which one related was out of the room, and in a moment faund himself in the apartment where all were gathered. The Lord Ruthvon was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, with takirig arms by force, rushed out of the room, without a voice with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Retain your oath, except it is my bridge in the day by day, your sisler if it is dishonored. Women are frail!\" He pushed him to his ottensors, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Auhrey could no longer stand himself; his rabies found no ventilation, had broken a vesicle of blood1, and he was transported to bed. This waf did not mention to bis sister, who was rioting when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. Tbe mclrrage has been solemnized, and tho married and married loft London.\nAvbrey's weakness has increased; the\nBlood produces symptoms of near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be hasty, and, when the midnight drink struck, to be composedly linked to what the reader believed — he immediately decided.\nThc's guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Avrey's sisler had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLDRD BYRON RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, let him choose his resting place, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sail through the Greek ArchipcIago, aboard one of His Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of this namc. The beauty of this place, and the supply of catlle and vegetables always to have there, lead many of your Brilish fels to visit it, both the men of war and the merchontmen; and tangb it is rather out of track for the ships linked to Smyrria, its bonuses largely refund for the deviation of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the sacrillier gallanted for oats with the natives, the ecclesiastical and rnyself took a ramble at the cave called Schoal de Homer, and other places, where we had been bcfor. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so riamed), we met a young Greek and we crazyd him as a guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who loft tho island four days before our arrival in his fe1ucca. \"He took me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he would have taken me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He's a weird man, a very good man. The cotta ge above the hill, enclosing the river, belongs to him, and he has an old man in charge of jt: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six zechines hvndred sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen monlhs, but not constantly; for he often fails in his felucca to the various islands.\"\nThis story was a great excusation of our curiosity, and we praise no time in haste at the home where our counlryman hcld resided. We were kindly received 6y an old man, who corried us over the marriage. It is composed of sour apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a silage lounge and a bedroom, with an enclosed spaciaus closet. They were all simply decorated: green waltzes, marble tclbles on each side, a large myrtlo iri the center, and a sm all fontairi below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed iri spring the side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa complete the furniture. In the hall of Tbe stood a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty casc book: there was no mirror, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greoce. In the lounge wo o6 served a marble recreation, once, the old man said uf, wired with books and pclpers, whincb were then jn a large trunk of scam in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contents. On the establishment of recreation are Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau's complete works; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmorman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the play of Schiller of Robberf; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Canstantinople, much torri, but English rio of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian iri and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which also remarks were made.\nThe man did: \"Tbe evil lord read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to trap them with others; but,\" he said, \"they must lie there until his return; for he is so special, thal if I move a thing with orders of ovt, he would frown on me to serve a week together; he is very good othcrways. I gave him a service, and I made the product of this farm for the pain that she took care of, except twcnty zechines that I pay to an engaged Armani who resides in a small house jn the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe operation of the outer house was pleasant. Tobe portico ln front was fifty pclces long arid fourteen wide, and the pillars of marble f1uled with black plinths and fret work cornices, (as it is now usual in the Greeian arcbite,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a sine turkey carpet, benoth cln awning of strong coarse lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on larn the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, driving light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, when we enter the hause, a small shroud glissa, grapes, lindens and lindens blazing together its borders, and under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ari ornamental wood back was p1aced, on the whicb we were told, the lord passcd many of his soothings and nights until dawn, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he was very pious, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday.\"\nThe view of this seat is what can be called \"a view of bjrd\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, covered with olive trees and blooming blueberries, and to the top of which an ancient Greek templc seemed to be majestic jri rot. A small stream from the rijns dcscendu in broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the montsairi. The smooth sea as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, terminal the view in frorit; and a little to the left, brough avista af losey chesnut and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had residoded in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name hut Domjnick, hls banker, wbo hcld went to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say: bul I am sure he will not do it,\" and can you not say, old friend?\" said I, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I will not dare.\" We did not have time to read the Armenian, but upon our return to the city we the seueral seueral particular of the seigneur isolated. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was walking on the island, and even danced with him at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton silk surd to the girls who live by weaving lhese articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to poor children. In short, be applauded to us, for all that we have gathered, for having beeri a very eccentrjc and beneulolent c haracter. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage thought appropriate to reveal. He had a moss daughter-in-law, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imagination all over the rack, guessing who tbis crawling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of disposiliion, and he had these eccentricities that mark particulargcnius. Arriving in Palermo, all ovre duhts dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been drinking in Egypt and Greece, \"The indjvidual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in MityIene.\" We had never heard the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few yeclrs of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in 0ur bclnds we recognized the reclus of Calcla jn every page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our eyes at the cottage, but we consolidated ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will come the return. I render this state of mind, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, arid in justice the good name of his l0rdship, which was grossly stoned. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, inverse to associate with the Hvman nature, or to contribute to any misfortune to appease his slumbers, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gclthered from the anecdotes of lasc Iittle. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in the poems of his seigneury, seem to raise the seat in his hosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to be attached to his actions; and his wrath for the rest of solitude is in addition a resonation 1 to mark him as a being on whose heart the Religion has put its seal, and on whose head Benevolene hatb has cast his coat. No narari can read Ibe before fun \"traits\" feel proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his love or pleces, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with cauti0n, especially when directed agonizing the moral integrity of man; and he dares to justify himself before awsu1 tribincll where a1l must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his gcnius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest of the contraindications of a virtuous heart and self-collision consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-c0urt, Fleet-street.",
    "6": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this talo js founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, tal a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually irritated, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the deod rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and terrified. In Wesl, this is a slight variation, all the regions of Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the belfactory existed, that the vampyres, during the night, soaked in part of the blood of their victims, were emaciated, lost their strength and died quickly from consumption; while these human blood suckers were fattening—and that the veins of Burmese became distended to such a replenishment of the af, in order to shed the blood of all passages of their bodies, and even of the pores themselves of their skin.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, os courso, credible aec0unt os a parlicular case of vampyrism, which is declared to have taken place in Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appears, in an examination of the commander in ohief and magistrate of the place, that about five years earlier, a certain H eyduke, named Arn0ld Paul, had heard that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormerized by cl vampyre, but had four ways to get rid of the evil, by staggering the grave of the vampyre, and by rubbing himself with blood. This precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people mocked him for having been tormented, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. For preuent other mischjef, inhabltants tbe having consulted their Hadagni, took tho body, and found (as it is supposed to be usual cases of iri of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free frorn corrption, and emit to the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid 6lood. The Havirig evidence was therefore obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Poul's heart and body, where he was pushed back to drool shouted as terribly as if he had bad 6th alive. That's what they did, and they burned his body, and threw the Ephesians into his grave. The same measures were taken with the horns of those who had died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn be 6 of them who survived them.\nTbe unluersaI belief is, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his stomach.\nA judicial officer from Chjef.\nThis monstrous r0domontade is related to hore, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of presenl lhan observations any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, this is a kind of punishment after the dcath, for some ovine crimes committed when they existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but that he has begun to confront his infrnal visilations with these beings that he is loved m0 last while on the orth, those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection.\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corse shall thaw from his tomb; theri hauntly the place of origin, and suck tho blood from all thy wreath; there of tby daugbter, sister, wife, midnight drain the stream of Iife; yet hate the prohibition that persecutes shall feed thy corse livjd liuing, thy victims, are yet exhaled, They shall know the devil for their sire; As ye cursed, ye cursed, thy flowers wilt upon the grave. But the one who for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shail bIesf thee with the name of a father—This word will engulf the heart in flame! Yet you must mark the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see Who freezes o'er they lifolass blue; Then with the hand unshackled shalltcar The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock that Affeetian the dearest pledge has been worn—But now is carried away from you Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood of himself will dra ip; your grinchy tooth, and ljp of hook; then hunting at your sulten tomb, Go—and with Govls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the specter rnormed that they.\nMr. Soulhey also introduced in his wild but benevolent poem of \"Thalaba\", the uampyre Corsica of the Arab servant 0neiza, which is represented as hav ing returned from the tomb to the purpose of tormenting hlm that she loved better during existence. But this cannot 6th supposedly be the result of the sinfulness of her llfc, she wailing has spread throughout the whole tale as the complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long ride in his trcclvelf of several amazing ccls of vampyrism, for wbich he claims to have been an eycwitnefs; and Calmet, iri his great work on his subjoct, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditi0nary narratives illustrating their efsects, has pvt forward some dissertations learned, readyririg to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting n0ticef on this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the presenl may suffice for the limits 0f a note, necessarily dedicated to explanatiori, and which can now be enunciated by simple remarkjng, that if the term Vampyre is the 0ne in general acceptedatiori, here are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThere are vampires.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the ottensive dissipations of a London winter, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank, appeared to the various parties. He looked at the mirth aro und him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the laughter of the lawman drew his attention, so that ho could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into the breasts where modesty reigned. Those who fell this feeling of apprehension could not explain that it arose: some attributed it to the grey tbedead eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to pone, and at a glance to pierce through the inner work of the heort; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the hoofs; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the violent excement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of attracting their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of the face, whooh has never gained a warmer hue, either of the blush tbe of modesty, or fram the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain his attention.\nLady Mercer, who had been the mocker of all the monsters in the drawing rooms sinco her marriage, threw himself in her way, and nailed himself 6ut pulsations on the dress of a montebarik, to attract bis notlce:—although in uain:—when fho stood before him, although his cyes were firmly fixed on her, it still seemed that they were uripercejved;—evcn his inapplicable impudence was bafsled, and fhe Ift the sield. But tangb the adultrefs comm0n could not influence even the guidance of the eyes of hjs, there is not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but sucb was an apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent girl wlf, that few knew that he was never addressing himself hlmself t0 semales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and even if it was that he overcame the fear of singularity, or that lhey wero was moved by his hatred of vice, he was often boned among women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtues, as amorig those who shook her by their vicef.\nAt about the same time, in London there was a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was a 0rphen left with a single sister in possession of a great Beltb, by parents who died while he was still a child. He was also left to himself by the guards, who, however, their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they reliquidated the more important task of bjs mnd to take care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated moro his imagination than his judgment. He had, henee, this ramantic femling hib of honor and frankness, which every day ruin many apprentices of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and to say that vice was cast by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the vestirig of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eyes of the painter by irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that the poet's dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay eircies, Mcny rothers surrounded him, trying to erase with the least truth their long-suffering or blushing favors: the girls at the time of fame, by their brilliant faces wben he approached, and by their sparkling eyos, when he opened his lips, soon led hirn in false riots of his talents and hjs deserved. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he surprised wcls to find, that, excpt iri the tallow and wax candles that freaked out, not of the presence of a ghost, but of lack of snvffing, there was no flea in real lfe for one of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions ironed out in the volumes of thoso, srom that he had formed his study. However, by finding a certain vanity of corn ln bis gratjfied, he was about to sniff his dreams, wben the extraordinary 6eing we described above, trampled him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the vcry imp0ssi-\nthe ability to f0rming an idea of the charac-\nA man completely abhorred in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, ironed hy the avoidance of tbeir c0ntaet: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flatters his propensity to extravagant ideas, he folly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the appearance of the hif fantasy, rather tuna tho person before bim. He acquired himself with him, paid him ottensions, and, until now, advanced on his n0ticus, that his presenee was always recognized. He learned graduatedly that Lord Ruthven's affairs were umbarrasscd, and found, according to the preparation notes in — Streot, that he was about to travel. Desiring to gain some information about this singular character, wbo, until now, had overcame his curiosity, he suggested to hjs gvardians, tbal it was time to bim to execute the hur, which for many low generatiens was deemed necessary to allow the ourig to take fast sorne ftepf in tho career vice towclrds puttirig lhemselfs on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow this cm to appear as if the madness of the fkie s, whenever scandalous intriguous are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, acquire to the degree of competence that there is to carry them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately begging Lord Ruthven for his intentions, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by sucb a mark of esteem of him, who, little by little, had nothing in common with the other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHitherlo, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he f0und, that, although much more of his aclions were exposed to his point of view, the results of the different cred conclusionfjoris fram patterns apparent to the conduct of hls. His cornpanion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to revive their immediate war. Bvt Aubrey could not help but point out that it was a riot over the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes which accompanied him even on virtue, which he hesitated to his a1ms; — they were sneezes of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he came to ask for something, not to relieve the hjs, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him still into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him t0 the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstantial about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more jmpressed upori his mind: the whole th on which it was granted, inevitably fovrid that there was a curse on him, for they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk down and the most abject misery. At BrossIs and in other cities through the quajch, they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion approached all the vices in fashion; they entered into all the spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always gambIod with success, except where tbe knew more sharp was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the immutable face, with which he generally looked at the society around: it was not, howevcr, so when he enoounled the young rashf ul navice, or fatber him without luck a great Samily; then he very wlsh the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the bed while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from tbe circlo, he worshipped, cursed, in the soiitvde of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him into the roarings of this fiend; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the air speaking af mute childreri hungry, without a single farthirig of hjs late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to fatify their prefent craterrig. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but he immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, tbe Iast golder, he had just escaped from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this migbt but being tho resvlt of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, prevented him from resigning from this charity and plea which proved to ruin everyone, and did not go to his own profit; — but he dela yod — for every day hehoped his friend would give bim an opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthveri in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrcy was near the object of bis curiosity, hc did not obtain more gratification of him than the constant excitation of vain1y wanting to break this mystery, wbich to bif exalled imagination began to assimilate clpparance or something fupernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his companion; he let him attend every day the marning ceremony of an Italian countess, crying that he was going in fear of the memorials of another deserted city of Alrnoft. While he was so engaged, letters came from Erigland, which he opened with impatience; the greatest waf of his sisler, breathing only from the affécllon; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he were evil, he entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his comparison, they seemed to give him sufficient resonance for belief. His guardians instilled on bis immodiately leave his friend, and urged, that his character was terribly viciovs, for this possession of jrrefistible powers of seductlon, makes the Bi licentjus habits more dangerous to the focus. It had been discovered, that bis conternpt for the adultross had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had bad need, to strengthen his alficatjon gr, the victim lhat hif, the partner of his guil, shovld to be precipitated from the pinaole of the non-sulliode virtue, to the low-sl abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those femalos which he had sought, apparently because of the virtue os thoir, had, since his departure, thrown aside the mask, and had not grated to expel all the deformity of their vices in the public eye.\nAubrey delermined on the leavirig one, whose character had not yet shown a single brjght poinl on the whjch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretexl to abandon it completely, purposing, on average, while, to look at it more closely, arid not to let pass any slight circummstances without attention. He clings in the same circle, and soon peroeived, tbat his Lordship was eridclovouration to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose h0use he mainly frequented. In Italy, it is rare for a woman who is urimarized to be met in society; hc was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that on the assignment had been supplemented, which would probably end in the ruin of an irinocent daughter, though insensitive. Without wasting time, he entered Lord Rulhven's apartment, and abruptly asked her for her wilh's intentions respect to the lady, jnforming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to sneeze him that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would be done on such an occasion; and when asked if he intended to marry him, he simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately shouting a note, to say, that from this mother, he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit of Tbeir, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only with regard to the daughter hor, 6ut also with regard to the character of her Lordshjp. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day was content to attack his servarit so as not to stick to a separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interpository.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps to Greece, and crossed the Penlnsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek, and soon took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, shameful for having timed the acts of free men only b before slaves, hcld hid under the sheltering ground or mony c0loured lichen. Under the roof of sclme like himself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to spread ori canvases the promised hope of faithful tbe in Mohammed's paradise, except that the eyes ber spoke too inind so that someone thought that she might belong to lh0se wbo had no s0uls. As she dancod on the plairi, or tripped alorig on the side of the mountain, a wovld looked up1 a bad type of its waters b; for who would have exochanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious jeook sleep of the suitable animal but for lbe taste of an epic. Ianthe oflen's ftep light accompanied Aubrey jnhis in search of antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of Kashmere's butterfly, shaw all the beauty of the ber shape, floating as it was on the wind, to linger gazec of him, who forgot the letters that he had deciphered upwards an almost effaceable tablet, in the contemplator 0f his figure of sylph. Often, trosses fall, as it wilts the oron, expose in the ray of the sun sueb delicately brilliant and fleetingly discoloring the hues, it harms well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object which he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing rooms and stifljng balls. While drawing remains of thafc which he wanted to keep a memory of for his future hours, she stopped, and swept away the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she asked him to dance in circles on the opening, pointed to him in all the brilliant colors of young memory, the marriage pump remembered when he saw his childhood; and then, turning to objects that had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His eo nrestnesf and his apparent belies of what is told, excipients the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she recounted the story of the living vampy, which passed badly in the midst of the hjs friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a loyal young girl to prolong her existence f0r the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at it by such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of old men, who had detected in Lasl one living among them, after several of their rallatives and children had been found marked by the lamp of the appetite of the fiend; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged to believe it, because he had been, pointed out, tbat those who had dared to question the existence, always had some evidence given, which forced them, with grief, to confess it, it was true. She detailed to him the tradilional appearance of these monsters, his horror increased, by bearirig a protty description accvrate of Lord Ruthven; however, he again harassed by persuading her, that there could not be truth in the hcr fears, at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so controstcd wilh all tho affected virtuos of women that he had sought for hjs visi0n of romance, won hels heort; and while ridiculed lheidea from a young mcln of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, slill he found hjmself increasingly attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian rescarch, he left, decided not to return until her object was reached; but hc still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins around bim, while iri his mind kept a denage that seemed to be the only righteous possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe disagreed with the love of the hjs, and he was still the same frank child he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could have visited her favorite haunts, that the ber's guardian was greedy in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had escaped tbe destructivo band of timc. She wrongly appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror to the dwarf itself. Soon aftor, Aubrey decided to proceed vpon one of his excursions, wbich was of him detairi for a seam of hours; They heard the name of the place, all at the same time begged him nool to come back at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where there would not remain a Greek wouid euer, swollen the day had cl0sed, on any consideration whatsoever. Tbey described it as the station of the vampyres in the noctumal orgies of lhejr, and denoou put in place the most heclvy af evils lingering upwards of the one who dared your oross thcir path. Aubrey made the light of their repeseritcltioris, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling al his darng so to mock a higher, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their free blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for a bis excursion without being appalled; bewas surpr ised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was coricerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thofo h0rrible fiends, hod inspired them from such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and sincerely prayed Hjm of rolum, ouch night allowed the power of the beings of lasc to be pulsed in action;—he promised. However, he was so ocupiated in his research, that ho did not perceive lhat light-day erid, and that in the horizon tbe lerc was the ane of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their ragc upori the devoted canister.—He, however, finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; the sun sets, the night begins: it had advanced very far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had an interva1 of rest — its thick rain heclvy forcod itf through the canned foliage, wbilst the 6th forked ligbtning seemed to fall and radiate to its very sensation. Svddenly bis horse got scared, and it was carried with terrible speed through the enlangIed forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and he began to four, by the glare of the glare, while he was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust himself to get shelter from the stork. As he approached, the thunder, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible shrioks of a wombln mingling with strings, exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in 0ne his almost uribroken;—he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that rolled his hcad again, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He was in the darkness vtcr: the sound, however, guided him. It seems that it was not perceived; sor, though called ho, still tbo sounds corituated, and no remark of it was taken. He snuck into contact with someone, who rose up immediately; when the voice cried out, \"Always scorned!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sow life as dearly as possible, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and set himself at the vanguard with ardour against the ground: — his enemy fell upon him, and kneeled on bis brcast, had put his hands above his throat — wben the glaro of several torches penetrating as he penetrated into the hole that gave light in the day, moved him away; — be instantly repulsive, and, leaving bisprey, rushed into the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the water, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to 0f m0ving, was soon heard by the th0se without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they pressed for the one who had attracted him with his cries; he was again in the darkness; but wbot was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnoré burst upon him, to perceive the f0rm of ajry from his beautiful conductor brought into the corsc without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that was brightening up his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, if he did not close tbem, scattered on the bis side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his tbot face seemed more attached than the life that once lived there: — on the neck and the blood of the hem of the chest, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein of the tob: — to this men pointed, wept, at the same time weakened themselves with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had been jealously the object of so many visions of the sling and the fairy, now fallen with a fleur de vie thal had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to be moving away, he almost unconsciously took refuge in his hand a naked dagger of built cl paricular, which had been found in the cabin. They soon met different parts that had been erected in search of the ecr that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, they learned clty, warned the parents of some dreadfvl catostrophs. \"Décrire leur grieving would be impossible; but when they afcerlalné tbe causc of the affair of their cbjld, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They are inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to the test was seized of a violent fever m0st, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthvon and on Ianthe—by some incompetent combinatiori he seemed to be begging for his companiori sormer to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would impretate evil people on his head, and ours will lock him up. Lord Rutven, changed at that time upon arrival in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately put hese1f in the same h0vse, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and gripped by the sight of the one whose evil image he now has combined with the lhat of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, still sworn by the atticion, the anxiety, and the care that ho showed, soon reconclamated him to his presence. His seigneury secreted completely changed; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convaIescence began to be crooked, ho again gradually connected in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceivod n0 difference from the old man, excepl that sometimes he was surprised t0 to meet his gaze flxed intensely on him, with the smile of malicious exultaljon playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tideless wave raised by the cooling breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the still suri;—indeed, he hastened to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by a shock of tbis, was weakened by the mucb, and this elasticity of the mind that had once so dislinguished him now vuine at hclve was fleeing forever. Today he was as in love with solitude and silence as the Lord Rvthvcn; but although he had taken the solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Atheris; if he did so in the midst of the vineyards he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; if he turned suddenly, he huddled, with his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile hcr lips. He decided to steal scenes, each exploiter of which has created such spirit associations. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken during his illness, to visit these parts of Greece and which he had not yet seen. Tobey traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but although they had thus seized from one place to another, they did not seem to consider what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to make a report from Tbesc, whom they imagined to be the jnvcntion of the individualaIs, whose interest was to extract the generality of those whom they defended against the preterids dangers. As a result, neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they traveled wildly a few guords, more to serve as thari guides as a defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the wbich was the bed af a torrent, with large massifs of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they have bad reasons to repent of their negligence; for hardly was the wbole of the party engaged in the narrow collar, which they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo report of several guris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves in rocks, had begun to fire in the direction that the report had come. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, irritating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend of defilement: they were humiliated by the bejng, thus held by an enemy, who, with shovels the badc avant ce, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers shovld ascended to the rear and took them to the rear, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They were barely sheltered from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shovlder, which brought him to the earth. Aubrey hastened to his asphyxiation; and, no longer taking into account the competition or his own peril, was soon surprised by the fact that the faces of the robbers were irritating him, his gourmands having, on Lord Ruthveri's wounded, immediately threw down the weapons and rendered him dead.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon jnducha passed on his wounded friend to a nearby cabiri; being enraged on a ransom, he was no longer dlstvrb by their priest — they were simply absent to keep the entrance until their c0mrade returned with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveri's strength decreased rapidly; in two days the inortificatlon followed, and death seemed advanclrig with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had of 6 towards him: but towards the end of last night, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, crouched his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with more than usual care—\"Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you save my honor, yovr srjend's hanour. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I need a little bit of my life, I can't do it, but if you were to give me everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was long unknown, I was in England, but I was there. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your vile dreams, by all your natural fears, if you fear that, for a year and a day, you will not ignore your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eye seemed inflamed with their socks, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he ran down his pillow, laughing, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but didn't sleep; the many circumstances that saw her acqui...\nHe didn't know why. When he remembered his oath of a cold cleavage waiting for him, he approached something horrible. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the Chamber in the Chamber, he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by bimself arid comrados, at the top of his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promif thcy had given his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey stunned, and took several tbe meri, determined to go and bury jt on where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he had no body traco or clothes, although the thieves burned, they emphasized the identical rock on which thcy had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally remurdered, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a c0untry in which he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which all apparently conspired to pretend that superstitious mlancholia who had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol to transmit it to Otranto, or to Naples, he took care to arrange theosomes he had with him extending to Lord Rvthven. Among other things, there is a case where jng wcapons febriles of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the death of videotim. There were several daggers and ataghans. What surprised him to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dag gre djscovered in the fatal hut, he shuddered, rushing to get other evidence, he tidyed the weaving, and his horror mcly to be imagined when he discovered that jt was equipping, particularly broke, the sheath that he held iri his hand. His eyes began not to need anything else, they sawmod looking to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted your disbelief; but the particle shape, the same varying shades on the haft and the sheath were alikc in the splendor on both, and did not leave a place far away; there were also drops of lood on each.\nHo left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his fjrst investigations were about irig the lady he had tried to seize Lord Ruthven's sedative arts. Her priests are in distress, their petunc is ruined, and she had not been heard of the departure of the seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became a1mosl broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been victimized by the destrayer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and hlsonly occupation putist by vrugating the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calclis; a breeze, wbich seemed obedient to his wll, soan ballotta him on the English coast; and he hastened at the house of the hlf fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all memory of the past. If before, by her infernitine caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the womari began to appear, she was even more endearing...\nIt hurts the companjon.\nMiss Aubrey had only to win thanks to wbich goins tbe look and a copy of the assembly of the living room. There was light brilliance nary only wlcb exis ts in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was devoured by the 1st ofthc spirit below. There is here a melancholy charm about it that seemed riat appear unlucky, but the feeling of sorno inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not that slug foot, which goes astray where a butler or a collarer can attract – he was sedate and pensive. When al 0ne, her sace was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her afsection, arid wouild in her presence forget those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that tbose eyes—that face then played in tb light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been brought into the world, he had been bought by his guardians more appropriate than his presentcltiori should be declyed until the return of his brother of conlirian lhe, that he could be his protector. So it was now decided that the next drclwing-roam, whincb was fast clpproaching, should be the epoch of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to reminisce in the mansiori of his hawks, and sinked into the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the most fashionable, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had wilnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to iri city, and prepared for the next day, and what had been announcod as a parlor.\nThe crowd was exceeding: a living room had not been held long, and all those who were impatient with bosk in the smile of the kingship, rushed to go. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a corner by himself, without taking into account all that was around him, he remembered that the first tjmo he had seen Lord Ruthven was there – he suddenly felt seized by the arrn, and a v0ice which he recognized too well, sounded to his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He hardly had the courage to turn, fearing to see a spocter that blastbim, when he perceived, with a little dislance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered the soeiety. He fought until his alinost limb refused to bear the weight of Tbeir, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to let pass a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was taken home. He passed the room with horrjed steps, and fixed his harries on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven ogoin before him — circumstances began in the dreadfuI picture — the dagger — sanctified.—He blushed himself, ho could not believe that it was possible — the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had averted the image that his mind refuted. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; for he tried to ask about Lord Ruthveri, the name hung up to his lips, and hecoveld failed to obtain computeriori. He went a few nigbls aster with his sisler to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a rnatron, he retreated to a reef, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Perceivlng, finally, which many were leaving, he awakened hirnscls, and entering another room, found his thin envelope by several, apparently in serious conversaliori; he ottempled to pass and approach her, when someone, who he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him the thossc traits he most abhors. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, in the spirit of the rushed march, forced her to go around the street: at the door, he sounded himself hindered by the crowd of servants waiting for their lord; and while he undertook to pass, he heard again that voice which whistled to him—\"Remember your oath!\"—Hc dared not turn, but, pressing on from his sister, he soon reached Hame.\nAubrey became a distracted almosl. If, before his mind was absorbed by a suffering ct, how much more completely was he absorbed, now that the eertainty bones the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attraction was now without hesitation, and it was in vain that she treated him to explain to him what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who terrified him. The more he went astray, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him; — was he himself to bring down this monster at R0am, bloody ruining on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been touched by Bim. But even if he harassed his oath, and revealed supplications, who would blame him? He used his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he shoved himself into a lbis; locked in his room, he saw one, and he ate only when his sisler came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, no danger able to carry sti1lness and loneliness, he is afraid that his house, wandering from street to street, anxious t0 will steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wcdered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at 1 , he put him to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, who was associated with him for his sastity, employed people to follow him; they were soon told by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that Hc left by his clbsenee that of his frieries, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were uriconscient, he soaked up to enroll again in s0cicty, and watch him clonely, anxiouf lo preewarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthvon approaches with jntimace. But when one entered a room, his bag and his distrustful eyes were so dizzying, his inner shivers so visible, that his sister was finally oligated to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a sawhood that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene, and fearing that his mjnd would be alienated, they had the great time to regain the trust that had previously been imposed by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent the bimbom from exposing to the general eye those marks of wbat which they considered to be madness, they forced a doctor to reside in the house, and to take the constant heart of him. He did not object to notice it, if completely his mind is absorbed by a terrible subject. His inoherence finally became so great that he was locked in his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. His eyes had fastened a glass; — the only sign of the afsection and the remaining memory appeared on the eritry of his sist er; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near Hlm if your love for me is great, don't come near Hlm!\" Wben, however, she asked who he referred to, his anlyanswer was, \"True! True!\" and agairi he sarik in a state, from which she could not even roam hlm. Thif lasted many months: grcldually, however, as the year passed, his iricaherences became less frequent, and his mind ripped out a dark part of it, while his guards observed, that several times in the day, he was able to count on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe tlme had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians eriteriririg his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melanéholy circumconstance of the being of Aubrey in so horrible situationatjon, when the sister hjs was going riext day to get married. Aubrey's attention was drawn, he impatiently asked whom. Glod os this mark of return of the intellect, of which they feared that it had been deprived, lhey mentions the name of the EclrI of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that he had met wilh in society, Aubrey seemed pleclused, surprised them even more by expressing his intention your being present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brace, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once rnoré alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so diftligued away row and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which was his surprlse at beh0ldlrig the traits of tbe monstor who had iriflucnced his life so long. He grabs the portroit in a paroxysm of ragc, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he destroyed the white rose of his future Husbaride, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a frontal expression of face, he told him to swear that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not move forward—jt seemed as if this voice again asked him to reborn his oalh—he turned abruptly around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him bul did not see anyone. The guards and the doctor, who had heard the sholo and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered and sent him away from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees and begged them to delay them, but one day. They attributed this folly to Hod's possession of his spirit, and tried to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with the evcry another. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily became irritated to be his causc; but when he suggested that he was regarded as insancuous, his exultatlon and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the houso of his former companion, and by his attendance, and by the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. What resists his power? His language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the gold earth, except with her whom he addressed;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, hcld began to seem worthy of conservation, if jt wcre simply that he could listen to his soothing clcoentf;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, which was won by his affections. The bed of the elder branch falling in the back, he obtained a jmportante embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (jn despite his brother's disturbed impasse), which was to place the lake the same day he left for the continent.\nAu6rey, when left by the doctor and gvardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was givcn hlm; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the horror of those who now in the grave, who once held their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sewn that marriago, 0n who are denounced the heaviest curses. Tho's servants promised it, but by giving it to his doctor, it is better not to harass Miss Auhrey's mind anymore by, what he considered, the maniac roses. The night passed without rôde to the occupied prisoners of the house; and the board of directors of Au6rey, with a horror that can be easier to conceive than described, riots of busy preparation. The morning came, and the carrjage sound broke on the bis ear. Aubrey grew up aum0st frantic. In the end, the servants' claries seized their vigilancc, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the eust0dy os an old waman helper. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and at o momerit was in the apartment where all wero almost assembled. The Lord Rvthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immoderately, and, taking his arm in advance, pressed him out of the room, voiceless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Render your oath, and know, if my bride is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So be moved to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage found no ventilation, had brokered a vessel of blood, and it was passed on to bod. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present whori he entered, as the physian waf feared to stir it. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness has worsened; blood effusiori has produced symptoms of the ncar's death opproach. He wanted the guards of his fisher to be called, and when midnight had struck, to be in touch with what the reader had struck, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; bul when they stopped, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was quite implored to him, where to choose his place of rest, and Gravence his guide.\"\nEN Sailing through the Greek archipelago Iago, aboard one of the ships of bis Mojesty, in 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, iri the island af this name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found there, lead many British ships to visit it, both war merchants; and although it is rath er of the trock for the sbips bovnd in Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyago. As usual, at the bottom of the 6ay, and while the men were used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating with the natives, the ecclesiastical and I looked at a twig at the cave of the Homer ceiled school, and other poloques, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met the spirit and hired a young Grcek as guide of the dawn, wbo told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the arid Greek, \"would have taken me with him; but I did not choose a quil Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was a strange man, a very good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, helorigs lo hiin, and he left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-tr ader, six hundred 2echlnes for her, (abovt L250 Eriglishcurroncy,) and lived there ab03t fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his selucque very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis story excjted ovr curiosity a lot, and we lost no hold in the haste at home where our peasant had remained. Wo were graciously received by a man who led us over the house. It consisted of apartmonts sour on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet encl. They simply adorn: walls of green colour, marble tables on the aid of the eitber, a lar ge myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which are played through the branches by moving a spring fixed in sidec tbe from a small Venus of bronze in a bent pasture; a large sofa or sofa completes the furnilurc. In the room there were half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty library: there were no painters, n0r a single painting. The bedroom had mercly a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pilIow — the common bed soaking in Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the O1d mcln, filled with books of mind and papers, which were then in a large chesl of scam in the closet: it was opera, but we did not thjnk nosselvos justified by examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the revesf's tablet; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, iri the German Ianguoge; Klopstook's Mefsiah; Kolzebue's riovels; the game of the Robberf of Scbiller; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editjon, printed in Parma in 1810; several smclll pamphlets in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, writings with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old husband said, \"The Lord had read these books 6 before he sapped, and he forgave to place them with others; but, he said, they must hide his return there; for it is so special, that if I had moved something without order, he would frown me for a week together; otherwise it is very good. I did him a favor once, and I used this farm for the evil of lakirig, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the Iord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearances of the house of cxternally was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marhle canned with black pits and fret work cornices (as is now customary in the Greek architect), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof of Tbe, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a carpet of fir turkey, under an awning of coarse flax str0ng. Most houso-tops are shaved with tbuses, as on them the Greeks spend their eternity in smoklng, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streomelt slipped, grapes, rings and ljmos erro clvslcring together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bvs of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking lo heseIf. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" because he was very fervent, \"Arid has always attended our Twi church this week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe point of view of this seat was what one might call a \"bird view\". A line of rieh vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam that came out of the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until he was losl in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as glass, and a horizon not shaken by a single cloud, finishes the iew in front; and a little ori to the left, through a vlsta of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wove with spols of emerald greeni. I knew how to appreciate a uiew inore that I did not; but our requests were irrelevant as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone badly to Candia. \"Tobe Armcnian,\" said our chief, \"could say, but I'm sure he won't, \"and cann0t tell you, old friend?\"I said, \"If I'm an,\" said to be, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit lhe Armenicln, but on our return to the city we had several peculiarities of isolation lo rd. He had shared the young girls eigbt when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, ho rscs to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live with these items. He also had a new boat for a fisherman who had raised his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old frierid at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful moss daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and hc hcld bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself how to use it.\nThis was the inf0rmation with which we got rid of the peaceful island of Mitylene; our iinaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramblcr in Greece would be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark the peculior geniuf. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who was travelling in Egypt and Greeco, \"Individual Thc,\" he said, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on the tenedos theislarid, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Chjlde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we renounce the reclus of Calc1a in every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious in our cottoge research, but wc has consoled himself with the idea of returning to Mitylerie some future day; but to me the day will never turn. I render this statesman, I sit him without interest, and Iri justice to the good narno of his seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. He was described as a dispossession of urifeling, inverse to association with the Burmese nature, or contributing in any way to appease his grief, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, like mayhe plajnly gathored from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, the fympclthy, and the ehclrity resemble each other to guide all his octaons; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that gnaws the hiin like a beirig on whose heart the Religion has sealed, and on whose head Benevalericehath threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryrnan. Wilh sums up his pleasures, I have the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they affect the morol integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself, that is, the awfuI court must all appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make the good soret, and avoid the applause of the world, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and approval of felf c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crowri-ovrt, Fleet-Street.",
    "7": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidorl\nTHE plorestition on which this tole is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be Cammon: it laughed, commentcver, extends to the Greeks till after the establishment of Christianity; and it only assumed that it presents form finces the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in the thoir torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many sumptuous stories, still existing, tbe ris dead from their tombs, and clinging to the 6 moon of young and beautifultho. In the West, it spread, with a few slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there is a belief, that the vampyros soaked some of the blood of their victims, who emaciated the bee, lost their strength, and quickly deduced consumption; and that the same welders of human blood, fattened, and their veins were dissolved by such a state of repletion, in order to cause the charge of all passages of their body, and even of the very skin of pores, to flow.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious and, of course, a credible reception of a particular case of vampyrism, which, if declared to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. He seems, that at the examination of the commander of the ecbief and the magistrates of the square, they unanimously affirmed that, with regard to fiue years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, ho had been torinente by a vampyre, but had sounded a way to get rid of evil, eating from the soil of the suine of the tomb of the vampyro, and rubbing with the bl0od hif. This precauli0n, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death, many people complained of being tarnished by him, and of depositing wos, that four people had been deprived of life by his touching. To avoid other malice, the inhabitants having consulted Lejr Hadagni, taken the body, ond found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. After being obtained, they returned to the usual remedy. A pole was completely led through Arnold Paul's listening and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were odoptod with the corses of these persori who had previously died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on the olhers who svvived lhem.\nThe universal lie is that a sucked 6ya vampyre porson itself becomes a vampyre, and sucks in its lvm.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rod0montade is related here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject in the present observations than any other example that might be presented. In many countries of Greece, it is considered as a prison sentence after death, for a heinous erime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but compressed to limit his infernol visitatioris sold to those who loved the earth most, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—Asuppositiori allvd to in the \"Giaovr.\"\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, your c0rese shall be praised from his tomb; then the ghast1y haunts the native placo, and sprinkles the blood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the flow of life; yet, hate the banquet whicb porforce Must sow your living livjd Corse, Your victims, have yet come to an end, Know tbe demori f0r As cvrsirig you curse them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever for the crime will fall, the youngest, the best beloved of Oll, will bless you with the name of a father—This word will engulf him in flames! Yet, Thau must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the spark of bcr's eye, Aridthe last glassy look must see Who freezes o'cr his lifole blue; Theri with a non-hail0wed hand will tear The braids of his ycllow hajr, of which, jn lives a lock when thorn the background pledge of Disorder has been worn—But now is carried away by lhoe Memorial of thi ne agoriy! But with tbiria his best blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at thy tomb, G0 — and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors of Jn depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the corso vampyre of the Arab Moids Oneiza, which is represented af having returned from the grave in order to torment him, she loved best wbilst in existence this. But it cannot be supposed to have reborn from the sinner 0f her life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The true Tovrnefart giv is a long story in his travels of several oslonizing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of aneodotes, and the illvstrative tradltjonal accounts of its effects, put far some learned dissertations, tending to prove it at 6th a c1assical, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on this singularly horrible suprstition could be added; thovgh the presenl may suffice for the limits of the note, ncessorily devotcd lo explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, tbat th0ugh the term Vampyro is the one in the most general acceptance, there are severa1 other synonyms with it, makes use 0f in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the middle of the accompanying dissatioris during a London winter, he appeared in the various parties of the leader of the anobleman tori, more remarkable for its singularities than his rank. He looked at the mirror around Heen, as if he could not participate in Iherein. Apprenticely, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into those breasts w here the carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain who she stood up: sorno attributed her to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance pierced the axis of the heart to the iriward workeriririgs; but selling on the cheek with a leaded thalt weighed on the skin that he could pass n0t. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; oll wanted to see him, and those who had been used to the violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were bent to have some thirig in their presence eapable to engajng their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, whieh never took a warmer hue, ejther fr0m the blush of modesty, or the strong emotion of passion, although her f0rm and 0utline were beautiful1, many women aster notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mocker to every walrus in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in hift manner, arid fit al1 but put on the robe of a molebank, to attract her attention:—although in vain:—where she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently six on her, stillI it seemed that they were unperceived;—even her unapplied formudence was flounded, and she left the field. But although common adultery cannot influence even the direction of the eyes of hjs, the female sex should not be indifferent to him: however svch was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to himSi to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it is even that he has overcome the fear of his singular charaeter, or that they have been moved by his apparent hatred of vice, be also often among the lhoose women who form he boast of sex lhelr of their domestic virtues, as among those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, the era came to London a young man named Aubrey: ho was an orphan left with a single sisler in possession of a great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by the guards, who thought it was their responsibility to take care of his fate, while they rrlinquished thc morc important charge os bis rrind to he cared subaltern mercenary os, he cultivated more his imagination with his iudgment. He therefore had this romantic impulse of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtve, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the tho misery of an eottage simply corisist in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of tho palnter by irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in flne, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. That's why he surrounded himself with many mothers, who were trying to describe the heir who languished or grinch the favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he learned, and by his sparkling cyes, whom he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the romonce of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, excepl iri the candles of mowing and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a gbost, hut of lack of snuffing, therc was not a foundation in real lifo for all the bones that congregate pleasant plctures and dcscriptions oonted in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Find, how...\nver, somo compensatiari in his gratified vanity, it was absolute to refine his dreams, when the extreme being that we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gave additional signs of his observation of e xtomal objects, that he tacitize to their existence, impelled by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination your image of all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon slept this object in the hero of a romance, and dtormed to observe the spring of his fanny, rather than the person who preceded it. He became familiar with him, paid him the attentioris, arid so advanced on his riot, that his pre senco was always recogrified. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon he found the notes of preparation fram in — Street, that he was abovt lo trauel. Desiring to obtain information respects this singular character, which, until now, had only spurned his curiosity, he laughs at his guards, that it was time for him to execute the taur, which for many genres was deemed necessary to enablo the young to take a few quick sleps in the career 0f vice towards putti ng thinselvos on an equality with the old, and not to allow them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, every time scanda1ouf intrigues are beg the subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear the rn 0n. They consented: and Aubrey immediatly evoking the intentions of hjs to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, wbo, apparently, had nothing in commant with other men, to be happy to accept it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Au6rey had had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he has found, that, although rnany swears of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different c0nclusioris of lhc apparent motives t0 his oriduct. His c0mponion was profuse in his liberality; — the idlc, the vagrant, and the beggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wankers. But Aubrey neck1d not auoid pointing out, that he was not raised in the virtuous, redvc to indignation by the accompanying rnisfortunes even on virtue, that he bostoped his alms;—this one was sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wall up in his lust, or to sink it even deeper iri bis iniquity, hc was set away from charity ricb. This has been attributed, however, by hiin to the greatest importunity of the vicious, whicb usually occurs 0 times as the retirement of the virtuous needy. Thore was an oircumstratory on the charity of his Lordship, whieh was even more impressed on his mind: all those whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other loggers, they passed, Aubrcy was surprised at the apparent enormity with which his companion sought the centres of a vice in fashion; there he entered into all the dark spirit of the Faro table: he always yawned with success, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, then he hatched even more than he glinted; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generalIy looked at the Tbc society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young novice, or tbe father without chance of a family number 0us; tben his very desire seemed the love of fortune — this abscracy apparrite of the mind was set aside, and his spa-eyed eyes were set aside.\nrkled with more fire than cat tbat while diluting with half-deod anusie. In every city, he left the rich yauth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had fired him withiri the reabb of his fiend; while many a father sat frenetic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthirig of his delay irnmense weath, where with for bvy even svfache their present desire. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, in the run of the husband, the last guilder that he had ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this mill gt but being the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which is not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most experienced. Avhrey often wanted to present him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit;—bulb he delayed it—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; sloppy, it never happened. The Lord Rutbveri in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyc spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratificatjori than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break the mystery of tbat, which to his exalted bcgan imagination to assume the appearance of a somewhat supernalural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a tjmo, lost the sight of his companion; he left him in the daily enthusiasm on the morbid circle of an Italian countess, as he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, wbich ho opened impatiently; the first was from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others were srom his guclrdians, the latter astonishing hjm; if he had before entering into his imagination that there was a eurel of power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immaculate friend and exhorted, that hif choracter waf dreodly vjcious, so that the possessions of irresistible p0wers of seduction, made his licontious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery by far had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had asked, in order to improve satisfaction, that his victim, by the content of his guilt, be cast out of the pinnacle of undefiled virtue, at the beginning to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of the Burmese virtue, hcld, sjnce his departure, threw the mask asjde, and had not rescued to exacerbate all the distortion of their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a point of brigbt sjngle on whlch to rest the eye. Ho resolved to invent a little pretexl plausiblc for the total abandonment of hjm, purposrig, on average, to look carefully at tanning, and not to let pass any slight circumstance. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the Iady daugbter, of which he mainly frequented the dung. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; he has been throrefore obliged to continue his years in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all the bis wjndings, and soon will describe that a clssignation had been appoinlod, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though insensitive girl. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartmont, and stubbornly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of fame that he was sighing at her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthuen replied, that his intentions were such that he suppp0sed a1l wovld have up0n svoh an opportunity; and after being precssed whatber, he intended to marry him, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the visit proposed, he ordered his servant to search for other apartments, and to attack the mother of the lody, informing him of all that he knew, not directly with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the oharacter of his Lordsbip. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Rutbven the next day simply sent bis servant lo nativey hif complete dare to separate; but did not suggest any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the Peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied hesolf jn tracing the cards faded of ancient glory on monuments which seemly shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only by the slaves of ore, had hidden them under the shelter1 or many colors 1ichon. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, beautiful and delicate, which she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes were too full of spirit so that one could think that she could belong to those who had no soul. As it was on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have killed the look of a bad type of its beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently tbe eye of naturc arimated, for this luxurious look asleep of the suitable animal but to the last of an epic. Slight stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his sercb after antiquities, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a butterfly Kclshrnore, show all the beauty of his sorme, f1oating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had juft dccyphored on an almost effaced tablet, in contemplation of his sylpha-like figure. Often her lresses fal1lng, as she flirted around, expose in the ray of the sun suob delicately shiny and swifly fading hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the vcry abiect it bad before lhovght of importance vitol t the appropriate irriterprelation of a passage in Pausonias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without drawing rooms and suffocating balls appearing. As he drew the remains which he wished to highlight a memorial for his future hours, she would sneak in and trample on the magic effects of her pencil, plotting the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe the circular dance on the open plain, point him, in all the brilliant acolytes of the youthful memory, to the marriage pump that she thought of looking at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mjnd, would tell him all the supernatural tales os Hernvres. Her fervour and her apparent bell of what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, wbo had spent years in the midst of her frieds, and her most dear ties, f0rced each year, by attaching to the life of a lady-semale to prolong bls existincnoe during the months that followed, her bload ran cold, while he dared to laugh at these idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had finally detected a living among them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the fiend's coppetlte; and when she so sounded incredulous, she begged to help him, for he had been, rcmarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had a given proaf, which forced him, with a heart-reparing pain, he had always had a given proaf. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, gripped her husband, hearing a fairly precise endowment of Lord Ruthven; however, he persisted in persuasion of ber, that there was no truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the cojncences that all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the omong woman that he had learned for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found still glare increasingly attached to the form a1 most fajry before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a p1an for some antiqvarian research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but to be always found jmpossib1e to fix the attention bis on the ruins around him, whllst in his mind, he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his lbacheds. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was still the same frarik child he had first known. Shc has always had the charge of the fr0m part with the reluctonce; but it is because she no longer has an oon with which she had the chance to visit her favorite haunts, while her gvardian was busy sketching or discovering some fragment whieh had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parerits on the subject of Vainpyres, and both, with several resentments, affirmed their existence, pale with the same horror name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey dissuaded from proceeding with the sound of his exeursioris, which was to hold the swallow for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him nool to come back at night, for he had to necessarily pass through a woo d, where no Greek would ever be remairi, after the day had lost, on any consideration whatsoever. Tbey described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most brittle evils as imminent on hlin who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw TBem trembling at his darng so as to mock a superlor, an iriferal power, whose very name, apparently contained their blood gel, he was silting.\nHe was surprised to observe the richer face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was abovished to talk, Ianthe came beside his horse, and urged him to return, and at night lifted up the power of these eyebrows to be put into action; — he prostrated himself. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he should not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly agglutinate in a huge mass, and pour out all their rage vpon the devoted land.—He at lclst, Howevcr, riding his horse, discouraged to catch up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, it begins; and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunder echoes had scarletly ari inlerval rest — its heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Svddenly hishorso got scared, and it was carried with terrible speed through the enclngled forost. The animal finally stopped through the fatigve, and found, by the glabrous lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that removed the dead leaves and the wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a certain ori to guide him to the city, or at least to have confidence to get a shelter against the storm. As he objected, the thunders, for the sake of love, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mixed herself with the stif1e, mocked herself with a laugh, consumed herself in an almost intact sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by a thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was an app...\nThere was no insight, for he had curdled, and the aurids continued, and there was no lace of him. He found himself in the eontact with somc one, which he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out, \"Always flouted!\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt that he was fighting hy whose strength seemed to pleaserbuman: determined to sell his life as he dearly could, he fought; but he was in vain: And he fell upon him, and fell upon his breast, and his hands upon his throat, when the dazzling of the torches that entered upon the hole that gave the light of day, disturbed, and rose up instantly, and left prey, rv struck by the door, and in a moment the crashirig of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. And they departed, and the light of their torches fell upon the walls of the mud, and the thatch loaded upon every straw with heavy soot straws. At the fire of Aubrey, they sought her, who was biting with her cries; he was again in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torch was kindled again upon him, to perpetrate the air f0rm of his faltering conductor brought a corse of life. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, that he unlocked the rne, extended by his side. There was no colour on his cbek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as soothing as the life that one lived in thore: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat hcr were marks of teeth that opened the vein: — At this tbe the men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf 1aid next to her who had recently boeri to him the object of so many vsions of light and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he was doing, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the holiday, he held in his hand almost a naked dagger of a particle building, which had been f0und in the cabin. They were quickly welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, announced the porents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of the child would be impossible; but that they determined the cause of their child's affair, they looked at al-Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were inconsequential, both died in a broken heart.\nWhen Aubrey was put to bed, he had a more broken felter, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven arid on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. Al other shoots he im precal curses on his pearl, and curses hiin as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately pleased in the hovse samc, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starred at the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implyjng a very great repentance for the fault which had caused their separatori, and even more by the attention, the arrangement, and the care which he showed, soon recoricid your presence. His seigneury seemed to have changed; ho did not enjoy himself more than the apathetic bejng who had so surprised Auhroy; but as soon as the convalescence started to ignite, he withdrew again graduated in the same state of mind, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised by mcet bis gaze fixed int tly on him, with asmile de malici0us exultatjon playirrig on his lips: he knew nat why, but this smile hunlcd him. Durlng the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was engaged iri wortching the waves without tides raised by the twilight oooling, or by marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our wor1d, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to wish your avjd the gaze of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had once distinguished him so so so well now sown for having fled f0r never. He was now as lovers of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as one wants madness, his spirit does not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sows him in the midst of the ruins which he frequents badly, the form of Iclnthe stood by his side—is he sought iri the woods, his light step would appear errantamidsl the undergrowth, in the quest 0f lhe m0dest violet; tben would turn suddenly, show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a smile reborn on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, each feature of whlch created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to be bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his stay, to visit parts of Greece and not to have seen him. They traveled in each diroclion, and sowed each place for whieh a recolleetjon cov1d to be attached: 6ut thovgh they hastened so frorn place your plaoe, but they did not seem to take into account what lhey looked at. They heard many robbers, but they began to blur these relationships, which they imagined to be only the jnvenllon of individuals, whose interest was to incentivize the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhibitors, once they traveled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as lhan guides as a defensive. Upon entering, Howeuer, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for there were few members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were floating by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by the echo report of the safety cannons. Iri an inclnt their guards had left them, and, pushing behind the rocks, had begun to sneak in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example, joined each other for one morning behind the corner of the defjle: but shameful six-year-old thus held by an enemy, who with the irisultant low baye lhcm advance, and being exasperated without resistlng slclvghter, is one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they have decided both to rvsb forward in the sea of the enemy. Barely lost shelter from the r0ck, when Lord Ruthven took a bullet back into his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer attentive to the c0ntest or to his own peril, he takes hold of him by seeing the faces of the robbers around HLM, his guards having, on Lord Ruthveri's wounded, thrown their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey foon encouraged them to transport the wounded friend to a nearby hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrancc until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for wbich had a fiery one. Lord Ruthven's strength decreased considerably; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of the pain if he had been objects about him: bul towards the end of the last enirig, his inirid became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who urged him to offer his help more than usual solicitude—\"Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I watch out for the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you can save my horror, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I don't know much, my Iife ebbs apace, I can explain everything, but if you hid all y0u kriow from me, the honor rny was free to stain in the world's moth, and if my death was unknown for a time from me in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"-\"Swear!\" shout the dying mon, Raisjng himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul resent, by all your fears of natvre, swear that for a year and a day you will not imprison your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way whatsoever, what happens or what you can see. \"The eyes of Hjs seemed shaken by their bases: \"I sweclr!\" said Avbrey; he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the circumstances rnany attending to his knowledge of this man arose the spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he snored the presentimenl of something horrible waiting for bim. The ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hovcl in which he had first the corpse, when a thief the mel, and insorbed him that it was no longer there, having been transmitted by the hirnself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the pirinacle of a near mourice, according to a promise which they gave badly to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the trot moon rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the mcn severcll, determined to go and bury it where it was. But when he reached the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clots, although the thieves swore that they were reporting the same rock on whicb lhey had laid the body. For a while, the mind was stirred up in conjectures, hut he finally came back, convinced tbat they had buried the corpse for the good of the clots.\nWeary of a country in which he met terrible misfortunes, and in the wbich all apparently consplred to increase superstitious shot melancholy who had seised himself on his inind, he resolved t0 to leave her, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While he was taking care of a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange thefects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case that continued to deny the seueral weapon of offense, more or less adapted to your following the death of vlctim. There were several daggers and ataghanf. As he killed them, and looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with the same style as the dagger discouraged in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to obtain furthor evidence, he turned the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eycians did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but they still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the sheath of haft and sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there was also a drop of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna and, on his return to Rome, his first incursions focused on the lady whom he did not attempt to capture Lord Ruthveri's sculptural arts. Hor parents were in distress, lheir farune ruined, and she had not been a hero since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's reindeer almost broke under so many repeated stalkers; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of thc 0f It's Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and bis only the occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the bone lift one he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, and the hicb seemed to obey his will, soon set him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a mummcrit, appeared at 1oso, in the embraes and caresses of his sister, all remembrance of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her afsection, now that the woman began to appear to you, she was even more attached glues a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have a winning tal who won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was noo of this light shine whieh onIy exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never lit by the lightness of the tbe mind below. There was a melancholic charm that hated him who was not a stage to emerge from mjsfortune, but from a certain tributary within, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not thal light foot, wbich wandererf wbere'er a butter or a color can attract — it was sedated and perishive. When Olone, her face was never brzhtheria with a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — the face was then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought by her moro guardians that his presentation should be dislodged until the return of his brother from the aspirant, that he could be his protector. It was now, i.e., resolved trot tbe next show, wbich was on fast approach, should be lbe era of his cntry in tbe \"busy scenc.\" Aubrey preferred that Havo stay in his father's house, and feed on the overcrowded melaricholy wbich bim. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mirid had been his torn by the uniforms he had hid windnosed; but he decided to thirst for his own comfort lo his sister's protectori0n. They soon arrived in town, arid prepared sor tbe noxt doy, whicb had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was in excess, a room of drclwirig had not been held for a long dull, and all those who were anxious to rest in the smjie of the kingship hurried there. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner near Hesolf, without mingling around him, he engulfed in the rem brance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, and a voice he recognized t0o well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your 0ath\". He had had little desire for tvrn, fecrful of seelng a spectrum thclt would explode it, when he perceives, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this spol from his first entry into society. He looked at Lill's lirbs alm0st refusing to carry the weight of lbeir, hc was forced to lay the arm of a money, and forcing the crowd to passoge throvgh, he shook himself in his car, and was driven hammed. He passed the room with rushed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that bis thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—the circumstances began in the dreadsul—the dagger—the oath bis.—He awakened him—\nHe himself could believe that he might be able — the dead are still resurrected! — He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for although he tried to ask worried Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his ljps, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close raid. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he bound himself in a corner, arid there engaged in his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when many were leaving, he shaved his back, and entered another room, and found his sister surpassed by many, apparently in a serious conversation; and he tried to pass the training approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed these traits to him, he was most horrified. Hc went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her to the street; and at the door he took the crowd himself as servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again this voice whispering beside him: \"Remember your oath!\"\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more fully was he absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again prevailed over his thoughts. Hissister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she begged him to explain to him what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and these terrified beers. The moro he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this moron to gratify, bearing rvin on his breath, in the midst of all that he had of gold, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been touched by Bim. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would encroach on his own hand to free the world from evil; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his way, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his beating, to take possession of nature. Finally, unable to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from street to street, anxious to steal this imago that haunted him. Hls's dress became neglec ted, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humidity. He wasn't a loriger. He recognized him, and returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where the fictigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, deployed people to follow him; but they soon carried away from him who fled a pursuer faster than any — from thovght. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a siend among them, of the presence of which they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into the sciété, and to look at him closely, anxiouf to the fore-behind, despite his oath, all wborn Lord Ruthven approaches with intimacy. But when he entered lnto in a room, hls hclgard and suspicious appearances were so strikirig, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was the last time forced to beg for him abstclin srom in search, for her, a society that aspired strongly. When, blindly, the demonstration proved to be unavailed, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated by the bocomiririg, they thought it was very long to resume that truft whjch had been imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the irjuries and sufferings he had every day oncovntated lnbis wandering, and os preventing him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they consider to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible suhject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was confined to his room. That's where he's lying for days, unable to wake up. He had fainted, his eyes had splashed a glazed chandelier;—the onlysjgn of the remaining arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid ar ar arid arid arid arid arid arid ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar a \"Oh, touch him at the riot, if your love for me is strong, don't come near Bim!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only ancestor was: \"Truly! True!\" And again he sank into a ftatc, from which it was not evcnshe could roam bim. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and its mlnd threw a part of its morosity, while its guards observed, tbat severol tlmes the day he could have put himself on his fin-\nHe has a precise number, then he smiles.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards in his room, Bogari to converse with his doctor on the melancholy oreconstance of the beirig of Aubrey in such a horrible situation o, when if sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Avbrey attracted the attenien waf; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, of which they feared that he had been depraved, they mentioned the name of the Count af Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count he had met in society, Avbrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sistor. They didn't take it, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his smi1e lovoli; for he pressed hcr to his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears of wet mind, flowing to the thought of his brother being more cllive to thc feelings of affection. He began to talk with all the hls w0nted heat, and to eangr attest him to his marriage with a perfon so distinguished for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of inonster who had instilled his life so long. He searched him in a paroxysm of rclge, and trampled him under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of the future husband er, he looked as he did not understand her, then seized her hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of face, he told her to swear that she would never marry this moribund, for being—but he could not advariate—it seemed as if thot voice made her remember her oalh—he turned abruptly1y, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meclntime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and yet it was only a return to his disorder, entered, and the forcing of Misf Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, begged, and cried out to delay them, but for a day. They attributed this to the madness that they were jinaginning had plowed the possession of his spirit, overtaken to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the show, and Hod Heen refused with all the others. When we heard about Aubrey's health, he stopped right away. But when he found him mad, his exultation and pleasure might be against those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his pagan? His tongue had dangcrs and toils to tell—could speak of him solf af of an individual having no sympathy with any heir on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed;—could know how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not about that he could listen to his saotbant accents;— well, he knew his how to use the art of the serpent, or this was the will of destiny, that he won his imperfections. Tbe litle of the eldest hranch falling long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriag e, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the coritinenl.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was he who givoned him; he wrote a letter to his fisher, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hope and the hope of him, to delay but for a few hours this marriclge, on which he denounced the inost of heavy curses. The servants promised that they would devour him; but givlng to the doctor, it is better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. Night passod 0n without rest t0 occupied prisoners 0f tho home; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can more easily designed thari described, notes of occupied preparatian. Morriant came, and the noise of the chariots broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants took hold of their uigjlance, they gradually seized it, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with an affair was ovt of the raoin, and at a moment fouridhim in the apartmerit where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was madly perverted; he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by the sorcerer, rushed him out of the room, without a voice, with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and if my sling is not today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to bis servants, who, awakened by the old lady, had a camo looking for her. Aubrey no longer supported himself; his rage found no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This waf did not mention to his sisler, who was not present when he enlisted, as the doctor feared to shake him. The death was celebrated, the bride and husband left London.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the close-to-dental approach. He wanted the guards of his sisler to be called, and at midnight he struck, he reported what the reader struck, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Avbrey; bvt when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven hcld disappeared, and Aubrey's sieve had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where his resting place shone, and Providence his guide.\"\nOn board the Greek Archipelago, aboard one of the Majesty bis ships, in the year 1812, we place inlo tbe port of Mitylene, on the island of this dwarf. The beauty of the p1ace, on the certain supply of cattle and alwoys vegetables to have there, prompts many Brilish ships to visit it — the two men of war on merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the shjps linked to Smyrna, they premiums largely refund for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed, as usual, at the b0ttom of the bay, and while the meri were employed to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the nectivas, the clergy and I took a t0 thccave ramle called Homer's School, and other plaoes, where we had been before. On the front of the Ida (an upland smalI)\nCule s0 named) we met and hired a Greek vorig as our guide, wbo told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He came to me like a pil0t,\" said the Greek, \"and he took me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am 1ikely to marry.\" He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, making the river, belongs to him, and he left ari old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not eonsantly; so he sails in his felucca very often to the various jslands.\"\nThis story exacerbated our curiosity very mueh, arid we lost no timo in haste at the home where the Uvr countryman had resided. We were delighted by an old man who condvexed us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: light green walls, mclrble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountiri under, whooh could be made to play your game through the branches by moving the spring cl fixed on the side of a small bron2e Venus in a posture of leanjng; a large sofa or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall slood a half dozen English cane chairs, and a library cmpty: there was n0 mirrorf, rior cl unique painting. The hodchambre had only a large carpet plait spread on the floor, with two qvllts of stuffed cotton and a pillow – the common bed in all Greeco. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think aurselvos justified to examine the content. On the recess tablet are Voltaire's, Sbakspeare'f, B0ileau's, and Rovsseau's w0rkf complete; VoIney's Ruiris os Empires; Ziminerman, in German; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, anItaliani cditlan, prin ted in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets in the Greek press in Constantinople, torn mucb, 6th no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in italan and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribulated all the way, and my rke with paper underwear 0f, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man of Tbe said: \"Tobe lord had read these books before he sailed, arid forgot to place them with others; bvt,\" he said, \"they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that if I moved nothing without order, he would frown me for a week together; he is olherways very gaod. One day, I did him a favor; I have the gift of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty two chinas that I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and that the first brigyl here from Adrianople; I do not know for which rcason.\"\nThe appearance of the outside house was pleclsjng. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greclan's architecture), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, with a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, on which the Greeks spend their evenings in fmokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma cbristi\", eating fruit, and enjoying evening hroeze.\nOn the left strip, as we encumbered the husc, a stroamlet glided awoy, the grapes, oranges and lime gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large 6ush blues, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, thc 1ord spent many of his cvellri gs and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, wrltjng, and speaking to bimself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very crazy, that he had always left our chvrch twice a week, bcsides Sundays.\"\nThe uiew of this seat was what we can call \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo mount Calcla, covered with oliue and myrlle trecs jn flower, and on the top of which ari ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A srall stream slit the ruins in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, arid a borizon not eclipsed by a cloud of fins, tormjnat the view in fronl; and a little on left tip, throvgh a victual of high and palin-trees chesriut, several small islarides carried distinctly obferved, sparing the light blue wave with emerald green af spots. I liked a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the namo of the pcrson who resided in this r0mantic solitude: no one knew his dwarf but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I am furious, he will not say it,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I won't dare.\" We had not long visited the Armenian, but on 0ur return to the towri we would bend several parliculars of the secluded lord. He shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with thcmat pouptiol feast. He put a cow to a man, hares to others, cotton and silk to the girls who live with these arties. He also bought a new boal for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to p0ar children. In short, he seemed to us, from all that we co-elected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance comes to us, which our old friend at the c0ttage bought cleanly so as not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a plano-fortus, and had taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with whieh we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations everything on the rack, guessing who this ramhler in Greece could bc. He had money, it's obvious: he had philanthropy of deposilion, and all the lhose eccentricities that mark the peeuliar genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our dovbts were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the archic, a student of WYATT'S, who had been a traveller in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, about wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, arid I also saw him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we have been a few years frorn house; cabin \"Child Harolde\" beirig put in our hands wc recogriized tbe recluse of Calcla in each page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious iri our research with the cottage, but we c0nsaled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day wil nevcr back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of her seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been portrayed as an unshakeable provision, contrary to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add his pleasures. The fact is the opposite, as can be seen in these anecdotes. All the finest feeling of the heclrt, so praisefully portrays iri the poems of his seigneury, seems to have the most seat in his bosom. Tenacity, sympathy and charity seem to guide the actions of Oll Hjs; and his wrath of loneliness is an additional reason to scam him as a being upon which the Religion sealed his heart, and upon whose head the Volunteer threw his coat. No man can read the \"characteristics\" of plcasing until he feels proud of himself as a castingman. As far as his love or plcasurcs are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with caution, especially when directed against the moral integrity of man; and he dares juftify luiflf before owfvl tribal where all must appear, only can censor the errors of another-morl. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. For good in dryrel, and to escape the applause of the world, is the furious testimony of a virtuous and self-proveing connaque.\nTHE END\nGi1let, Printer, Crown Court, Fleot Street.",
    "8": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE fumestition vpon that this story is fovnded is very general to the East. Among the Arabs, it seems common: it did not, however, oxtend itself to the Greeks until asterizing the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it gradually acreafod, arid formed tbe subject to many narcotic looks, still in progress, of tho death rjsing of their tomb, and to feed on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, ail ovor Hungary, Po1et, Austrla, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres soaked at night some of the bl ood of their victims, who became camaciated, lost their strengtb, arid quickly died of oansumtions; while these human blood suckersfclttenod — and their veins becamo distend to such a slate of repletion, so that the blood fl0w fr0rn all passages of their body, and even vcrypores of thoir skins.\nIri the London Journal, of Mclrch, 1732, is a curious report, and, of course, credible if a particular case af vampyrism, which is frozen for having taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the masters in place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth out of the tomb of the Vompyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, abovt twenty or thirty days after his death and buricll, many people complained of being tormented by him, arid a repository was made, that fov pcrson had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove even more inische, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as is plentiful to be usual iri vampyrism coffees) sresb, enclnd entirely free of corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid charge. As the evidence was obtained, he resorted to the usual remedy. A logger was all through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is a reporter for shouting as if he had been delivered. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre heseIf, and sucks on his TV.\nA judicial officer.\nThis tade rodomon m0nstrous is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a sort of punctuation after death, for a heinous crime committed that exists, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to confijne his infernal visits only to those whom he loved most while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by tjes of arid affection.—A fupposition alludes to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from her tomb; then, haunting the place of origin, and sucking the blood of thy seed; from thence, the daughter, the sister, the woman, about midnight drain the stream of life; Yel hates the haunch that performeth thy living corsus, thy vitims, They will still expire, and they will know the devil to be Heir sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest him, thy flowers wilt on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the greatest beloved of all, Shail blesses you with the nclm of a father— Word of thal shclll envelops your heart in flame! Yet, you have put an end to your task and marked the last tiring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see Who freezes his blue without lifo; Then with the tear of the hand without Halloween The braids of his yellow hair, 0f which, in life, a lock when the thorn The tenderest plcdge of affection has been worn—But now is corned by the memorial of the thiary agony! Yel with your own best blood will flow; Tby grinning tooth, and hcng-\nGo--and with the ravines of Gouls and Afrlts, until those in horror distance themselves from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful peein of \"Tbalaba\", the corse vclmpyre of the Arabic mclid Orieiza, wbo is represented as having turned from the grave for the purp0se of tormenting him She is most loved during her life. But this oan must not be supposed to have resulted from the sincss of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and ineriocence. The true Taurnasort gives a 1ong count in his lraves of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in hjsgreen work upan thls subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put far some learning dissertations, tending to prove that it is olassic, as well as barbarial error.\nMany crunchy and interesting naties on the singularly horrible superstition migbt be added; although present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necossorially devoted to explanatian, and which can now be coricomposed by merely pointing out, that the term Vampyre is that in foam general acceptance, here are feverish other synonyms with it, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vrocol0cha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, BrovcoI0ka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe would strike that, in the midst of the dissipations attacrating over a winter of Loridon, a noblemon appeared to the various parties of the ton leaders, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his attenlion, that he migrated by a glance calming him, and throws fear int0 those breasts where the unconscious reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain when it arose: some the attri6cd with the dead grey eye, which, staring at the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, at a glance, through your heart's inner work; bvl fail on the cheek with o ray lead that wigbed on the skin it could not pass. His peculia laughs made hiin be invited to each house; cll1 wanted to see it, and those who had been subjected to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly dizziness of her face, which never climbed a warmer hue, eitber frowned the bluffh of modesty, or the strong emotion of passiori, although her shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after natoriate tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some wbat ranks that they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of all the Shewri monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, the horse hair on the way, and made al-I put on the dress of a mauntebarik, to attract her attention:—although in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apprivoly fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived;—everi her impudencc inappalled was stooped, and shc left the fiold. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidance of his eucs, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. He had, h0wever, the reputation of a winning torigve; and if it was that he even overcame the road of his singular characler, or that they mocked his oppressor hatred ostensibly vice, he was as osten among those women who boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as among tbose who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time he came to London a gentleman yovng named Avbrey: he was an orphari left with cln only sister jn the possession of grcatwealth, 6y parenls who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by guardians, who thought that it was just necessary to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind in the ear of the subalter ns mercenary, he cultivated more his tban imagination his judgmont. He had, Herice, thal high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so many apprentices of thousand. They retrieved everything to sympathize wilh vlrtue, and thought that the vice was lhrowri by Provjdence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misory of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, whoh were also warm, but which were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was handsomo, frank, and rich: these reasons, at the time he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striulng who should describe with the least truth tbeir languishing or farfelu favorite: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he was burning, and by their sporkling eyes, that he opened his lips, soon led him into notions falsifying his talents and his merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, exoep in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there had not been foundatlon in the real life f0r none of these congreries of pleasant photos and descripions contained in these volumes, srom that he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, ho was abovt to return to his dreams, wben tbe extraordinary being that we described above, crossed hiin in his career.\nHe observed it, and the very impossibility of forming a jdea of character of cl man integer1y absorbed iri hiinself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avidance of the c0ntact mind: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to exdravaganl ideas, he soon fermod this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to hide the progeny of his fantasy, rather lhan the person in front of him. He got together with him, paid attention to him, tied up so far in advance, that his presence was recognized from the slides. He learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and so0n found, from the preparatlon riots in — Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had deliberately sharpened his curiosity, he bathed at his guardians, that it was late for him to persevere in the tour, which for many generations has been deemed necessary t0 to allow young people to take a few quick steps iri lhe career of vice towards puttirig thesesIves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appeor so fallen from the sky, whenever fcandal0us intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or prayer, agree to the degree of competence he had to carry them 0n. They agreed; and Aubroy, speaking of his intentions to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive a proposal from him to join him. Flattened by sucb a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the other mon, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circle of galleys.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he has fovnd, that, although much more hif actions were cxposed to his point of view, the results have offered different oonclusions of the movies apparent to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his freedom; — the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from the hand bis more than enovgh lo relieve their immediate needs. But Au6rey could not avoid pointing out, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to iridence by the misfortunes even sitting on virluus, that he gave his alms; — these were sent to simmer the door with sneezes barely repressed; but wben tho profligato came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him slill deoper in bis iniquities, he wcls sent with rich charlty. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importunity of the vicious, which generally prejudged the retreat bafhsulness of the virtuous needy. Therc was a circumstance abhorring the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those on wbom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the 1 o west and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the shaded cities through which they passed, Au6rey was surprised at the apparent impatience he had towards his oompanion for his vice in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable fact, with which he usually dragged tbe sciety around: he was not, however, so when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without the air of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes sparked with the m0rc fire only if the cat dilated with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that attracted him to the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes of the silent hungry children, revealed himself a single distant from his late immonistic wealth, where with even buying enough to satisfy their present desire. However, he did not take money fr0m the table of play; but immediately lost, to the rujner of many, last guilder tbe he had justnatchcd of the convulsive take of the innocent: this could but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capclble os counselling thecunning of the experience more. Aubrey often wanted to present him to his friend, and begged him to resign that purity and pleasure wbich proved the ruin of all, and did not bring him to his own profit;—but he delayed jt—for the day eabb he hoped bis friend would give him an opportunity to speak fra nkIy and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven iri's car, and in the midst of various wild scenes and lleh of narration, was always the sclme: bis oeil spoke less than his lip; and although Avbrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, to be obtained no grelor gratuitislcation from him than the excitation convoking vainly desirejng to crush this mystery, which to his exalted jmagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a last time, saw his companion; he left him in daily attendance up the morning circle of an Italian countess, as he wept in search of the menorlaux of the almost deserted city ariother. He was thus engaged, letters came from Engla nd, he exhaled with impatience; his sister's first waf, breathing only from affection; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in the companion bis, lefo seemed to give hlm svfffice reason for belief. His gvardians instilled on his immediate departure from his friend, and urged, that his character was terribly vicious, because the passion for irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. He had been discouraged, that his contempt for adultery had been caused by a riot in the hatred of his choractre; 6vt that hc hod demanded, for enhaneo hif gratlfification, that his victirn, the associate of his guilt, should be precipitated from the pinacle bone unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the femas that he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, finco his displeasure, pulpered even the mask, and had not led to denounce all the deformity0f their vices to the public gclze.\nAubrey determined on leavirig one, of which the bad pas Yel characler showed a single luminous pear on which the eye rests. It res0lved lo invents plausible somc prelext for a6andlng hjm quite, purposing, in the wbile meon, to look more closedc1y, and to let na light circonstnces go through unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his seigneury was tending to work on the inexpireee of the lady's daughter whose house hc mainly frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; therefore be obliged to listen to her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and quickly discovered that an assignati on had been clpoirited, which would end the most iikely in the ruin of a jnnoccnl, although girl without thought. Losing his time of rio, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, abruptly asked her his intentions with respect to the lady, insorring him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet his shot the same night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were svch as he all thought havc on such an occasion; and over six years in a hurry that he sought to marry him, he simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riot, to say that fr0m that time, he had to refuse to take over his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother af the lady, informed out of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The assignment was pre-verified. Lord Ruthven sent his servant to notify you of his complete consent to a separation; but do not doubt his plans hclving beeri thwarted by Au6rey's interposition.\nHaving lefl Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, soori found himself in Athens. Ho Tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and the soan took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, were ashamed to tell the acts of free men only before the slave, had hidden them under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same razor as he, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that fhe could have formed fashion1 to serve a painter desiring to pour on canvas the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she might be among those who had no souls. As shc danced on the plain, or truffled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazele a type of poar of its beauties; for who would have excavated his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, f0r this luxurious 1ook sleep of the animal adapted but to the tasto of an epicuro. The slight scarf of Ianthc Osten accompanied Aubrey in his search for onquiities, and often the dishonest girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere 6utterfly, would show the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind to stare at her avidly, wbo forgot the letters he had just decrypted on a tclblet almost erased, in the contemplation of her sylph figure. Osten would drop her braids, while she was wilting, displayed in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, she could well exercise the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from her inirid the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try descrjbe ehclrms that all feel, but none can appreciate?—He was the innocent, youthful, and beautiful, vn affected hy bond-drawing rooms and choking the balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to preserve the memorial for his future, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of the bis pencil, tracing the scenes of his nativc place; she would then describe to him circing danee on the open plain, painted, to him in all the glamorous colors of youthful memory, he docked p0mp sho remembered having seen in his childhood; and then, turing your subjects that bad ovently made o groater impression on his mind, told him al1 the supernatural tales of his nurse. And often as she told him the story of the living vampyre, which he had spent years in the midst of his amif, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, feeding on the ljf of a washed female to prolong his existence for the following months, his blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh out of idle sucb and horrihle santasis; but Ianthe quoted him The names of the old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of their loved ones released and children had been found marked with the buffer of his appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe it, for it had been, noticed, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had a given proof, which forced the ind, with sorrow and heartbreak, to confess it was true. Sho detailed to him the traditional appearance of the monsters, and his horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; he, h0wever, stiHe perfided by persuading her, there would not be true in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had tended to excite a belief in the natural pilgrim power of Lord Rvthvcn.\nAubrey began to linger more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtes...\nHe laughed at the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek gjrI without instruction, still found himself more and more attached to the almost magical sorm before him. At times he was tearing himself from her, arid, bewitching an antiquarian witch research plan, he went away, decided not to return to his object was reached; but he always found impossible at six his attention on the ruins around him, while iri his mind kept an image that seemed to alono the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Iclnthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same childish Francoist binge he knew first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her fauourite haunls, that her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a whieh fragment had escaped the time of the destrvtive hand. She had applied to her parents on the Vampyres svbjeot, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold HLM for a few hours; when he heard the place nclme os tbe, he all begged one of him not to come back at night, for he had to necessarily break a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had ciosed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent upori the one who clinged to cross the Jr road. Aubrey inade lighl of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; bul when he shuddered them to his audacity so as to mock himself with a superior power, iridiferal, tbo the same name of what apported their frozen blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey osfed on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that the words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had infused them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the faithfulness of his horse, and he earnestly begged him to remember it. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not realize that the light of the day was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those toads who, in the climates of war, rushed so quickly into a huge mass, and poured out all their rage upwards of the country devoured.—He, however, finally ascended his horde, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fetes, the night begins: and cre it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely a resting interval — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the eanopyant falching, while the forked blue lightnirig sowed to fall and radiate to its very sight. Suddenly, the horfo became afraid, and it was carried with sharp dreadfuI through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the g1are of lightning, that it was in the tbe quarter of a hovel tbat hordly lifttod himself from the masses of dead leaves clnd brushwood that was surrouding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city of Tbe, or to get away from the storm to get it. As he approached, the Lunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a smitten woman with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in the almost uninterrupted anne; — he went on; but, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the mourning of the hut. He found him in the darkness; but the sovnd guided him. Apparently he was not received; for, though he dared, the sounds continued, and no notioe was taken from him. He found that he no longer heard any talk with anyone, that he had seized a force that seemed superhvman to him: determined to sell his life as expensive as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw a huge force against the ground: his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled his breast, laid his hands on his throat — when the glorification of many torches entered the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the bronches, while he was breaking in the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there; ond Aubrey, incoherent in moving, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered; the highl of their torohes fell on the mud walls, and the torch began to sow on the undivided straw with heavy soot flakes. To Aubrey's desire, they would hold on to her, who would have attracted her with strange shouts; he again left himself in the darkness; bvl whal was her horror, when the light of the torohes flashed to her once again, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor burned in a corso without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vibe from his troubled imagination; but he agairi saw the same form, which he did not close, strangled by his side. There was no eolour on his cheek, even riots on his lip; yes, there was a silence on the ber's face that seemed almost as endearing as the lily that once lived there: —upori his arid breast nek was blood, and on his throat out were the marks of the teeth that opened the vein: — to this men pointed, crying, simultaneously suffocated of borbor, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A lilter was quickly sown, clrid Aubrey was bewitched by the slde of his wbo had recently been he obie tbe and so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life tbat had died in her. He knew that n0t wbat hls pensions werc—his mind was randomized and seemed to run away from roflect, and take refuge on vacation—he held unconsciously iri hjs hand a nakcd dagger from a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were soon welcomed by different parties that had been engaged in the search of her that a mother had missed. Their lainentclblc wept, as they approached the city, announced the pclrenls of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe that the child's death was impossible, but when she showed the causo of the child's death, he looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were inconsolable; bobb died in broken support.\nAubrey being put in the water had a very vlolontic fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he could have appealed to Lord Ruthuen and Iantbe — by an inexplicable comination, he seemed to be begging his former companiori to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses in his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthuen, had the opportunity at this point to arrive from Athens, and from what reason evcr, on the support of the tho state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same havse, and became his constant atlerant. When the latler recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whose image he now had with that of a Vainpyre; but Lard Rulhueri, by kind words, jmplying almost rrperitance for the favlt that had oaufed thoir separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care whieh that he showed, soon reconciled to the presence bis. His seigneury seemed astonished; it did not appear that the apathetic bcing which had so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, to be gradually retired irito again the same state of mind, and Avbrey perceived no difference from the old mcln, except that sometimes he was surprised to incl his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not kriet why, but this smile shone him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of the lhose orbs, circllng, like our world, the still suri;—indeed, he seemed to have wifh to avoid the eyes of all.\nAuhrey's mind, by this eyebrow, was greatly weakened, the arid elasticity of the breath that had once so distancized him now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of somiludc and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought in the midst of the ruins ho had been trainedly frequented, Ianthc's forin stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in quesl of the modest violet; tben suddenly turned around, how, with his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all of which have created such assailed in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his misfortunes, they had to visit the parts of Greece, and they had not yet seen him. They went in all directions, and searched for all places where a memory could linger; but although they hastened to set up, they did not seem to hold what they were looking at. They heard a lot of r0bbers, but they gradually began to look at these rep0rts, which they imagined to be on the inveriti0n of ldividuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those wh0m that they defended frorn so-called dangers. As a result of negIecting the advice of the inhabltants, they traveled once with only a few guards, inore to serve as guides as defense. However, at the time of the formation of a narrow dew, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks brought d0wn of neigbbourant precipices, they had reafon to repent of Jr's negIigence; for it was horrificly the whole of the TB party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near the head to befall, and by the echo ratio of several cannons. In a tbeir inserting the guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the Camc report. Lord Ruthvon and Aubrey, imitating the example of the Toir, demanded behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but grieved to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, moved them forward, and to be exposed to slaughter without violence, if one of the robbers had to climb up and overturn them in the back, they decided 0° to rush in search of tho cnome. As soon as they had lost shelter from the rock, Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which led him to the impound. Aubrey hastened to be besieged; and, no longer taking into account his own porile, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his Havlrig guards, on Lord Ruthven's detour, immediately threw away his arms and furs.\nBy promises of grcat reward, Avbrey soan encouraged them to put his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after hanging on to a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are content only with guarding the entrance until their comrade comes back with the promised sum, far away from where he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strerigth declined rapidly; in two days, arid death followed, death seemed advancirigous with hasty steps. His oonduc and his appoaranco had not changed; he saw as an unconscious of pain as he had been objocts about him; but towards the end of the last evening, the bis spirit became apparently uncomfortable, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced to offer his help wilh plus lhan ordinary serious—\"Assist me! You can save me—you can do more than that—I don't mean iny liise, I've listened to the death of my existence as little as the inclt of the passing day; but yov can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do something ari,\" Aubrey replied. \"I made little noise, I can't explain everything, but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was frec in the mouth of the world, and if my death had long been unknown to Englclnd—I—but life. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying girl, raising HLMSE1f with a strong vigour, \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature, that for one arid year a day you will not give your know-how of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, which can hclppen, or what you can see. \"His eyes seemed inflamed with their slippers, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he ran down and laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge with the man arose on the hif mjnd, and it was not known why; when he was taken up with his oalh, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the present, something horrible were waiting for him. When a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer the thero, Hovirig was transported by himself and his comrades, at his retirement, to the top of a nearby muneau, according to a promise he had made to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took several of the men, determined to go and bury him at the place where he was. But when he moved to the top, he found a trace of the body's clothes or ortho, although the thieves swore that they had reported the identiccll rock on which they had misposed the body. For some time his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally reopened, convinced that they had buried the corpse because of the clothes.\nWeary of a country that he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to absolute this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resisted to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship at Coriuey Hiin in Olranto, or in Naples, he was organizing these effects with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing febrile weapons of offence, more or more lcs adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and ataghans. While turning them back, excluding the curious forms, what was his surprise to sin a coat apparently adorned in the sty1e sarne as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get further evidence, he found the weapon, and horror can be imagined when he discovered that he mounted, although particularly shaped, tho sheath hc he1d iri his heel. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at bc bound to the dagger; yes again he wanted lo disbelief; but the particular shape, the same varying shades on the haft and sheath were oexil in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on hls wcly homo, in Rome, bis first investigations were about the lady of Tbe whom he had attached to snatch of the seductive arts of Lord Ruthuen. Her parents were in distress, the jr f0rlune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. The bee of Aubrey's spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that Tbis Iady would have a victim at Ianthe's destr0ycr. He became inorose and silent; and his only occupation was built up by exhorting speed beyond the postllions, as if he were going to save the lily of someone he held asleep. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soori called him on the shores of the Eng1ish; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, arid there for a Millel, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached cls an oompanion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winning grace that won the gauze and applause from the salon assemblies. There's been noo of this slight hemorrhage that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was always illuminated by the leuity of the mind below. Tbere was a melancholy charm about him, which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but snored a feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which went astray where a butter or a oour might be attributing – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed in his affection, and forgel in his presence these sorrows shc kncw sanitized his rest, which hclve exchanged the smile hor for tbeuoluptuary tbat? It seemed that these eyes, the face of the shot, played in the legion of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and nat bcen had introduced to the world, having thought more by his guardians that his presentation should be delayed until the return of his tbe bra countering, when he could be his protector. It was now decided that the next show, which was approaching, should be the era of the Ber e ntry in the \"busy fcene\". Aub rey would have preferred to remain iri the home of his fathers, on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not take an interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit had been torn apart by the eternity of which he had witnessed; but was determined to sacrifice his own spouse to the protections of his sister. Tbey soon arrived in the city of iri, and prepared for the day noxt, which had been announced as a salon.\nTho's crowd was excessive — a living room had not been welded in a long time, and all the toilets were anxious to rest in the semi-bone royalty, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was sneaking alone in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, he undertook to remember that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded iri's ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre would explode, when he perceived, at a certain distance, the same figure that had drawn his nazi to this place when he first entered society. Ho looked until his limbs were almost refusing to beat their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and forcing a pclsage into the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He grabs the room with pressed steps, stares his strips on his head, as if he were asrajd his twoughts were burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances dried up in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He mocked himself, he could not believe that this was possible — death rose agajn! — He thought his evil iinaginatiori was conjuring the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for although he intended to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung up his lips, and he had no opportunity to win the insormation. He went a few nights later with his sister the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he removed the jnto for a break, and there he gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he woke up and entered another room, found the sister hjs surrounded by seueral, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, wben one, whom he asked to die, turned around, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took hold of his arm, and hastily forced it to the slug; and at the door of Tobe he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to pass over them, he heard again the voice of Tbat whispering beside him, «Remember your oath!»\"He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, he soon picked up his house.\nAubrey bccaine almost got distracted. Is before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much m0re c0mplctely was he absorbed, now that certainly af the living monster again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, arid those who terrified him. The inority he gagged, the inority was perplexed. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this biter to wander, 6earirig ruining on his b roalh, in the midst of all that he loved, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would deploy his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had been derisory. For days he remarried in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his fist came, which, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he was no longer able to carry the sti1lty and loneliness, and left his house, wandering from street to street, anxious, stealing this image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the sun of no0n-day as the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; he finally threw him at dawn the rcst where fatigue surprised him. His sjster, anxious for his family, empoyed pe0ple to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled faster than any pursuer, in the same way. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his obsence tho all his friends, with a fiende omongst them, of the presence of which they were ruthless, he decided to enter again into the society irito, and to watch him close ely, anxious in advance, despite his hearing, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his hamburger and his distrustful look were so striking, the inner chills so visible, tal his sister wos finally forced to beg him to refrain from looking for a sockety for his fako that touched him so strongly. However, when the remorstranee stopped, the guards thought it was good to interfere, and, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they thought it was very important to regain that trust that Aubrey'f's parents had previously imposed on them.\nDesirous bones erasing him from the wounds afflicting the suffering he had daily encountered in his wandorings, and to prevent Birn from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be hay, they instructed a doctor to reside in the house, and to take constant care of hlm. Hc hclrdly seemed to notice, so that completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that ho confined himself to his room. He is often able to wake up for days. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a brilliant 1st time; — the only sign of affection and memory remaining appeared vpon the entrance of the hif sister; then he began sometimes, and, by licking his hands, with eyes that severely affected him, he could have decisire ber not lo toucb him. \"Ob, don't touch him; if your wing for me is great, don't harass him!\" When, above, she asked who he was talking to, her only answcrwas, \"Truly! True!\" And he hit himself in a state, from which he couldn't even roll it. Tbis lasted a lot of months: gradual, however, as the year wos passing, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and his mind threw osf a part of them glooin, whjlst his gardensobserved, thal several times iri the day he counted on his fingers a defined number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubrey's situation, while his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately attracted; hc anxiously asked whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, whose they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name af the Count of Marsden. Thinking of a young count whom we had met in society, Aubrey felt happy, and amazed even more by his intention to express himself to the nupils, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister inspired him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to the chest hjs, and kissed his cheek, wet grims, flowing to the thought of the being of his brother orrice more alive the feelings of affection. He began to speak wilh ail his wond hearlh, on to congratulate hor for his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and each eoompljshrnt; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, which is his surprjse al see the features of the monster that so long badly influenced his 1fee. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramples it under the idiot. On her asked him why he thus destroyed the tbercs emblem of his future crow, he looked as he did not hear it — then by grabbing his hands, looking at ber with a frantic excrescence of face, he made him swear that she would never marry that assembler, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice reminded him of his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meraitime, the guard and the doctor, who had kept everything, and thought it was only the return of her disorder, entered, and Miss Aubrey's witch, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees, implored them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this madness which they imagined had taken possession of his mind, adeavovred to pacisy him, clnd retired.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after drawing-ro0m, and had been refused with all the others. Wben heard of Aubrey's evil hupp, and understood himself willingly to be the cause of him; but when he bound up with him, he did not know what he was doing.\nIndeed, he was considered to be lnsane, his exultatiori and his pleosure could hardly be conceoled fram those whom he had spoiled this information. He hastened to the housc of his former companion, and, through constant attendance, and the claim of great effect for brotherhood and interest in his destiny, hc gradually won Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to rocount—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the mad earth, except with her to whom he added ressed himself;—or could say how, as he knew her, his existence, hadbeguri to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accesses;—in flne, he knew so well how to vex the art of ferpent, or such was the afate will, that he gained his affections. The title of the eldor branch falling at length to hjm, he obsessed a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marjage, (in craving of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continuous.\nAubrcy, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, erasing him, as she appreciated his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grove, who held him in their arms as the arid hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servclnts promised Thoy to deliver him; bul giving him the doctor, he thought he no longer harassed Miss Aubrey's spirit by, who he comforted, tbe ravajngs o maniac. Night spent without resl to the busy jnmates of the house; and Aubreyheard, with o horror that mcly more easily be designed than described, occupied preparation notes. The morning came, and the sound of the cars br0ko vone his ear. Aubrey grew up almost frantjc. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custadus of an old woman without shame. Hc seized the opportunity, with a bath was the oul of the room, and in a rnocnt was found in the bearing where all were gathered. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, ond, taklng hls arms by force, bim pressed from the room, fury without voice. Wheri on the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered to Iri his ear—\"Remember your oath, arid knaw, except for my fiancée on a day-to-day basis, your sister is dishonored. The horneri bow is frail!\" His saying, he pushed him to the servants of hjs, who, awakened by the old wmon, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; the riot of arrogance discovered vengeance, had broken a blood vessel, and they carried him to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not pregnant when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The mclriage was sold, the bride waved and the husband left London.\nAvbrey's weaknesses are increasing; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He desired the custody of his sister, and when the hour of the night rang, he reported in a composite way what the speaker had perpetuated, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was above all, where to choose the resting place of the bis, and Providence its guide.\"\nEN Sailing through the Archpclago of the Recien G, aboard 0ne of the ships of Her Majesty, in the year 181z, we put in the bravery of Milylene, in the island of this name. The beauty of this place, ond the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, lead many British vefsels to visit it — both warren and merchants; arid though jt is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed at the galley, and the stock exchange negotiated for the cattle wllh the ncllives, the cIergymclnarid myself took a ramble in the cave called H0mer's School, arid other plaoes, where we had seen 6 before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and erected a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio witb a Lord Engllsh, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"clnd took me with him; bvt I made riol choose your leaving Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good renan. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he forgave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and resided the obout fourteen months, but not constantly; f0r he sails in his felvcca very often at the djfferent is1ands.\"\nThis acetont excited us very much, and we did not lose any tjme in haste in the house where our peasant had resided. We were graciously rewarded by a man, who led us to the monsion. It is composed of sour apartments on the entrance hall grourid-fIoor—ari, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a stunning clofe attached. They were decorated with a sirnply: plairi green-stained wails, tab1es ori marble on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small oven underneath, which could be made for p1ay through the branch by moving a spring fixed on the side of a sinaIl hronze Venus in a lean poftvre; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the hal1 were held thals cl dozens of English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor one painting. The 6th bedroom can only be a large mattress on the flower, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, common bed throughout Greece. In the living room we observed a recss of marble, sorinerly, the old man told us, filled with books and popers, who were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the cl0sel: it was open, but we did not think that our jackets justified by examining the contentsf. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltclire, Shakespeare, BoiIeau, and Rousseau the complete works; the Ruins of Volney os Empires; Zimmerman, in Gcrman language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the Nouels of Kotzebue; the plcly os thc Robhers of Schjller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several brochures of smclll of the Greek press in Conslantinople, many native, but no eng1ish book of any dot. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latiri. The Mefslah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with pclper briefs, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The first had read books of tbeese in the evening before he sailed, he forgot to place them with others; bvt,\" he said, \"he must lie until his return; for he is so special, that I have been to move a thing without order, he would sling on me for a week together; otherwise be very good. I did him a favor once, and I made the product of this farm for the trouble to take care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought hcre of Adrianople; I do not know why roas0n.\"\nThe external appearance of the house was pleasant. The frorit partico was five steps long and fourteen broad, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, overwhelmed by a lig ht story bcllustrade, was covered with a turkey carpet flanked under a strong coarse linen awning. Most houso-tops are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wlries, such cls \"laohryma christi,\" the fruits that graze, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hand of lefl when we entered the house, a small strcamlet gIided away, grapes, oranges and lime were grouped together on its borders, and vnder the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with ari arnamenta1 wooderi dos was p1aced, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"The idea,\" said the old man, \"was praying, for he was very fervent, and he always attended our church, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seal was what can be called \"a bird's view\". A liria of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cave of olives and myrt trees in bloom, hung on the top of old whioh ari The Greek temple was similar to the majestic decay of iri. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until Jt was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as glass, and the horizon ari urishadod by a cloud slngle, Finish the view in frorit; and a little to the left, through cl vista of noble hazelnuts and polm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding tbe light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unanswered as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, wbo hod went to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our C0nductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he's nal,\"—\"And canniot yov say, old fried-\n\"If I can,\" he said, \"I dare riot.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we leave some details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when ho was the last vpon on the island, and evcn danccd with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to the old man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these things. A1so bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek tests to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, according to alI wo collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent cabracter. A circu instance we learn, that 0ur old friend to the cottage lhoughl proper not to reveal. He raised a very beautiful girl, with whom the Lord was seen on foot on the sea, and he had bought her a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the inf0rmation with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; 0ur imaginativesall on the rac k, guessing who this creeping in Greece or being. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arrived at Palermo, the doubts of the dawn were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a pupii of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individuala1,\" he said, \"about whom you are his anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travers ontho est1 and Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as wo had been a few years fr0m home; but \"Childe Harolde\" beirig put in our hands we recognized the truer af Calcla in every page. Did we not regret not being curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the tho idea of returning to Mitylenc ori on a future day; but inside that day will never return. I make this statement, I think it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court at the right nclmc of its 1ordshjp, which has been grassy clumsy. It has been described as a disposition of sensation, on the contrary if one associates human nature, or if one wants to appease his pains, or add to his plaidsuros. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be plclinly gathcred of these litlle anecdotes. All the more sinister feelings of Tbe's heart, so elegantly represented in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tend-\nRnosis, sympathy, and cabality seem to guide all bisactjons; and its court of solitude is an additional reason to mark the bim as a being upon which religion sealed its heart, and on which voluncy has eaten its inant.\n- Yes. No man can read the previous \" traits\" without feeling proud of the bim as a peasant. Wilb respects love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with coutiori, in part when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify his words before this tribal awfuI where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lard Byron's choracer deserves his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the wold, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-opposed consciousness.\nTHE END\nGi1Iet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-strcet.",
    "9": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very fanciful in the Eost. Amang the Arabs it seems to be your comrnon: it has not, however, spread over the Greeks vntil after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only clussum its presenl form since the division of the Latin arid Greek churches; at this time, the idca becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the biood of the young and beautiful lhe. In the west, it spread, with a little variati0n, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, Lorraine, where the belligerent existed, which the vampyres soaked during the night a certain portiori of the blood of their victims, who emancipated, lost their strength, and spiediIy died of consumption, while these human blood suckers fattened, and their veins distracted themselves to such a state of repletion, to cause the blood of all the passages of their blood to flow, and had even porques of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary, is o curious and, from covresus, a credible one. It seems that, in an exarnination of the commander-in-chief and the magiftratos of the plaa, they declared positively and unanimously that, about five years after\nore, a cerlain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hcard lo to say, that, in Cassova, on the froriticers of the Servia Turkjsh, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing it with his bl0od. However, this precaution did not prevent Hirn from becoming a vclmpyre heseSi; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made that four priests had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove furthcr evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as is Suppased to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitage to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they were subject to a personalized remedy. A splash was pushed erirely tbrough thc heart and Arnold Paul's body, al., it is reported to have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. Thif did, he cut his head off, burned his body, and threw the ashes into the bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the cors de cesperfans who had previously died of vampyrisin, lest they in turn become agenls vpon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampy even a vampy himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis rodomontad incontrosity is here related, because it seems better odapted to jllutrate the subject of this ohservatjons than any 0thcr instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, f0r a heinous crime committed while it was in existence, that the dececlsed is not only condemned to vampyrise, bvt forced to entrust infernal visits only to those bracts he loved most on earth, to whom he was bound by kinship and afsection.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre: then the place of origin shall be scorned, and thou shalt suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight shall drain the streom of life: yet hate the banquet that is to feed thy living corse, thy victim, and Ere lhey, and exhale, know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, and cursest them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But whoever for your crime must fail, the youngest, the best loved of AlI, will bless Ihee with the name of a father—This word sball envelops your heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must liven up who releases his lifeless blues; then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of whlch, in life a lock when the bottom of Asfection plcdge was worn — But now is horno away from you Memorial of your agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy teeth gnashing, and thy lip wreaking; then, hunting toward thy sulten tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afritf rave, Tlil the self in horror shrinks awcly Of the blind spectre cursed that they.\nMr. Southey hos also irtroduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned to the grave with the aim of tormenting him, she loved better when in existence. But this cannol being assumed lo resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout history as a type of cornplete type 0f purity and innocencc. The true Tournefort gives a long acemount in his journeys of several amazing cases of uampyrisin, to which he claims to have been a cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great upori work this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrates esfects, presented some learned dissertations, tending t0 to prove that it is a c lassic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and intrepid opinions about this singularly horrible superstition are added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a nat, necessarily devo-\n, and which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that the term Vampyre is the most general aooeptation, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the worlid: like Vrocolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe learned that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, he appeared to the various parties of the island's leaders a nobleman, more noticed for his singularities, than for his rank. He looked at the glamour around Hiin, as if he could not participate in others. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his intention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and sink into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this sense of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the fao of the object, did not seem to penetrate, at a glance to pierce through the inept wheels of the heclrt; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to be invited to each house; all desired to see him, and tbose who had been accustomed to the violatory excitement, and now felt the weight of the ennul, were happy to have something in presence tbeir able to engage their altesse. Despite the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer hue, eithor of the blvsh of modesty, or srom the strong emotionality of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, mary of the hunters femalo aftercr notoriety atlempted ta gain his attontions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might call emotional: Lady Mercer, who had heard the mockery of all the bloody monsters squeezing her mooring, threw herself in her way, and djd all bvt put on the robe of a montebank, to draw her attention:—but in vain:—when she st0od before him, although her eyes wcre apparently fixed on hor's, it still seemed that they were not understood;—even her impudence uriappalled was overflowing, and she left the field. But if the comman adultress could influence even the guidance in his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to the hive: however, this was the apparent prudence that he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that he never spoke to few women. He had, however, the reputation of an irritating t0ngue; and that he wef even overcome the fear of his singular characler, or that lhey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, being also often among the women who form the boclst of their sex as domestic virtues, as among those who jostly him by Burmese vices.\nAboul the samctimc, the era came to L0ndon a gentleman of your name Avbrey: he was an orphan left with a single sisler in possession of great weight, by the parents who died while he was alive. Allowed to benefit also by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortvne, while they took over the most important charge of his mind in the custody of the subalterns mercenclry, he cultivated inor his imagnatlon lhan his judgment. He had, therefore, this high feeling of honor ardent, which every day ruins so many thousand apprincipes. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the violence was thrown away by Pr0vidonce simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he learned that the misery of cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the peer's eye by irregular folds and various combed patches. He thought, in the end, that the poets' declams were the raïons of life. Hc was handsomo, frank, rich arid: for these reclson, at his entrance into gay circles, many mothers furrovnded hjm, slrivating who should linger with the least truth thoir larigating or snoring favoritejtes: beats at the same time, by their brilliant faces when to be approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he quickly led to notions fcllse of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was t0 the romance of the hif solitary hours, he was surprised to discover, that, except in the tallow and the caridles wox that sparkle, not the presence of the tbe of a ghost, but the lack of sriuffing, there was rio foundation in the real life for clny of these congreries of pjctures and pleasant descriptions contained jn these volumes, from which he had f0rmcd his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary belng we described came across him in the bis career.\nHe tossed it, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in bimmoine, who gave few other signs of his observation of the oxternal abiects, lhan the tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: to allow to imaginative hif of pictvre each thing tbat has undermined his propensity to extrovant ideas, he quickly formed this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to observe tho progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid him attentlons, and s0 well advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recogrified. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's business would be embarrassed, and soon wild, from the notes of preparation iri — Streot, he was about to travel. Wishing to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, hod only whend his euriosjty, he suggested to his tutors, that it was time for birn t0 to make the tour, which was so necessary for the young to take a few steps rclpid in the career of vice to get on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to cling as if fallen from the sky, which never scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasant or praise, according to the degreo of competence carried in the portage lhem sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, were surprised to obtain from HLM a proposal lo Jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of estemm srom him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it glodically, and in a few days they had passed the waters cjrcling.\nUntil now, Aubrcy had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, that, although many moro of his act...\nHe was presented in his view, the results contradicted different conclusions of the reasons apparent to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubreycauld did not avojd remark irig, that it was not on the urgent, reduced t0 indigence by the malfortunos allentarit even upward of the virtue, which was granted hjs aums; — these were sent from the dorm with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came for osk something, not to relieve his desires, 6ut to allow him to revalue in his lust, or to sink him still dip in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charjty. It was, howover, attributed by him to the rigorous imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virulent indigent. There was a circumstance about charity if his Lordship, whob, was even more impressed by his spirit: cling to those on whom he was granted, Inevitably found tbat there was a curse on her, for they were al1eith er Ied to the scaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other bassoons by which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his campanion seized the centers of all the vices in fashion; tberc hc entered the spiral of the faro tclble: he bet, and alwa ys gamb1a successfully, except where he knew more sharp was his clntag0nist, then lost himself even more thcln than he won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with wbich ho generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, it was not, he encountered the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a nocre family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more firo than shot of the cat that would deliate with the half-deod mouse. In all the cities, he left the once rich yauth, torn the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the splendour of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this fiendre; while many fathers sat frantically, in the midst of the airs speaking of hungry children, without a single petbing of his immense latet wealth, whenwith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediatly lost, for the ruiner of many, the last guilder hc had just pulled himself out of the convulsive grip of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the cvnning of the most experienced. Avbrey 0ften wanted to represent this to bis friend, and bcghim to resign this charity and the pleasure that proved the ruin of all, arid did not take to his own profit; — but he delayed it— although every day he h0 his friend would give him an opportunity to spaking frclnkly and opo nly to hirn; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven jn his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification than the constanle excitement or vainly wanting to break this mystery, which to his exa1te imagination begari to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his companion; he left him every day in the morning circle of a Countess of Itallan, as he went in scarf in the anniversaries of the almost deserted city. The letters came from England, which opened eagerly; the first came from his sister, breathing riots, but sprinkling; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had grasped the imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough rcason for the helif. His guards immediately infused his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, so that the possession of irrosistible p0wers of soduction, bjs rerided bjs 1 habits more dangerous for society. He had been disembodied, that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the haste of his choracter; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, starting from his guilt, shoovId Id be thrown from the pinacle of unsulniated virtue, to the bottom of the abyss of the infamy cld degrclation: iri fine, which all the thase females he sought, apparently because of their vjrtue, had, since his departure, even sunk the mask apart, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of the tbeir vices to the pubic gaze.\nAubrey determined on the leavjng one, whose choracter had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a p1ausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposjng, in the way while, lo watcb closer, and not to let pass any slighl cjrcu instances without attention. He entered the same circle, and so0n perceived, that bis Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he had mainly friqueriled. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried female to be encountered in society; he was therefore forced to pursue bi plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, although there was nothing to say. Losing rio time, he entered Lord Ruthven's estate, and abruptly asked the lady for her intentions with rccspect, irriforming him at the same time that he knew that he was about to do it that night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were such that he would all have had such an opportunity; and after being presscd-\nHe intended to marry her, he just laughed. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing o note, to say, tal from that moment on he must refuse to accompany Hls Lordship in the remajnder of their pr0posed tovr, he arded his servant to look for other apartments, and call the lady's mother, informed her 0f all to be known, riot only with regard to his daughter, but also regarding the character of hls Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven sent his servarit to riot his full consent to the separation; the hut had no suspect of his havirig plans was defiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey dirocta bis headed for Greece and Orosa the peninsula, soon found himself in Alhcns. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon took over himself by tracing the erased documents of the old gory on apparently monuments, shameful to chronicle the acts of sreemen only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichen. Under the same roof, there existed a being, so beautiful and so delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful in Muhammad's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much of a spirit for someone to think that it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plclin, or stumbled along the side of the sheep, oria would have thought of the gclzelle a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of the animated natvre, sar trot sleopy luxuriovs look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his research antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, would show all the height of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, lo the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just decrypted a tahIet almost offacod, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. Otteri wanted his braids to collapse, by freaking around, expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, he migrated wol1 excuses the oblivion to the anthill, which leaves the very object that he had before tangbt of vital imporance to the pr opor intcrpretation of a passage in Pausanias in his mind escclpe of his mind. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but black con appreciating?—It was innovation, beauty and indignation, without being affected by crowded ro0ms and stif1ing bailels. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep an affectionate during his working hours, she stood aside, and he took care of the rnagic flaws of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his harmful place; she would describe to him the circular dance upwards 0n thc ploin open, w0uld paint, lo he in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects who had obviously made a great impression vpon his mind, w0uld tell him all the supernatural talcs of the sheepfold. Her fervors and the apparent bolief of what had been there, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and after as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her frjendf, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by nourishing the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence later the following months, her blood ran cold, while being tempted to laugh at her ovt with so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of them, close to parents and children, had been found marked by the stamp of the fiend's appetite; clinging when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to beautify him, for it had been noticed that those who had deluded to question their existence, had shown a somo, which forced them, with grief and hearing, to confess. She detailed to him the troditorial appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise discription 0f Lord Ruthven; he, archiving, limon persisted in persecuting her, tal could not be truth in the ber fears, although at the same time he wondered to them any coincidences that evil all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey Hogan to become more and more attached to Iarithe; innocence, so contrasted with all the emotional virtues of the women among whom hc had sought for his vision of romance, gained the heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English clothes, ina rying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself even more attached to the almost magical form of mistreating him. He at times torn himself from her, and, relying on a plan of some anliquarian research, he went away, tortured his object, which he had reached, so as not to return vntil; but he still found it impossible to focus attention on the ruins of Tbe araund to him, while in his mind he retained an image which seemed to be the sole owner of his trick. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was eucr the same infantile frarik being that he first had kriown. She always seemed to separate herself from him, but it was because she didn't have someone with whom the sbe could visit hcr hantf favorite, while her tutor was busy sketching or discovering a fragmentwhioh had escaped still destructive tbe harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several Presenl, affirmed their existence,despite the horror of the very name. Soon aster, Aubrey determined t0 proceod on one of his excursions, which was to keep him f0r A few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no reinain Greek evcr, after the day had closed, on any c0nsiderat ion. They described it as the resorle of the vampyres iri their night orgies, and bare the heaviest evils against him who dared to cross their way. Aubrey's unfailing light of their representatives, and tried to pull TBem out of the idea; but when to be seen the in shudder to his dairig so to mock a superior, unfaithful pagan, whose very name apparently made tbeir bIood freeze, he waf silence.\nThe next morning, Auhrey set out on his uriattentue excursion; he mocked serving the melancholy face of his host, and he was conned to discover that his words, mocking the belief of these h0rrible fools, had infused them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Iantbe came to the sidekick of his horse, and sincerely begged him to come back, the night passed allowed to put into action the power of these beings;—he prosternized. Hc was, however, so busy in his research, that we did not see that the daylight was coming to an end soon, and that in the borizon there was one of those spots which, i.e., warmer climal, so quickly assembled in an atrocious mass, und poured the anger of the Iloir on the devoted land.—He finally, however, m0unted horse, decided to reborn by the speed for his delay: but he was too loti. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sets of svn, begins the riight: and ero it advanced poorly far, the power of the storm of Tbe was above — its thunders failing had barely a resting interval — its thick beak rcliri forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning of Tbe seemed to fall and radiate at its own feet. Suddenly, his horse shook, and he was carrified by a draconian rapidity through the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, was kindled, and found, by the glare of thinning, that he was sweeping in the vicinity of a hovel lhat barely rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that overcame him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one for the gujde to me, or the least confident to get a shelter against the storm of Tbc. If he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let bim hear the terrible cries of a worn mingljng with suffocated mockery, exulting with a lavgh, continued a sound almost intact; — he was surprised; but, awakened by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with an effort of svdden, forced the daor of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He apparently was not perceived, because, roughly, he called, always the eoritivized sounds, and no waf advice taken from him. He found himself in contacl with someone whom he immediately had fun; when a uoice crashed, \"Again bafflid!\" to whom a loud laugh succeeded; he felt struck by onc whose strength seemed superhumari: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from the bis feet and threw with a huge force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself vponned, and kneeled on his chest, had put his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hiin; — he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, struck the door, and iri a momeril the crushing of the branches, as broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there; arid Auhrey, incapable of movin g, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered; the light of their torches fell from the walls of vpon tbe mvd, and the tip loaded on each individual straw with heavy saot flies. At Aubrey's decision, they were shaking for the one who had attracted Hiin by his thunderstorms; ho wos again left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again on hlm, to perceive the aerial form of his liver oonducer brought a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a visiori coming from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same farm, when ho closed them, strangled by his side. There was no elour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence in his foe that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat had bows of teeth opening his vein: — to this men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many visions of brighl and fairies, now fallen with the flower of lily that had died the wilhin. He did not know what his tufts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and takc refuge in vacaricia, he held almost unconsciously in his hand a dagger riaked of a pclrticular construction, which he had found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who wrongly searched her, which a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the cily, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their gricc would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the dcathe of their c hild, they looked at al Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were jnconsolable; both died in the heart of a broker.\nAubrey boing put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; iri these intervals he would appeal to LordRuthven and Ianthe—by an incompetent combinotlon he saw to beg his former companion to spare the heir whom he loved. At other times, he permeated the evil-doers at the top of the pearl, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time that you arrived in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately put me in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter recovered from his dclirium, he was horrified and amazed at the sigbt of the one whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implicating aImast receptance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more so by the ottention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His seigneury was changed; he appeared no more than the belrig apathy which had so badly asloriishod Aubrey; but from saon as his convalescence began to accelerate, he gradually withdrew in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference of the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his staring staring at him, with a smile of maIici0us cxultati0n playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smi1e haunt him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to observe the tideless waves that the breeze cools, or to mark the progress of those or those 6s, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seems to want to avoid the eyes of He.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and the elasticity of the spirit that had distinguished him so much today seemed to have dropped forever. He was today like muoh a lauder of solitude and silence like Lord Ruthven; but, although he wished, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; is he sought in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Ianthe stopped by his side — if hc sought in the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; theri suddenly turned around, bathed, at hjs, the wild imagination, his palc face and his throat bent, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined t0 fly scenes, each of which has created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he had been bound by the care of the lender whom he had taken from him during his illness, that they visit the regions of Greece and that they had not yet seen. Thcy traveled in all directions, and searched for every place lo wbich a reissue could be attached; but although they hastened in this way from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what tbey looked at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the protended darigers. As a result of neglecting the advlce of the iris inhabitants, once they traveled only with birds, more guides your scrvc cls than as a fence. Upon entering, archever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, had reason to repent the most negligent; for there was hardly the whole party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistling of 6ullets cIose at their head, and by the echoed ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, complaining of hehjnd rocks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, in imitating their example, have for a moment eaten up the turning sheltered from defilement; but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with cries of irisult, told them to move forward, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, jf any of the shou1d thieves ascend ahoue and take thom in the reor, they decided onco to rush in search of the eriemy. He had scarcely lost the refuge of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a foam in his shoulder, which led him to the scratch. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking account of the contest, his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rulhven's wounded, immediately dropped their weapons and surrendered.\nBy the beginnings of agriculture,\nArd, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his rogue friend to a nearby hut; and having accepted a ransom, he was no longer troubled by the thorial presence — they were content to keep the anger until their comrade came back with the prammed sum, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly unleashed; in two days mortification followed, the arid diatb seemed to move forward with the rapid pace. His conduct and his taste had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his reindeer apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offer his help more seriously than usual—\"Help me! You can save me—you can do more than—I mean riot of my life, I heard the death of my existence as a bit like the one of the day passing; but you can save my hariaur, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" said Avbrey.\"I need to be lucid, but my 1 ive ebbs apace — I cclnnol explains everything — but if you want to make yourself heard everything you know about me, my hanour was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"-\"Swear!\" Crjed the man dyirig, rising with exullant vi0lence, \"Jeter hy all your sou1 reveres, by any nature y0ur feors, swecler that, for a yes or a day you will not in part be your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"-His cyes seemed to burst their slippers fr0m: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he mocked his pillow, and did not breathe rnore.\nAubrey rctllred lo rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that attended to his knowledge with this man r0se on his inind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath a chilling c0ld came from him, as if from the present something horrible awaited him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to escape the hovcl in which he had left the body, when a thief met Birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been transported by the swallow and the comrades, to his retreat, to the pinnacle of a neighborhood mountain, according to a promise they had given to his ship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that grew up after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him on the place where he was. But, querihe had climbed to the top he found n0 lrace ofeitber the corpse or clothes, thaughtho brabbers sworn that they indicated the same r0ck on whooh they had aided the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in conjectures, but he finally came back, convincod tbat they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terriblc misf0rtunes, and in wbich all plapparently conspired to increase this superslistic rnelancholy who had grasped his mind, he rcsolved to leave him, and quickly arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for an oonuey ship to Otranto, or your Naples, he took care to organize these effects that he had with him belonging to your Lord Ruthven. Among the other lhjng there is a café containing several weapons of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the date of the victim. Thero was several daggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and looking at these curious sleepers, what was his desire to find a horn ostensibly decorated in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastening to get more pro0f, he put away the weapon, and hishorror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, although particularly high, to the horn he held in his hand. His eyes saw that they did not need a certain fury, they paid the gazelng to be bound to the dclgger; but still he wanted to disobey; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the haft and sbeatb were similar in both splinter, and did not leave room for the doubl; there were also drops of good on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, the investigations of hjs fjrst were corcerting the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. His parents were in distros, their fortune rujn, and he had not heard of him since the departure of his seigneury. Aubrey's mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had fallen a life to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morfle and slender; and his only profession was iri exhorting at the speed of the postill0ns, as if he were going to save the life of a person whom he held dear. He came to Calais; o breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon hurried him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of the fathers bjs, and there, for a mother-criterion, seemed to lose, iri the embraces and edges of his sister, oll memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantish oarses, had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an eompanion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been motionless by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to emerge from mlsfortune, hut of a certain feeling inside, tbat seemed to indicate the conscious cl soul of a more brilliant kingdom. The Hcr stage was not as light, which goes astray where a 6utterfly or a color can attract – it was federated and pensive. When Olone, her face was never straightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother blew her emotionaljon, and shook in her presence those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, which bclve exonerated her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—this face were theri playing in the ligbt of their own natius sphere. It was still only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was bought by its guardians more appropriate than its presentation should be delayed v. the return of its brother from the TB continent, when he mjght was his protector. It is now, thoressore, resolved that the next salon, which was fasci approxxirig, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the mclnslon of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy lhc that gave him power. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; 6but he decided to sacrifice his own comf0rt to the protection of his sister. They soon came into the city, and prepared for the day of the nexl, which was announced as a drawing.\nThe cr0wd was excessive — a drawlng-room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smi1e de roycllty, seized it. Aubrey's over there with her sister. That he stood in a corner all by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time that ho had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in this vory placc—he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sovnded in the ear bis—\"Remove your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, searsul to pay for a tbat spectrum would explode, when he perceives, at a distance from litlle, the same figure that had attracted his opinion 0n spot thif when he first entered the society. He looked until his limbs resusjrig almost to carry their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm 0f, and forcing a passage through the dirt, he threw sons into his car, and was drlven home. He laid the room with pressed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would drink from his brain. L0th Ruthven kissed him once again — from the starry circumstances — the dagger — his oath. — He reminded him, he could not contain him — and he resurrected again! — He believed that his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real—to be determined, therefore, to go back to society; for although he had tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the narne hung on his ljps, and he could not sue for information. He went a few nights later with his slstor to the assembly of a ncor relationship. Levlng neither protected a matr0n, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself to his own devouring sighs. Finally seeing that many were leaving, he woke up, and entered the anothcr room, four times his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, whcn one, whom he asked of movc, turned, ond revealed to him the hc more a6horred traits. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a furious march, forced her toward the street; and at the door he took the multitude of the servarites waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged iri passed them, he agaln heclrd that the voice murmured by him: \"Remember thy oath!\"\"He did not turn, but, in a hurry to his sister, soon came to the house.\nAubrey almost got mixed up. If bes0re hisismind had been absorbed by the onc subject, how rnuch more completely was absorbed, now that the certainly of the monster's life again prostrated on his thovgbts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke a few words, and those who were terrified. The more he thought, the more children there were. His oath surprised him; — was he then for a monster lo raam of 1 lhls, carrying ruin on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his sister was hit by Hiin. But even if he broke his oath and discussed his suspicions, wbo would believe it? He thought of using his own group to free the world from such misery; death bvt, he remembered, had already been m0cked. For days he was born again in the state of Tbis; locked in the hall, being seen laughed one, and eaten only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his beating, to support the natvre. In Lasl, he is no longer able to carry calm and solidvde, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, anxious to steal the Iinage that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, the cls oflen were extinguished at the pleasure of noon as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used peas to follow him; but he was soon distanoé hy bim who0 fled faster than any frenetic thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all the friends bis, with a fiend among them, bone that the presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 to enter the society again, and look at him closely, anxi0us to farewam, despite his oath, to Il WHOM Lord Ruthven learned with jntimacy. But that he entered a room, his hamburger and his suspicious gaze were so striking, his inner thugs so visib1e, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that touched him so much. When, however, novelstrance proved to be unavailirig, the guards thought appropriate to interfere, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they had great time to regain that confidence that had previously been imposed upon them by the parenles of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had every day in wandering hjs, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye those who include of what they consjdercd madness, lhey hired a doctor to reside in the h0use, and take care of him coristent. He didn't like to notice him, his cornpletery was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence became at 1east so Greeklt, that he was confined to the upper chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He became ill emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and resuscitation remainedirig appeared at the entrance of his sister; then ho sometimes began, and, being his hands, with eyes that severely affected him, he wanted not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he resisted, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And once again, he sank into cl, even if she couldn't wake him up. The months lasted: however, gradually, as the year passed, the incoorences of hjs became less sequential, and his mind threw a part of the darkness of the spirit, while his guardians observed, several times in the day, he rushed over the fingers of a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, w hen, on the last day of the year, ono of his guardians ericing his room, began to converse with the doctor hjs upori the circumstance me1richoise of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to he married. Instant Aubrey's joy was coupled; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whom they feared he had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met with society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be prosent among the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. Hc was again able to be asphyxiated by the inf1ence of his beautiful smile; for he pressed himself to the chest, and kissed his cheek, with tears, flowing to the idea that his brother was once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all his warmth, and congregate it on his wedding wlth o no one so distinguished to cling to every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced a look on his chest; opening it, the whale was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster that so bad lorig infvented his life. He captures the portrait in a par0xysm of rage, and the trumple under the soot. On his askirig hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future hufband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing the ber's hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of face, he told him to swear that she wov1d never married the monster, because he—but he did not covet advarice—it seemed that this agclin voice made him rcmernber his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lard Rulhven was near him, but did not see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought tbis waf but cl relurn of his disorder, entered, and Miss Auhrey's forcing, wanted her to leave him. Ho fell on their knees, and irritated them, and begged them to do it one day. They, attributing this to the imagined TBey madness had prisri possessi0n of his mind, cndeavoured to the hirn pacisy, and rctired.\nLord Ruthven had ea Illed in the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with every elf. Wberi heard about Aubrey's ill health, he easily understood himself to be his cavsus; but when he learned that he was crazy, his exultatjon and pleasure could hardly hide from those among whom he obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former opulence, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great afferiori for brother and intereft in his destiny, he gradually wans the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His ton of dangers and labors to resign himself—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy for any being on the crowded earth, savc with whom he addressed himself;—could say how, since he knew her, existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if jt were simply that he could listen to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the wil of destiny, that he gained his asfections. The title of the branoh elder falling at his head, obtain an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hofteriing lhe marriage, (in spite of the disturbed slate of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to inherit the servants, but in vain. He asked for paper and pen; he gave him; he wrote a liter to his sisler, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the hon0vr af those who now in the graue, who once held her in their arms the hope and hope of their house, to delay but for a few hares this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, giving him to the doctor, he thought that Miss Aubrey's spirit should no longer be harassed by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmate of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that can be more easily designed than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally vanquished their vigilanoe, they stole it grccly, the leavirig in the cvstody of an old help woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and in cl mornt found sals in the apartment where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to percejve hirn: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him to snore the room, without a voice with age. When Lord Ruthven whistled in his ear on the stoircase, \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his ottensors, who had come to seek him, and were shaved by the old woman. Aubrey has no support langcr bimfe1f; her rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and it was passed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicjan was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey jncreased; the blaod efffusion produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and when midnight had struck, he presented himself in the form of a room that the reader persecuted, and he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guard shaved at protecl Mlss Aubrey; but when thcy arrived, he wcls too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's fissure had glutten the thc thirsl of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was all he was, he, where to choose his place of rest, and Providerico his guide.\"\nEN Sailing across the Greciari archipelago, aboard one of the ships of the majesty bif, iri tbe year 1812, we put in the port af Mityl-\nEne, on the island of that name. The beauty of this area, and the certain supply of olways cattle and vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it finds itself ralher off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We disembarked; as a vsual, at the bay jacket, while the men were used to water, and the handbag mingled with natives, the clergy and I brought rain into the cave called Homer's Scbool, arid other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we mix with a young Greek like our guido, and we said that he had come from Scio with a Lord Engljsh, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" sajd the Groek, \"and would have taken Mc with him; bul I did not choose to leave Mitylene, when I am likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good man. The house above the hi1l, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zcchinas for lt, (about L250 Englisb coin,) and resided there about f weteen m0nths, laough not constantly; for he sails in his felucca mery often to be different islands.\"\nCetacounl exacerbated our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose lime in the haste at home where our courtryman had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bathroom, with an attached closet. They were all simply decorated: wooden walls, marble table on each side, a large myrtlo in the center of the tob, and a small fonlain benetb, which could be played lo through the branches by m0 by vrombing a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a lean posture; a large cuuched sofa completed the furniture. In the hall were held a dozen chairs of Englisb cane, and an empty library: lrc were not mirors, nor a single painting. The bedding had simply cl large mattress lying on the fIoor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a paw – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble niche, f0rmerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whlch were then in the chest of a great sailor iri the eliset: it was open, but we didn't think we were just--\nIt is a question of examining the content. On the tablat of recreation are the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of V0Iney, Zimmerman, in the German Languagc, the Messlah of Klopstock, the novels of Kotzebue, the plcly of the Robbers of Schiller, the Paralife Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 18I0, several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Conslantinople, very torn, but no English book of descriptor. Most of the books of tbeese were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all the ove r, and marked with paper sheets 0f, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The first had read these books in the evening before he died, and he forgot to place them with the athers; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for heis fo particu1ar, that is, I would move a thing without order, he would frown me far a week t0gether; he is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; arid I have the product of this fclrm for the trouble to take care of it, except twenty zechins which I put to an old Armenian whore in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought to the house of Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the extcrnally house was plisirig. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were consjderably higher than the roof. Ro0f, bent by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey bandage, under a strong linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus irritated, for on them the Greeks pass their crazes by smoking, by drinking wines such as \"lachryma christi\", by eating frvits, and by taking advantage of the cevense breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees mingled together on its borders, the arid shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seat with a wooden baek of rnamenlal was placed, on which it is said that the Lord spent many of his evenings until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying for being was very fervent, and always went to our church twice a little, next to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a view of bjrd-eyc.\" A line of lcch vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into a broken waterfall, until it was the lowest in the woods near the basc of the mountain. The sea smoath in the form of g1ass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and an IittIe on the left, near a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islets have been distinguished, studdirig the light blue waue with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; bvt ovr requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but D0minick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armerian,\" said our conduct, \"could he say so, but I am sure he will not, \"and can you be let down, old friend?\" \"If I can,\" he said, \"I dare riot.\" We didn't have any lime to visit Armeniari, but on our return to the city we learned several particvlars from the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when being wos last upan lsland, and even daigned with them at the wedding feast. He gave acow to the mcln ane, horses to the otbers, and cotton and silk to the acorns who live by the weaving of lhèses articles. He bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greok Testaments to poor children. Iri short, it seemed to us, from all that we have chosen, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend in collage thought as it should be disclosed. He had o Mosl beautifulvl davghter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a plano-fortus, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing that it could be that tbis ramblcr in Greece. He had money, it was obvious: he hid philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nlrlcities that mark particular g enjus. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a puppy from WYATT'S, who travelled poorly to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, arid I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been the same year of the house; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put in our hands we recognized the reclus of CaIcla in every page. Didn't we regret not having 6th more curious in our research at the cottage, but we were oonsolated with the idea of returning to Mitylene ori somo tomorrow; but to me who will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not quite interesting, and in court in the right name of bis Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, inverse to association with nature humon, or contritullng in any way to soothe his eyebrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from lhcse small anecdotes. Al1 the more sinister sentiments of the earpiece, if elegatively represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to bave thcir sits in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his aotions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reson to strangle him like a beirig 0n whose Heart Religion sealed his seal, and on which hcad Volunteerism cast his prong1e. No man can read the pleasant \" traits\" of the precedig without feeling pr0ud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The deportations must always be the subject of a warning, especially when they violate the moral integrity of man; arid ho who dares to justify himself before this terrible tribulation where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and refraining from applause to the world, is the certainty of a virtuous heart and self-conscency.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eovrt, Fleet-Street.",
    "10": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam P0lidori\nTHE superstition on which this story is stuffed is very general in the east. Among the Arabs, it seems to be commori: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not assume its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek church; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in the territory Jr., it gradually increased, and sowed the subjeot af many wonderful stories, still existing, of the cd of elevation of their tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful1. In the West, it spread, with a certain variation of ligature, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the cxisled belief, that the vampyres soaked in harm by some part of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost the strength of tbeir, and quickly died of consuinctions; while these fattened human blood-svckers—and the veins of the air became dislinked to such a slate of repletion, so that the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even from the very porous babes of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a bearer, and, of course, credible at the expense of a particular caso of vampyrism, which is declared in havo took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems, that upari an examinatlon af commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they have asserted positively and without arid, that, about five years before, a cerlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, ori the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vclmpyre, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of the tomb of Tbe Vampyre, and rubbing himself with his hood. This preclusion, however, did not prevent Bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, in one person complained of bavingbeen lormented by hjm, and a statement was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attouches. To avoid other nrischics, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, taken the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be ufual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emjttirig in the mouth, nose, and ears, purc and flower blood. The Hauirig evidence was kept, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. This did, thcy cut his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the c0rses of these people who had previously died of vampyrism, lost, they should, in turn, become agents on others who have bred them.\nUniversal belief is, tbat a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and suck in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than another instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment that appeases death, for some heinous squash committed while in existence, that the doceased js was not condemned to vampyrise, but forced lo consine his infernal visits to these beings he bequeathed the most to the atrium — tbose to which he was bound by ties of kjndred and afseotion. — A supposition alludes to in tbe \"Giaour\".\nBul first on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, Tby corso will be praised from his tomh; then haunt the native piclce, and suck the blood of all your race; Tbere sromthy daughter, slster, woman, around midnight droin the current of life; yet hate the bariqvet that must feed your livid living corsus, Your victims, are still exhaled, Sha1l knows the domon for their sire; As you cursed, tbou the cursed, Your flowers aro wilt on the stem. But a little further your crime must fall, The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless You with the name of a father — Thal word will tear your heart iri flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of the eye, and the last glazed look must see who freczese o'er his life without 6lue; then witb without allowingcd hand fhall tear The braids of his yellow hair, of wbich, in llfe a lock that shorn the most dear commitment of Disorder has been worn—But now is carried away by lhee Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your nibble tooth and your harassed lip; then will you rush to your grau, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until this in horror frowns with a more ceremonial specter than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in hif wild bul beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is reprogrammed as havlng retourcd de lho falls in order to torment him she loved better whiest in existenee. But this cannot be supposed to have been the result of the finesse of her life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and insanity. The true Tournefort gives a long story jn hif travels on several amazing cases of vampyism, towhieb it claims to ensure that boen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and narratiusillvstratjue traditionalistic to its effects, has pvt ahead s0me learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as barbaric err0r.\nAlthough the term Vampyre is the most general acceptance, there are other synonyms used in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a winter of Londan, there appeared in the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, snoring remarkable for his singularities, that his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate in the three. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew only the attention bis, so that he could, by a glance, turn it off, and throw fear in those panties where the slap reigned. Those who felt this feeling of awo, could not explain from where it arofé: cared for it attributing it to the dead grey eye, which, extending on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce the thrugb within the work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of Ieaden that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His pecullarities made him invite in each house; all wanted to see him, hang on those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, arid now felt the weight of enriui, were pleading at havlng homebing in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly hue of the bis face, which never won a warmer tjnt, eilher of the hlush of modesty, 0r of the strong emotion of passion, softening her sorm and its contours were bavtiful, many women burgers after trying to gain her attention, and winning, at least, some wbat morks that could be described as affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the wick of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything except put on the dress of a mountain bank, t0 attract her noljce:—but in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it nevertheless seemed that they were unperceived;—evcris that her unheard of impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But even if the common adulterer could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not because the female sex was undifferentiated to him; but it was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuouf wife enthralled with innocent davghter, who knew that he was speaking to shmales. He had, however, the repudiation of a long hesitation; ond if it was even oercome the fear of his singular character, or if they were moved by hjs apparently hatred of vice, he was also often among those semals who make up tho boast 0f their sex of their domestic virlues, as among those who shove him by their vices.\nAbout the sarne era, a young gentleman named Aubrey arrived in London: he was an orphan left with a single sieve in the position of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortvne, while they took over the jmportant morc charge of his mind in the care of the inercary subalternants, he cultivated his imagination more tban his judgment. He had, therefore, tbat high romantic feeling 0f honor and caridour, which every day ruin so many Apprentices of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and yet this vice was thrown into 6y Provideanoe simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: it however that the misery of a collage mcrely consisted of clothing, which ch were like worm, but that worc better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the reo-\nLys of life. He was beautiful, frank, and ric h: for these reasons, when he entered the gay clircles, many mothers surrounded him, glorifying with the least truth their languishing or blushing fav0urites: the girls at the time sclme, by their brigant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his ips, soon led him to false notions of his talcs and his merit. Attached as hc wos to the romance of his solitary hours, it was started1 to find, that, except in the tallow and candles of thal clicked wax, not fram the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffing, there was rio foundation in the real life for any of these corigeries of pleosing images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed the study hjs. Faithful, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was abovt to relinqvish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, met him in the career of hjs.\nHe struck him; he had the improbability of forming an idea of the chclracter os my enjrely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his obfervation of external objects, lhan tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: all0wing his imagination to imagine all that flattered propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object into the hero of a novelist, arid dlerminé to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before bim. He has become familiar with him, has paid him slits, and so far has advanced on his pass, which his waf prenunciation has always recognized. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthven's fairs were embarrassed, arid soon found, flouting the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generals was thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the tho carcerof vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to let lhem t0 appear as fallen from the skjes, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of ability to carry them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently bad notbing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, orid in a few days, they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHitberto, Au6rey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he found, that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his vlew, the results offered different con clusions of apparent motiues to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; — the idle wanderer, ond thorobeggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey was not able to avoid sterling himself, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the miffortunef hadclent on virtue, which he granted hjs olrns; — these were sent into the door with sneezes barely suppresfed; but when the door of the deflll came to clutter something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Bim to harden himself in his chandelier, or to sink the hiin even deeper into his iniquity, ho was sent back with rieh charity. However, he attributed Thif to the importunity of rigging 0f the vicious, which prevailed over the abundance of virtuous indigents. There was one circumstance that escaped the charity of his Lordship, which was still innoored on the bis spirit: all those on whom there was hestowed, inevitab1y found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowost and the most abject miferous. In Brussels and other cities that they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent impatience with which bis compagne sought centres of all the fusbionable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the faro tclble: ho betted, and always played successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than being gclinated; bvt it was always with the same immutable face, with which he gazed gencraly at the society ar0und: it was n0t, however, if he encountered the eruption young riovice, or the son without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to come out of the law — this abstraction appeared from the mind was set aside, and his eye split with more flre thari than cat while dallylng wilh tho half-morte rnovse. In every city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle, he decorated, cursed, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the satc that had drawn him into the reaeh 0f this fiend; while many a father sat down, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his immense delay 1st, where with even buying enough for satissy there present envy. However, he did not take money fram the table of play; but immediately lost, for tbe ruirior de mony, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convuIsive catch of the irinoeerit: this could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commentevcr, capable of fighting the cunnirig of the exposed inore. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and beg Hiin to resign from this error and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and not teridlo bis But he delayed it, for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to walk openly and openly with him; however, it happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than the hive lip; and although Aubrey was near to his curiosity, he did not get more gratification of it than the constant excitement of vainly wjshlng to broak tbat mystery, which lo hjf exalted the begari imagination to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion for a while; he left him in daily assistance vpon the mornjng circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of memorials of another deserted city almoft. While he was thus risen, letters came from Englarid, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing something but affliction; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had already entered irito his jmagination that there was an evil power residing in his comporion, they seemed to give hiin enough reasons for belief. The guards insisted on leaving his friend, and urged, that his charclcter was terribly vicious, so that he possessed irresistible bone power of seduo-\nTian, made his licontiouf habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that his coritempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had required, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be shaken from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, all the thosc females whom he had had a bad soughl, apparently because of virtue jr., had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and n0t had scrupulously exposed all the deformation of vices jr to the publlc gaze.\nAubrey determined upori by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous p0int on which rcst the eye. He resolved to invent a plavable protext to abandon it altogelher, purposing, in the medium, lo to look hlm plus cl0sely, ond so as not to let pass light circumstances without note. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose house he especially frangled. In Italy, it is scldom that an unmarried woman be met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all the windings of hif, and saon discovered that an assignment had named bcen, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, although without thovghlle. Without losing any timc, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly attached his intentions to the lady, informing her to the same tiine who knew that bis was about to move her tbat all night. Lord Ruthven replied, that he had intentions such as he believed that all men had such an opportunity; and on the bejng he insisted on whether he intended to marry outside, only laughed. Avbrey retllred; and, in writing a note, to say, that from this mummcnt he must refuse to accompany hls Lordsbip in theremairider of their plan of visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and by calling to the lady's mother, inferring his bone all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthvcn sent his servant in effect so that there was no agreement on a separation, but the riots revealed that any suspense of his plaris had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Romc, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Tbe peninsula, soori found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the elevation of a Greek; and soon took possession of himself by tracing the fadod recordf of clricient glory on mariuments which apparently, assimilable to chronic acts of TB to free men only to be slaves, were hiding under the shelterjng floor or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as bjmself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that sho mlghl formed the model for a pajnter wanting to pour on canvas the pr0mized hope of fajthful into Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too mveh spirit far anyone at thjnk she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the pawn, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a poor lyp of her beauties; for who would have exchanged the eye ber, apparently the eye of the riature engaged, for this luxurious and slender look of tbe animal adapted but to the last of an epic. Ianthe's lighl stage often accompanied Aubrcy in his search for antiquities, and often there was a carefree girl, engaged in the pure oss at Kashmere hutterf1y, showing all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the 1etters he had just deciphered up0n an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. Dften woveldher tresses falling, as she wilted around, exhjbit in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and swjftly discoloring dyes, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before having vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but the norie can appreciate?—It was innocence, beauty, without being knocked down by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls1. He drew the remains which he wanted to keep for his future hours, looked at by, and looked at the magjc effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of his native plccce; she would then describe to him the open peain, w0uld paint, to him in all the colors gl0wing of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that obviously had a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales tbe of her nvre. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had passed through the midst of her friends, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong the existence during the moving months, her blood would be cold, while drinking of the laugh of so idle idle idle fantasies; but Ianthe citd à hi in the names of old meri, who had finally detected a living between them, after several of their close relatives had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fiend; and when she relieved her so unbelievingly, she asked her to believe that she, for he had been, noticed, that thase had dared to question their existence, had always had given proof, which obliged them, with grief and comfort, to confess that it was true. She stripped him of the traditional appearance of these walruses, arid his horror increased, hearing a descriptor of Lord Ruthven cautiously precise; he, commentcver, still porses by persuading it, that there could not be truth of inber fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a bliss in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthucn.\nAubrey began to cling more and moro to Ianthe; his innocuous, so contrasted with all the affected virtus of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of love, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying on the uneducated daughter Groek, he found himself even more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped himself off from the hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarlan research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mjnd he retained an image that only split the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same jnfaritile frank being that he hcld first kriown. She always separated from him with reticence; but it was of course she had no longer any ane with wbom that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy in fetishing or infiltration of a fragment that had still escaped the destructive band of time. She had addressed her parents on the subject 0f Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, a pole of horror al la narne itself. Soori clfter, Aubrey determined to carry out one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all both begged him nool to return to the neighborhood, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever be rcmain, after the day had closed, on any considerationjon. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in the night orgies of Jr, and denied the heaviest eules as imminent on the one who dared to cross tbeir palh. Auhrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when they saw them trembling at his daring tbus to mock a superior, infernal power, whose namo even apparently had the blood frozen, he was silerit.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and waf concemed your find that the words bjs, mocking the belief of these awful fools, had inspired them such terror. When he was about to talk, Iantho came to the side of his horse, arid implored aamest of him t0 relurn, ore nig ht allowed the powor os theseo bejngs to be put into actiori;—he promised. He was, however, so busy his research, that he made riot perceive that day-ligbl wantsoon fine, and that on the horizon there was one of the lhosespecks who, in warmer tbe cimates, so rapjdly gather in o enormous mass, and pour all their rage over the devolved country.—He finally, however, moved his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: bvt it was too late. The twilight, in these southern clmots, is almost unknown; immediately the sun runs away, the night begins; and he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above — his echo thundering bad barely a resting interval — his heavy heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning f0rked seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the entangled sarest. The animal lost, through the fcltigue, stoppode, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel lhat barely high of the masses of dead leaves and brush--\nood around him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to push him into the city, or at least have confidence to get sheIter from the storm pe1ting. As he approached, the thunders, for a silence of rnomenl, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who inflamed herself with stretching, exulting moekry with a laugh, continued in a sound almost without draft;—he was surprised: hut, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on the pearl, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was approaching...\nHe was not perceived; for although he called, it seems that he was anointed, and no notioe was takcn of him. He found himself in contact with an ori which he seized immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Always mocked!\" to which a loud laugh laugh laughed; and he felt him harassed by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: wet to sell his life as dearly as he could, he strangled himself; but it was in vain: And he fell upon him, and knelt upon his breast, and put his hand upon his throat, when the brightness of the torches ranny entered into the hole that lit the day, dislodged him.\n—he rose instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he was broaching through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now s until; and Avbrey, unable to move, was heard by those who were not. They stopped; the light of the hives fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each straw with large soot straws. At Aubrey's will, they loved him, who had attracted him to his cries; they were again licked in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tob burst even more, to perceive the aerial form of the beautiful conductor of hjs brought into a corsc without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a frenetic arisjng vision of his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by his sjde. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his ljp; but there was a silence over his faee which seemed almost as attached as the lfe that the Ance lived there: — on his neck and chest was bl0ad, and on his throat were the marks of teeth havlng opened the vein: — to this men poired, wept, struck simultaneously the spiritual horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was sown, and Aubrey was lajd by the sjde of her who had been lcltley at hjm lhe o6ject of so bright rnany and fajry visloris, now fallen with the flower of life trot bad died in the ber. He did not know that he was thinking of the whale, that he had a bloody mind and that he wanted to flee the reflection and take refuge in a vacant place, and that he held in his hand a bare dagger of a particle building, which had been found in the cabin. They quickly met with different parties who did not have a good time in their search for her that a mobber had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, told the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; hut when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and poirit à la corse. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubroy being put to bed had a more violent fcver, and was delirium 0ften; at these intervals he would otter on Lord Ruthven and high Iantho — by somc accounta6the combination he seemed to be beg of his old c0mpanion to spare the care he loved. At other times, he irritated the mollitudes on his hcad, and angered him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from what is motuué, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, he placed himself in the same house, and caused his dismay. When the latter recovered from sondelirium, he was horrified arid with the sight of bim, whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; 6ut Lord Ruthvcn, by his kind words, almost repentant irnply for the fail which had caused their separation, and still more by the attontjon, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; there appeared only apathetic twigs that were so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalesoence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew1y in the same state of mind, and Aubrcy perceived n0 different from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: do not know why, but this smlle flouted him. During the most difficult stage of the recovery of Tbe involid, Lord Rutbven was apparently committed to looking at the tidal waues removed by the cooling breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the sun without glaring;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of a1l.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weak eryed mvch, and this elasticity of the mind whjch had arice if dlstinguished it now seemed to have fled forever. He is now a lover of solitude and silence like Lord Ruthven; but many things he wanted for solitude, his mind would not find him in the neighborhood 0f Athens; if he sows it in the midst of the ruins that had once been fractured, Ianthe's shape stood by his side — if he looked for it in the woods, his slight step would get bogged down in the middle of the undergrowth, in the east of the modest violet; then turned svddenly, huddled, to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded face thr0at, with a sweet smile on his 1ips. He has determined to steal scenes, all of which have created bitter associations in the mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom ho held to him the collapse bound by the terider care he had taken from him during his illness, that they had to visit the ports of Greece had not yet seen. They traveled in each directjon, and looked for any place where a recollic could be attenuated; but although they so rushed into place, however TBey seemed n0t to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of the undivided, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the so-called dangcrs. As a result of lbus neglaot the advice of the inhabitants, or an occasion they travel with only a few guards, more sorvous as guidances tban as a defense. When entering, however, a narrative defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, wilh large masses of scrambled rock down the nearby precipices, they had resonated to repent of their negligence; barely wero the whale of the part engaged in the narrow pa s, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the repetition echo of several cannons. In a moment, the thorium guards had raised them, and, placing them felvos behind the rocks, had begun to fjre in the dilrection from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilati ng their example, retired for a while because of the apritirig turn of defilement: shameful hut to be held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, bade tbem advances, and being exposed to a laugh without resistance, if one of the robbers must rise above and take them to the rear, they dissuade both of the rusb forward in search of the enemy. Barely had he sheltered the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him the grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the thieves around HLM — his guards having immediately thrown their arms and furs on Lord Ruthven's wounded.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to pass on his wounded friend to a nearby rabbi; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their practice, merely keeping the entrance until their currency returned with the promised sum, f0r that he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly diminished; in two days the brittle mortification, and the diatb seemed to move forward with rapid steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; being as unconscious of the pain cls hc had been objocts about him; but towards the last night's c1ose, his mind became apparently vneasy, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was iridescent to offer his assistance with more serious usucll – \"Help me! Yov can save me — you can do more than that — I mean n0t life iny, I listened to death 0 if my existence is saddened like that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" said Avbrey.\"I need little, my ljfeehbs apaoe, I cannot deploy the wbole, if you hide everything you know from me, my h0naur was free to stain in the mouth of the wor ld, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweclr by al1 your soul resents, by all your nature fears, swears that, for a year and a day you will not lose knowledge of my orimes or death to any living being in an arian way, no matter what happens, or what you do not see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he laughed on his pillow, arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey relirod to rcst, but did not sleep; the many eircvmslances cltendjng bis accalntanee wilh this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; that he remembered his oath a cold chill came to us, as if of the presentation of horrible somcthing waiting for him. With his ear rising in the morning, he was about to bleed out the hoof in which he left the corpse badly, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was not the lrc loriger, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, vpon hif reliering, to the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that it could be expiated to the first odious ray of the interior that lifted up his death. Aubrey deafened himself, and took scveral men, determined to go and bury him on the place where he was. But when he climbed wrongly to the top, he found no trace of eiling the body or the clolhes, killing the sworn robbers they were pointing 0 on the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the body of Tbe for the soke of Tbe.\nWeary of a backstage in wbich he had mct with such terrifying misfortunes, and in whieh all apparently conspired to heigbten this superstitious melancholy that had grasped his mind, he resolved to hate her, and soon arrived at Smyr ria. While waiting for a vcssel to pass it on to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of securing the thase effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several offensive weapons, inores or less suitable for the execution of the vi ctim case. There were several daggers and ataghans. What did he do to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — hastenirig to get the furthcr proof, he flanked the weapon, and his terminal can be imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, though particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at being bound to your dagger; but stjll he did not want to believe; but the individual before, the celebrity voicing tlnts upan the haft and sheath were a1ike in the splendor 0ri both, and left no place to doubt; there were drops of blood of alfalfa on each.\nHe left Smyrria and, on his way home, al-Rome, his first investigations corroded the lady whom he had tried to seize Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, she had not heard of beeri since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almast broken under so mary horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen o victim of the deftroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in the urgjng the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to hatch the life of someone he held dear. Arrived at Calais, a brceze, who had seen his will, soon threw him in the English parts; and he hastened to his fathers' marion, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the shades and caresses of his sister, all memory of the CS's past. If before, by her infanline caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, shc was more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assembly. There was none of this slight shrillance that exists only in the heavycd atmosphere of a cr0wded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not see the birth of misfortune, bul of some feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter roalm. Her step was not that light that goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. Werialone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence those deed that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have changed her fury to that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played the light of their own natiuc sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been born, for she had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be dislodged by the return of her brother from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was now resolved that the next drawing-roister, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have denied staying in the house of his fathers, arid fed vpon the meIaricholy whicb dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashionable strangcrs, when his hcld spirit was so torn by the vents that he had witnessed; but he decided to make his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city of iri, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive, a living room had not been held for a long time, and all the wbos were anxious us to rest in the smile of royalty, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he threw himself into a bim, he entered the rememore that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in his place – he svddenly sei2od himself by his arm, and a voice that he also recognized us1l, sounded in the bis ear – \"Remember your oath.\" Ho hod bardly courage to turn, fearful os see a spectre that would explode, when he perceived, at a little distance, tbe sarne figure that had drawn his attention to this spol upori his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, arid forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would be inflamed with his brain. Lord Rutbven ogain before him—circumstances started vp in the terrible picture— the dagger — his oath. — He woke up bimbo, he could not believe it was possible — the dead are still resurrected! — He thought that his immagjnatiori had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; so long he tried to ask oncerning Lord Rulhven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in going the information. A few nights he went with his sister to the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recolon, and there he joined his own devours. Finally, seeing that many people were waking up, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass through and revive her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, ond revealed to him these traits that he most abborted. He took his sister's arm, and in haste he forced him to the street; and at the door he took the multitude of the servans waiting for the lords; and while he was taking care of them, he heard again that uoicewhifper dared him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but,\" said his sister, \"soori came to the house.\nAvbrey became a1moft djstractod. If, before the bis spirit was absorbed by a subject, how much more complete was he cngrossed, now that the certainty of the livjng of m0nfter has again pressed upon his thoughts. The attentioris of her slster was no longer heodized, and it was in vain that she inducted him to explain to him what had caused her sudden conductil. He spoke only a few words, and those who terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath was suffocating;—was he then to allow this monster thy roam, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and nat averted his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But evcn jf be to break his oalh, and reveal hjs svspicions, who would be in favor of hjm? He was thinking of using his own group to free the world from such misery; but Declth, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; he rose up in his room, saw no one, and ate on 1y wben his sister c ame, w0, eyes flowing with tears, bcsoughl him, for her, lo supporting nature. Finally, unable to support the arid solidide, he left his houso, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His robe was glazed, and he wandered, as detonexp0sed in the midday sun as at night's humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he put him dowri to rest where the fatigue spilled. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon far away 6th who fled from a pure fwiftcr than any – from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left all his frjends, with a fiend among them, bones whose presence was unconsclusive, ho determined to enter again into society, and waltz him closedcly, anxious to predict, despite his 0ath, all wb0 m Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his cursed and distrustful looks so striking, his anvils so visible, that if his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so much. When, how, the demonstration turned out to be unavailirig, the guards thought it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that the spirit would become foreign, they thought it was high time to regain that confidence which had previously been imposed on them by Auhrcy's parents.\nDesirovs of having saved him snort the wounds that he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prove him to expose him to the general marks of the eye of what they considered to be faith, lhey hired a physiciari to reside in the house, and took care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, so his mind was damaged by a terrible svbject. His inc0berencc finally became so big, that he was confined to his chamber. There he was often days, unable to be woken up. He became emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only remaining sign of effect and memory appeared on his sister's entrance; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to lick him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is to be, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" and agclin ho sank into the aslate, from where she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, as the year passed, its inconsistencies beeome less frequent, and his mind ripped a porlion out of his gl0om, while his gvardians observed, that several times in the day he cum on his fingers a defined number, and the smile of tuna.\nThe tjme had collapsed, when, on the last day of the Ycar, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister was goirig next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he anxiously asked whom. Happy with this return mark, because they feared that he had been deprived, they insinuated the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he had met with jn socjety, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sistor. They responded to the riot, but in a few minutes his sistor was with him. He was apparently again in a position to be affected by the influence of his smile; for he pressed her to the bis breast, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the mind that his brother was once again allied to the feelings of infection. He began to speak with oll his won warmth, and to conjure him on his marriage with such a distinguished sor rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprise to heitirig the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He grabbed the portrait in a parox...\nYsm of rage, and trampled under the feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future bvsband, he loo ked as if he djd did not underestimate it, then shaking his hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of Countrice, he told him to swear that sho wouil would never have married this walruser, for he—but he could not move forward—he seemed clis if this way told him again his aath—he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Rutbven was a swallow but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return of her disorder, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his pens to them, he begged, he enjoined them to delay, but one day. They, attributing this to the imagined madness, had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called Tbe morning aster the living room, and had boeri refused with evory another. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he easily understood that he was his couso; bvt when Ho learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hard to hide from those among whom he had won this computerist. He hastened to make the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great offense for the brother and the interested in his destiny, he gradually gained the ear of Mifs Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongve had darigers and oils to tell—could speak himself as an individuala1 having no sympathy with any being on the crowded plateau, except with whom he addressed himself;—could say how, as he knew, his existenceencc, had begun to seem worthy of preservatiori, except that he could be listed with his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of Saat, that he won his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained the important embassy of Ari, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his 6rother,) which was to place the lake the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physiclan and his guardians, tried to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she enjoyed her own hattine-\nss, his own honor, and the hanour of those who are now in the gravo, who held him in arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to delay but for a few hours that mclrigage, on which hc denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised Ibey to abandon him; but by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrcy's miride by, what he hates, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; the avil Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily imagined than ribed, notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, gradually fading away, leaving bim in the custody of an old powerless woinan. He seized the opporlunlty, wjtb a bound was ovt of the room, and in a momenl was in the aparlmcnt where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the chamber tho, speechless with fury. Wheri on the stcllrcaso, Lord Rulhven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee in the day, that Sister Yaur is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his aliens, who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage found no ventilation, had braked a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present wbcn he entered, as the physjcian was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, the wife left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; blood effusi0n produces symptoms of the dowry approach. He had his sister's guards called, and if the hour of midnight had struck, he would constantly resume what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hastened to protect Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, Aurid Aubrey's sister was thirsty for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world of Tbe was quite he, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his greed.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, on one of Her Majesty's ships, iri in the year 1812, we put in the port af Mitylene, in the east1 and by that name. The bcauly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have there, junges many British ships to visit it — both men of war and merchants; and although rather outside the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. Wo disembarked; like ufuaI, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men used us the watering of iri, and the trading exchange for the wild cattle the natlves, the ecclesiastical and the mysels caught a mble at the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beef0re. Dn the bone front Mount Ida (a mountain smoll so named) we took with and hired a young guide Greekas 0ur, who said uf he had had Scio eome with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival jn his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said lheGreek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose qvit Mililene, wbero I am probably Get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid he has Iefft an old man in charge of this one: he gaues Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English Curriculum,) ond lived there fourteen months, he is not ebbing; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity a lot, and we lost n0 time in haste to the huso where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by the old man, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were decorated with al1 sirnply: light green walls, mclrble tables on the ejther side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small brieath fontairi, which could be made for p1ay through the bracbes by moving a spring fixod on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posture; a largc or a sofa coplicted the furnillure. In the room there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor slngle pclining. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the sloor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the chamone bed in Greece. In the living room, we had a recreation rnarblo, once, the old man told us, flipod with books and papers, which were then in the oestin of a seafaring Iarge in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the containers. The works of Volteiro, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmcrman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller on the brigands; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several brochures from Constantinople's Greek press, very torn, but no description arie English. Most of these books were wired1 with marginal riots, wrjtten with a pencil, in Italian and Lcltin. The Messiab was literally scratched everywhere, arid marked wjth paper briefs, on which were also noted.\nThe old man said: \"Iord had read these books in the evening sitting that he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, says ho, they must lie there his roturry; for it is so special, that if I saw ane lhirig without order, he would frown me for a week together; he is otberways very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the distress of takjng caro af il, with the exception of twenty zesh ines which I pay to an Armenian agcd who resides in a cottage srall in the wood, and which the lord has crushed here, Adrianople; I don't know why.\"\nThe outer appearance of the thcbouse was pleasant. The portic0 in front was fifty pacef long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars with black plinths and working comioes of the frets (as it is now the usual architecture iri Greek,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under the property of coarse linen ftrong. M0st of the house-tops are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, driving ligbt Winos, such as \"lacbryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the bloody tbe breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we were erising the house of Tbe, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental weaden back, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his enigs and nights up to twelve o'clack, walking, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the man of Eid, praying, \"for he was very dovout, and always went to our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of the seat was what can be called 6c \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye lo Mo urit Calcla, covered with arid olive trees myrtle in bioom, and on the top of which an anciant Greek temple oppecled iri majestic cay. A sma ll stream came from the ruins descended in broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sca smootbas glafs, arid a harizon not eclipsed by a single cloud, terranates tbe seen in frorit; and a little on the fear, through a view of high hazelnuts and palm trees, small islonds seueral were diftinctly obscrved, spreading the spots of the light blue wave wilh of emerald green. I liked a uiew moro that I did; but our investigation\nThe name of the person who had lived in this romantic solitude was without result: no one knew his name, but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Armenian,\" weld our driver, \"could say, I'm sure he won't, he says, and canniote, my old friend, if I can, he says, I don't dare. We did not have the time of Uisit l'Armenion, but upon our return to the city we learned several parts of the secluded lord. He had shared the view of the young girls when he was last on the island, and even panicked with them at the wedding feast. He scratched a cow to a man, hordes to others, and colton and silk to the girls who first made these articles. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the paor ohildren. In short, it appeared to us, srom everything we have collocated, for having beeri cl very ecoenteric character benevolent. A circumstance that we have leamt, which our old friend at the cottoge bought clean not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom he was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought him a piario-forte, and had taught him how to use it himself.\nThis was the information with the whlch that we left from the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philanthropy 0f disposition, and oll these eccentricities whleh renark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling jn company witb Mr. FOSTER, thc architect, o pupil of WYATT'S, what had been troovervelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said to be, \"butt that you are worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him cll Mililene.\" We have never heard of his seigneury's fclme, as we had 6ecn a few years of hoine; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Ca1cla in each page. Have we not been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we have consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning t0 Mitylene ori a future day; but for me that day will not rcturn. I made a statement, I'm not entirely unworthy of it, and in court, I said the good riam of the seigneury, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to asocialism with the humari nature, or contributing in any way to appease his grief, or to add to his pleasures. Tbe fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anecdolef. All the finest feelings of the coffin, so elegantly veiled in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at rest is an additional reason to mark him as a bei ng ori whose hat of the Hoarl religion sealed, and on whose head the Volunteer has thrown his intestine. Man N0 can read the pleasant \"traits\" before feeling proud of him as a countrymon. With regard to his l0vc or his pleasures, I do not assume the right of giuo an apinion. Reports are always received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral irity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before this horrific trial where everything must appear, only can convive the mistakes of a confrere-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of thcworld, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and confidence of salt approval.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printcr, Crown Court, Floet Street.",
    "11": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is stuffed is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend iteIf to the Uritil Greeks after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed its present farm only since the division of Latin and Greek herches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still outcast, of dead lho rising from tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight voriat ion, throughout the Hungclry, Poland, Austria and Lorroin, where the belief existed, that the vampyres nightIy soaked up some of the blood of thoir's victims, who had emaculated, lost their strength, and died suddenly of consumption; while the fe bumans sucking fatted blood — and thcir veins dissipated to such a state af repletion, in order to cause the blood flow ta of all the passagos of the laher bodies, and cven of the same beards of their skin.\nIn the London Jovrnal of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, the account weedible bone a porticular case of vampyrism, which is said to be bave took place in Madreyga, Hungary. He aspires, basing himself on the exomination of the commander-in-chief and the magisterates of the place, they warn positively and without complacency, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, namcd Arnold Paul, had beeri heclrd to say, that, in Cassouia, on the froriticers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vompyec, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating from the suin of the earth ovt from the tomb of the vampyr, by rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a hirnself vampyr; sar, about twenty-thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of being lured by him, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of 1ifc by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants consulted their Hadogni, took the body of TB, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in vampyrism cases) fresh, and entirely free of corruptiori, and emitting to thc moulh, nose, and ears, pure and florid 6lood. After being obtlinated, they resorted to the usual rem edy. A stake was completely led through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, where it is reported t0 also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his dog, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the horns of these porsons who had previovsly died of vampyrism, Iest they should, in turn, become agentf upori of others who survived lhem.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it adapts to the illustration of the subject matter of almost any instance that could be produced. In many parts of Groece it is considered as a kind of pvnjshment after dealh, for a heinous crime committed in exile, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his visitsatlons insertncll only to those beings he loved most when on earth — those to whom he was bound by afkinred bonds and affection.—A supposition alludes to iri the \"Giaour\".\nBul first on the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be of the tomb to rent; then hauntingly haunting the place of origin, and sucking the bood of all thy race; Thrust snore thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the parse of life; Yel tarnish the banquet that persecutes must feed thy livid living corsus, Tby victiins, be they exhale, They shall know the devil for their sere; As you cursed, you cursed hem, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. Butane for your crime Mvst Fail, the youngest, beloved of all, will bless You with the name of a fothor: This word will envelop your heart in flames! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the last icy look must see Whieh freezes his lifeless blue; Theri wjth hond without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, De whilch, in life a lock when the thorn The tenderest Plede of Trouble has been worn—But now is carried by you Momorial of your agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy tooth of gnashlng, and the lip of gagard; and after thy tomb of sulten, Go-clend with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll those with harair shririk far more cursed spectrum than thcy.\nMr. Southey also lows i ntroduced in bis wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arablan Oneiza, wh0 is represented as bringing back from the grave with the aim of tormenting bim sho better loved whiest in existence. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of her life, it has been spilled throughout history as a coplet type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long aoount in its travolf of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have witnessed ari; ond Calmet, in his work green vpon this subject, besides a variety 0f aneodotos, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a ciastic, af we1l as barbaric error.\nMany curiovs and interesting opinions on this singularly horrible ght superstition be added; although the present rnay suffices for the limits of a noto, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, lhat if the term Vampyre is that in most genres acceptclion, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in the varlous parts of lhe wor1d: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt has occurred that in the nridst of the dissipations accompanying a London winter,\nthe different parties of the chiefs of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its sirigularities, rank of thcln hjs. Ho looked at the mirlh around him, as if he could participate in the scene. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted his attention, thal he could by o look at the calm, and throw foals into the breasts in tbose where thought reigned. Thoso, who felt this filiation of fear, could not explain from where she clones: sorde attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a peorce glance through the iriward functioning of the heart; bul fell on the cheek to the mind a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His weaknesses invited him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to sow him, and those who had been accustomed to violent extermination, and now fell the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of enganging their tension. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, cithcr of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her shape and the outside were tiring, mclny of the women hunters after did not try to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some marks of whal that they might call affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marlage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountain6ank, to attract her attention: — though in voicing: — when she stood before him, although her eye was apparently fixed to her, it seemed however unperceived; — even unacclaimed impudence was baffled, and sho came out of the field. But if the adultery commune could not influence even the guidanoea of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. It is bad, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and that it is that even he has overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they have been moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was also often among the Tbose women who make up the boast of their fex of their domestico virtues, as among the lhose who push her through their vices.\nA6 at the same time, he arrived at Lo ndon cl young gentleman by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with only one sister in possession of great Beltb, by the parents who died who ho was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guardians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the custody of the subalternants, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which completely destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed all tosympathy with virtue, and bought that vice was cast by Provldenoe only for the effecl pjcturesque of tbe soene, as we see in romances: he thought that tbe misery of a cottagc simply consisted of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which ch were better suited t0 the peer eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of poets were the reolities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for this reason, when he entered the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least noise their languishing or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him in notical salsé of his ta1ents and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the arid candlc wax torch that freaked out, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life if there were none of these pleasant congreseries af photos and descriptions intersected in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, finding a little complacency in his gratified vanity, it was abhorrent to give up his dream, when the extreme being that we described abovc, went through it in his career.\nHe took possession of himself, and the impossibility of forming himself on the idea of the character af a man was absorbing himself, who assured few other signs of his 0bservation of extortive objects, that tacit consent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: a1lowing his imagination to imagine the ury thirig lhat flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, hc quickly formed this object in the hero of a romance, and determined at 0 bserve the 0fspring of his faney, rather than the person in front of him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and until now clduanced von his opinion, and his presence was always recognized. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthueri's working quarters were confused, and he soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this singular charaeter, which, until now, had directly struck his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been thought necefsary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the vicc caroeur to put themselves on equality with age, and not to allow larn to appear as so frustrated the sky, whicriever intrigues scandalous are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or prajse, agreeing to the degree of competence shewri in the transport lbem ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on the part of the hive, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity of stvdying the character of Lord Ruthuen, and now he has found, e, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the resvlts have offered different ooriclusions srom the apparent motives for his conduct. His companjon was profusc in his liberality; — the idle, the vagrant, and the bcggar, received from his hclnd more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not point out, that he was not on him virtuous, reduced to indignation by the calamities that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he begotten his alms; — these were sent out of the wilh gate barely apprehensively sneezing; but when the prafligatc came to ask for something, not to cast down his desires, but to bring him down from his lick, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the grealer importunity of the vicious, who generalized on the retirement of the indigent virtue. There were atrocious circumstances about the barbarity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found tbat there was a curse on jt, for they were all led to scaffolding, 0r sunk down and the most abject misery. In Br ussels, in other cities, they passed by, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent enormity with which his companion sought the centers of all the fashjonab1e vice; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and played always with wilh svccess, except where the kriown was his anlagonist, then he lost more than he had goir; but it was always with the face without change of sclme, with which he generally looked at society around: he was not, however, if he would encumber the young rah novito, or the unmarked father of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with the morc fire of the cat while he was delirious with the mouse of balf-dead. In every city, he left the devious asfluent, torn from the cjrcle, he looked, cursed, in the solitude of a dvngeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fjend; while many a father sat fraritic, in the midst of talking about children hungry for mule, without a single sarthing of his immenfe riches, where with buying enough tropi to make their present cravirig happen. Yct he took rio silver fr0m the embossing table; but immedally losl, to theruinor of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the irinocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which is not, howev er, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to resign himself to his friend, and to ask him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and which did not tend to his own profit; — but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him a sine qua non opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his oarriagc, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he was not given a gratification groater srom it than the constant exotation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which exalted the magination began to fuss the appearance of something supernoural.\nThcy soon arrived in Rome, arid Aubrey sore a time lost of sight of his companion; he was afraid that he would enter the daily room on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he was marrying in search of the memorials of another deserted city. When he was engaged, letters came from England, whatb he opened upwithwitb impatient; the first came from his sister, breathing anything but the afsection; the other wreaths of his guardians, the latter forced him; if he had before irito buried his imaginatlon that there was a pulpit in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seize his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly flawed, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had discovered, that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to rob his gralificatiori, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from unwelded tho pirinacle of uirtve, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females that hc had suggbt, apparently in accour of their virtue, had, from the beginning, even thrown the mask, and had not grated to expose all the deformity of the vices tbelr for tbe public gaze.\nAubrey determined on Ieaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on wbich to rest the tbe eye. He resolved to invcnt home plausible pretext to abandon him altogelher, seeking, in the wbile rnean, to look at him moro closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is sedom that an unmarried woman is mixed up in sodomity; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye trampled him in all his windings, quickly climaxed that the transfer of clri had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, although he was without a daughter. L0sing no time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, arid abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, the inf0rming at the same time thal he was aware 0f his being aut to meet her that very nlght. Lord Ruthven replied, that his jntonions deserved as he would all have had on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry, let him be destined to marry him, only laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately written note, lo say, trot fr0m that momrit he must decree his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to cut off other apclrtments, and calling to the motber of the lady, informed him of what he knew, not only with regard to the hcr daughter, but also with regard to the characler of his lordsbjp. The subpoena was prevented. The next day, Lard Ruthuen simply sent his servant so that he had not given his complete consent to an exclamation; but he raised no suspicion as to his plans having been thwarted by Aubrey's irriterposltion.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to take hold of the faded recartes of ancient monuments and upori lhat apparently, shameful to broach the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Undcr the same reds as himself, exislcd a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she mimbt formed the model for a painter whipping for pavrtray on canvases the promised hope of failure in the paradjse of Mclhomet, saue hot hcr eyes spoken too mvch spirit f0r Anyone t0 thinks it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain of Tbe, one would have thought of the gazelle a poor typc 0f hor castics; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently tbe eye of animated riature, for this luxurious pâté sleeping 0f the suitable animal but t0 the taste of cln epicure. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Au6rey in his search for antiquities, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his forin, floating as it was on the wind, at thc avid gaze of him, who slanged the letters that he had just deciphred on a tablet of the extreme brazen, in the c0ntemplati0ri of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids fall, while she wilts araund, exhibiting in the ray of the sun svch delicately bright and swif tly fad ing hves, he may well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the voric object that he had before being of vital importance for the proper inlerprelalion of a passagein Pausclnias. Bul why try to describe the tears that everyone feels, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by hy rowed drawing rooms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing these remains of mourning, he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and galvanized the magical effects of her peneil, tracing the scenes of her bloated natius; she would then describe to him the circular dance on the open pla in, would fold to him, in all the flamboyant colors of the memory of the youth, the marriage pump that she remembered outside of the infarction; and then, turning to the subjects lhat had obviously made a greater impression in her mind, would tell her al1 the tales of surnatura1 of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she shared with him the story of the vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful fairy1e to prolong his existence from the months that followed, his bl0od was running cold, while he landed your laughter at these horrible fantasies id1e; but Ianthe quoted to him the riams of the old men, who had found themselves for the last time among themselves alive, after sovenal of their close relatives arid chjldren had been found marked by the seal of the fiend'f appetito; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged to believe it, for he had been noticed, that those who had dared to distract themselves from their exjsence, had always had a proof of glvc, which forced them to confess to himself and to break his heart. She gave her the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise descriptioni0n 0f Lord Ruthven;hc, however, still persisted in persuading her, there could not be truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coiricidences that had all tried to exci to a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulhuen.\nAubrey began to cling more and more and to inorer lo Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected by the women he had sought for the vision of love, gained his heart; arid as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without due, he found him ever more attached to the charity of the fairy enchanting him. He tore it to Tyrines fr0m hor, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he went away, decided not to return in vain his object was attacked; but he still found it impossible to fix his waiter on the ruins to adorn him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possession0r of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same welcome of frank children as he had known the first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was well known that she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite crowns, while her guard waf occupied ln sketch or discover a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and tbey b0th, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with very name tbe harpor. After Saon, Aubrey decided to make one of the bif excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, they all at the same time begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pclss through a wood, which no Greek ever remajn, after tbo day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as a seaside resort of the vampyres in their night orgjes, and gave the heaviest evj1 as imminent on the one who steals to cross the path of thcjr. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them welder to his audacity so as to mock himself o superior, infernal power, the very name of what apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nThe next morning Aubrey left at the end of his trip without lingering; he was surprised by the observation of his host's face, and was concerned that the words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired the trick of such terror. When he was to leave, Ianthe Caine t0 the faithfulness of his horse, and sincerely prayed to him to turn back, the night allowed the power of these beings to be pvt in actiori;—he promisod. However, he was so busy in his research, that he made riots perceive that dcly-lighl was going to get angry, and that in h0rizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in an atrocious inass, and pluck all rage on the devoted country.—He finally, Howeuer, mounced his horse, destcrrninated to catch up by the speed for the delay of hjs: but it was too late. The twilight, in these moods of soul, is almost unknown; immediately the sun warms up, the night begins; and if it had been advariated far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failing had barely a jnlerval of rest — its thick hcavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the cover, whipping the forked blue lightning seemed fal1 to irradiate its own feet. Suddenly his horse took frigbt, and he was carried with terrible speed through the stumped forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was iri the vicinity of a bollel lhat barely rose up the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he said\nIt's about finding someone to guide him in the city, or at least relying on him to get him from the storm basin. As he approached, the tbunde rs, for a silent moment, allowed him to pull out the terrible screams of a woman who was mixing with the suffocator, exulting m0ckery of cl laughter, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound;—he was surprised: bul, agitated by the thunder that agairi rolled on his pearl, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself found absolute darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was not perceived at the time, for although he was called, the auridae were still intoxicated, and he was not informed. He found himself in contact with someone whom he seized immediately; when a voic cried out, \"Again mocked!\" to whom a great laugh began to stir; and he laid down himself, struck with a force that seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and cast huge forces against the ground; his enemy threw himself on the hiin, and leaned on hjs breclst, had laid his hands on his throat; when the girth of mclny torches leaning through the hole of thc lhat lit him in the day, he shook him; he immediately rose up, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at one moment the crash of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heed. The storm was still; and Aubrey, Incapable of murmuring, was soon heard by those who did not. Tbey entered; the highl of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thalcb loaded each straw with heavy footflakes. To the desire of Aubrey, they sought her, who had drawn the bim with her cries; they left him again in the darkness; but what he abhors, which the ljg of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the cliry form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corse of ljfelefs. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an arisjng visiori of his dislocated imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strangled at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a mortilège abovt his sace which seemed as almose attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throal were the marks 0f teeth hovering open the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, simultclneousIy struck wilhbornor, \"In Vampyre! a Vampyrc!\" A litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the subject of so many brilliant and magical vibes, now fallen with the flower of Iifo who had died with her. He did not know what the gypsies were, if the spirit was inflamed and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his harid a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. Thcy was soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, which learned of the eity, prepared the parents for a terrible catastrophe. \"It is impossible to describe the sorrow of the child; but when they ascended because of their child's debauchery, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were incons0lablo; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed wcls seized with a violent inost fever, and was osten delirious; in such intervals he called Lord Rulhven and on Ianthe—by an inexplicable combina, he seemed to be begging of his former c0rnpanion to spare the being that he lovcd. He permeated the curses on his head at the time, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance at the time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, on hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constituent ant landing. When he recovered from his delirium, he began to see the one whose image he had now combined with the image of a Vclmpyre; bvl Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implies jng a1most repentance sher the fault that had caused their separation, and fti1l renounced by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury felt completely changed; he seemed to be only the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; bul as soon as his 6egan convalescence to be quick, he gradually connected in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference srom the old man, except tbath to tjmeshe was taken to meet his gaze fixed on bim, with a smile of malicious exuItatjon playing vpon his lips: he knew no reason, but tbjs smi1e haunted him. During the last stage of the restoration of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in the waltz of the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in the marking of progress of these orbs, circumstantial, like our world, the motionless sun;—in fact, it seemed losb to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's inarid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elastia, as the spirit that had once distinguished him today, had the right to flee forever. Ho was now as fond of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he frequented badly in form, the shape of Iarithe was 6y bis side – if he sought him in the woods, bcr light not would be errandirig in the middle of the wood, in the shadow of the modest violet; then suddenly blushing, would show, to his wilid imagination, his pale and wounded face, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all the characteristics of whjcb created such bitter associations in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he was bathed by the tender care which he had taken from hjm during his illness, that they did not visit these parts of Greece or have yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but they bathed in t0 room, but they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to lighten the tbe relations, which they imagined to be the inventjon of individuals, who were interested in exciting tbe gcnerosily from those whom they defended from so-called darigers. In the consecration of lhus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, one day they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. At the entrance, at the end of a whirlwind, a narrow defilement, with large masses of rocks descended from the vicinity of the precipices, they had reafon to repent of their rigor; for there was little of all the party engaged in narrow pclss, when thcy was surprised by the whistling of bvllets near their heads, and by the ratio of echo af several cannons. In an instant, their gvards had left them, and, plclcirig themselves behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction of Tbe from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltering 0f the defilement: but shameful to be so hated by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, made them advance, and beirig exp0sed to the slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they decided to 0ne to rush in search of the cncmy. Had Hordly lost shelter from the rock, wben Lord Rulhuen received a shot in the shoulder, which had Broughl hlm on the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the help or his own peril, he was surprised to see the hearts of the thieves around him — his guards having immediately cast their arms and furs on Lord Ruthven's wounded.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a neigbbouring hut; and having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their prcsencc — they simply kept the disobedience read out their comrade should retum with the promised surne, so that he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength decreased rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and deglaze seemed to soften with precipitated stcps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaware of the pain that he had been boned, the objects lowered him; but towards the end of the last evacning, bis mirid apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye flxed up Aubrey, wbo was induced to for his assistance with more usual seriousness—\"Help me! You can save me, for you have not done more than beat, I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; 6 but you can save my honor, thehanour of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little — my life is accelerating — I can't explain everything — but if yov wovld concecll all yu know of me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England—but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying husband, rising up violently exulted: \"Swear with all your soul, with all fear of nature, swear that one year and one day you will make known my crimes or death to the living being on the way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"Hjs's eyes seemed to burst out of their fockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was laughing on his paillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey rested, but did not sleep; the many clrcumslances altering his anguish with this man rose up on his mind, and we do not know why; when he remembered his oalh a cold chill came upon him, as if from the preepitation of the same horrible thing lament him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in wbich, he had left the orpse, when a sedan met hirn, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retirement, to the pirinac1e af a neighbouring movnt, according to the promise they had given to his lordshlp, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of tb moon tbat rose after his deatb. Aubrey astonished, and taking several men, determined to go and bury on the place where he 1ay. But, when he climbed wrong to the top, he found no trace of eitber the body or clothes, although the robbers fwore they emphasized the identical rock on which they laid the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in conjecture, but finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse f0r the false clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for heigbten lhat superstitious melaricholy who had seized his mlnd, he rcsolidated to leave him, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While he was waging lamentations for a ship to die in Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of tbose that he had with the bjm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Other cases included the case of several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to evacuate the victim's death. There, the scveral daggers cling. While turning them around, and looking at the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an apparently omented sheath in the same style as the dagger discovered in fatcll's hut — he trembled — rushing to get other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he untied it was equivalent, though peculiorially shaped, to the sheath he held in his group. His eycians seemed to have no need for further certainty — they seemed to look to be blind to the aggregate d; but still he wifhed to debellish; but the particular shape, the healthy variegation on the hoft and the sheath were similar in splendor on both, and left rio from the place to doubt; there was also drop of blood on each.\nHo loft Srnyrna, and on his way back to Rorne, his first inquiries were about the lady he had tried to striatch Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fort was ruined, and she had not been heard of the detachment of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had ransacked a victim at Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his ordinary grip consists in exhorting the speod of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calclis; a bree2e, who seemed obedient to his will, soon taunted him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his falcons, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the embracs and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had won her afsection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was still tied up like a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartrnenl. His blue eye was incver lit vp by the levelty bones the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about this wbich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which appeared to indicate a consoious soul of a brighter reum. His step wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a co1our could attract – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, her bag was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her pre-enccretion those sorrows which she knew deslroyed hjs rcst, who could have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe has not yet been introduced to the world, and his guards have thought that his presentation should be delayed until his brother's return from the continent, when he was his prolector. That is why it is now decided that the next show, which approved quickly, should be the time of writing in the \"gold sawmill\". Aubrey wovlid rather havc stayed in his fathers' house, arid fed on the melancholy that dominated him. He couldn't feel intercst abo ut the frivolities of the strangers foshionablc, when his bcld spirit was so torn by the events he had seen; but he dissuaded from sacrificing his own comfort to the protection of his sislor. They soon arrived in tawn, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nTho's crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile took it. Aubrey was there with her sister. Wbile hc stood in a corner by himself, without worrying about everything around him, hired Jn the Romambrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that place, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, arid a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear — \"Remember Yaur's oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would make him lose, when he was perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his notjce on this place when he first entered society. He looked at his lirns almost by refusing to carry their weight, he was obsessed with taking a friend's arm, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He trampled the room with twisted steps, and fixed his hand on his head, as if he feared his thoughts would explode in his brain. Lord Ruthven once again beware of him—circonstancef startod iri terrible array—the dagger—bis aath.—He awakened him1f, he could not bolieve this possible—death rises again!—He thought his imagination had conjvred upwards in his mind rested on. It was impossible for him to be rea-\nSo he decided to return to society; for if he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name clinged to his lips, and he was able to obtain information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Levjng she under the prowess 0f a matron, he withdrew into a recreation, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. He awoke, and entered another city, and found his sister surrounded by several persons, apparently in a serious ephemeral; and he tried to pass by and draw near to her, when one of them, whom he prayed to move, turned around and revealed to him those traits which he despised most. He went forward, seized his sister's arin, and, with a hasty step, forced her to the street: The door which he found obstructed by the crowd of servants who served their lords; tied while he was engaged iri passing them, he heard again this voice which whistled olose to him—\"Member your oath!\"\"He did not do daro to turn around, but, in a hurry of kisses, soon came to the house.\nAubrey beeclme alinost diffract. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more c0inpletely was he absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thought. The alteritions of her fisher were now unheard of, and it was in the vajn that she forced her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more dizzy he was. His aath held him; — was he a tberi that this monster should wander, bringing ruin upon the hls broath, in the midst of all that he held; and did he not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he had to break his ears, arid discloses his suspicion, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own band to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister clapped, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from street to street, anxiovs to steal this image that he haunted. His dress was ravaged, and he wandered, often exposed to the midday sun as to medium humidity. He was no longer recognized; he first came back with the evocation at home; but finally, he laid him down to rest that the aileron's fatigue had exceeded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him wbo fled from a pursuer more than any — far from the purchase. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left all his friends, with a fiend among them, with the presence of which they lament, ho determined to enter society again, and watching Closcly, anxious to predict, despite his oats, all that Lord Ruthven approached with imitation. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and harassed eyes were so striking, chills of bis towards the inside so visible, that his sisler was finally forced to beg of him for abslairi to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, the demonstration proved to be inavailjng, the guardians thought appropriate of interpas, arid, foarjng thot bis mind was to become alienated, they thought it was high time to resume ago in that trvst wblch had been imposed on him before them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous to save him from the arid susferings injvries that he met daily in his wclnderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired the doctor cl to reside in the house, and take care of him consant. He hardly appeared in the riot, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There, he often lied for days, unsightly of awake bellg. He had emaciated the bee, the eyes of hjs had reached a glassy lust; — the only sign of clffection and memory remaining appeared on his sister's cnlry tbe; then he would begin somotimes, and, sawing his hands, with the thal appearances seriously distressed, he might have wished her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answcr was: \"Truly! True!\" Again, he fell into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. Thjs lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and if the spirit was extinguished from a part of his glooïne, wept his guards, observed that several times in the day he counted on his frigers a defined numberhor, then Fmile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, rising, on the last day of the year, one of his tutors erecting his room, began to covet with his doctor on the circumspect melancholy of Aubrey's being in such a clumsy situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, whose fear they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the noun of the Count of Marsden. Tbinking it was a young Earl wbom whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them stjll swears by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing seo his sjster. They didn't answer, bul in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capoble to be affected by the irfluence of the beautiful smile; for he pressed it into his chest, and kifed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to his brother's hem to be once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate his vpon hor marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and excessive accomplishment; when he saw wisely a medallion on his chest; open it, what was it surprise to look at the proueuros of the monster who had so long jnfluenced his life. He captures the portrait of Tbe in an aparoxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. She then asked him to give her the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not stop her — by seizing from her hordes hands, arid looking at her a frantic expression of her face, he made her swear that he would never marry this monster, far from there—but he could not accommodate himself—he realized as if that voice made her reborn his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthvonos saw no one near him. Meanwhile, the guards and the pbysicians, Wbo had the whole beard, and thought that he was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forcing him to attack Miss Aubrey, wanted his leavc hirn. He fell for his bows to them, he made a plea, he begged them for your lateness, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined having taken the p0session of his mind, loved to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven hcld cracked in the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with all the others. Whcn hc heard of Aubrey's disease, which he himself understood to be the cause; bul when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultatiari and pleasure could hardly be corrected from those among the wham he had won this information. He fell down in the house of his former companion, and, by his coerce, and the claim of much affection for the arid brother inlerost in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could terminate his power? His tongue had dangers and toils, which could speak of itself as an individualol having no sympathy to the mind any being on the crowded ear, sow with her to whom he addressed;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had mened to appear to be a watchful of preservation, if she wore only that he could lift to soften the accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's orle, or that was the fate, that he gained from horfoctions. As the bed of the elder branch fell long to him, he kept a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's dorriged state,) which was to take place the same day before the departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the pbysician and hift guards, tried to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter lo his fisher, corrigating it, as she valued her own hoppie, her own h0nour, and the honor of those who naw in the grave, who once kept ber in lhelr arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest m0 curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving him to his doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Avbrey's spirit any more by, what he considered, the trick of a maniac. Night passod on restless ta the occupied inmates of the h0uso; and Aubrey heord, with a horrible thal can be more easily concelved than described, notes 0f occupied preparation. In the morning, Carne, on the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up most frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally vanquished their vigilanoe, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman. He seized the opportunity, with a b0und was out of the room, and jn a moment was found in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Rutbven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, shook him from the room, without fear of fury. When a staircase, Lard Rulbven bowed in his ear: \"Remember the oath of Yaur, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, that your sister Js was dishonoring. Women are frajl!\" So he pushed him in search of his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage not finding Vont, had broken a blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, like the pbysic wcls afraid to hug him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and wife were spoiled for fear that Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; bloodshed produced symptoms or near-death approach. He disdained his sister's guordians, which were called, and when midnight had struck, he was in connection with what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Mjss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had the glullcd tho tbirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXT RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNTABILITY OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE AGENDA, &c.\n\"The world fought in front of Bim, he chose his place of rest, and the guide Providecnce bis.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's vescls, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of the Eclte. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo ond vegctablcs aIwclys of having lérc, lead many British vessels to visit it — both the men of war and mercharitrnen; and thovgh it is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Srnyrna, its burgers pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landcd; as usual, at the bay bollom, and while the men were employed to water, and the sacrillary trading for cattle with the natives, the clergy and mysels took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, wbere we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so namod) We met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who said vs. he came from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene Qujt, where I am likely to marry. He was a strange man, 6 on a very good man. The cotta above the hil, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old inan in charge: he gclve Dominick, lbe wine-trador, six hundred zechins for him, (a6out L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen monlhs, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often for tobe different islands.\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time harassing the house where our man had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to our mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decoratcd: p1ain green-staried walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrlle in the center, and a small fountain brieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed source in the side of a SmalI Bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood balf cl dozen English cane chclirs, and an empty boak-case: there are no mirrors, nor a single pain. The bedroom had only a large mattross spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common raven throughout the Greece. In the living room, we observed a rec ess of marble, once the old man said vs., filled with hooks and papers, which were then in the chest of a lorgeseaman in the closet: it was open, but we did not think justified ovrselves in the oxaminlng the contons. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roussoav are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiclh of Klopstock; the novels of Kot2cbue; the play of Schiller of the R0bbers; the Paradise Losl of Mi1ton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled wilh mclrginal riots, written in the spirit o pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was lilerally seribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, ori which were also remarks.\nThe old man of Tbe said: \"The lord bad bcen reading these books in the evening that he sailed, he forgot to place Lhom with the others; but, he said, they must lie there until they return; for he is so parlicular, that if I had to move something with orders, he would frown me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. One day I made him a servcc; and I have the products of this farm because of taklrig boredom care of him, attracted twenty zechins whom I pay to an elderly Arinenian who resides iri a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord crushed here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of outdoor use was pleasant. The portico at the front was long and fourteen wide, on the canned marble pillars with black plinths and fret work cornices, (as is the custom of riow in Greciari clrchitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was wrapped by a beautiful procession of Turkey, under an awning of fort Iinen coarse. Most of the house roofs are furnished, as the Greeks spend their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"Iachryma christi\", including freuil, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we went into the hause, a small stream moved away, grapes, oranges and lindens clinged together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of blueberries, a grated soot was placed with a back of Ornamenlal wood, on which we are told that the Lord spent many of his evenings late at twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking himself. \"I suppose,\" said the man of honour, \"that he was shining because he was very fervent, and that he always otted our church twice a week, bcside Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A rich 0f vineyard line led lbe eye to Mount Ca1cla, covered with 0 living and myrtle trees in 6loom, arid on the top of the one whose ancient Greek tompI appear od in majesty desceoy. A small stream emitting fram the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was losl in the woods near the base of the rnuntain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of high oak trees and palm trees, several small islands distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a view more than I did; but our riquiries were fruitless your name os thc no one who had resided in the Romanic solitude: no one knew his riame but Dominick, the hif banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" and can't you say it, old friend? \"If I can, greet him, I will not dare. We don't have to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we have left several parliculars of the secluded lord. He had been among the young girls when he was last on the island, and he danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving items. He also bought a new boot for a fisherman who had lost his fin in a storm, and he often gave the Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it all appeared, from all that we collected, 6 for hoveeen a very ecceritrjc and bone. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen bouncing on the seafront, and he had bought him a piano-forle, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the informationjon with which we left the peaceful island Mitylene os; ov imaginations all on tbe rack, guessing who are the rambler iri Greeocould. He had money, it's obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all these eccentricities mark pecu liar goniu s. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who has badly traumatizing in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he does, \"what are you so clnxiouf, if Lord Byron; I greet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I saw him al Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had done a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla in each pagc. Decply was it regretted that we had been curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of rcturning at Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, I relieve it of all interest, and in justice of the good name of his lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, averse association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorr0ws, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as a way to be clearly collected from these IIttle anecdotes. All the finest feelings of tbe heclrt, so elegantly represented in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tendelle, the syinpathy and charity seem to spoil all his acljons: arid his courtization of the rest of solitude the additional ari r eason for markirig him as a being on whose heart the religion sealed, arid on the head of which Bencvolence threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a covntryman. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Reports are subject to prudence, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify his words before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of the other. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genlus. For good secret, and to escape the applause of the world, is the surest of the disadvantages of a virtuoso heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "12": "VAMPYRE;\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is exhausted is very general in the East. Amang the Arabs It seems to be emmon: it does not extend to the Greeks, however, until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has not flashed its presenl form since the division of the Latin and Greek church; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it has gravitally inorased, and has formed the object of many wonderful storio, still in progress, os il deod raising their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful tbe. In the West, it extends, with some slight variations, ol1 on Hungary, Poland, Austrla, and Larraie, where the belies existed, that the vampyres soaked at night a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and died quickly of consumptions; whllst these suckers of greasy human blood—arrange their dry veins to such a state of repulsion, to cause the blood of all passages of their blood, and even pores of tbeir skjnf.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oasis of vampyrifm, which was declared to have taken place in Madreyga, Jn Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the c0mmander-in-chief and the mclgistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard said, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. Thjs precauti0n, however, did not prevent him from becomjrig a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been moored by him, arid a statement was made, that the faures had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhabjtants who consulted tbeir Hadcligni, took the b0dy, and found it (cls is pleasep0sed as being usual cases of vampyrjsm) sresh, and completely free from corruption, and emjting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was questioned, TBey used the usual queen. A stake was led entirely through the heart and the body of Arnold Pavl, where it is reported to hash also shouted terribly as if it had been aljve. That's what they did, they ripped off his head, burned his body, and threw crampons into his throat. The same measures were adopted with corscs 0f people who had previously djed of vampyrism, for fear that they would become, in their turri, agents on the othcrs wh0 survive thein.\nThe universal belief is, that a pcrson sucks a vampyre bocome a vampyre hesels, and sucks in turn.\nChief, bclilisson.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, because it soems better suited t0 illustrate the subject of prosent oservations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greecc, it is consolidated a sort of punctuation after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned lo vampyrise, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties and affection. — An alIuded supposition to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus room shall be torn, and its tomb shall be torn; and then shall it haunt the notifying place, and suck the blood of thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet shall the bclnqvet that persecutes Musl feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are yet oxpirc, they are demolished for their sire; as thou cursed them, thy flaws smite upon the stem. But one of them for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best bewitched of all, Sholl blesses you with the name of a father—This word shail envelops the heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the tint of his oheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see Wbich freczos o'er it is ljfeless blue; then with the hand without Halloween shail tear The braids of his yellow hair, 0f which, in lifo a lock when shom The background pledge of Disorder was worn—But now is carried away by the memorial of your ogony! But with your own best blood, I will drip; your squeaking tool, your haggard lip; then I will hunt for the tomb of sullen, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nSouthey also became irritated in his wild but beautiful p0em of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampyre the Arab handmaid Oneiza, who is represented as having turned brake thc falls for lhc purp0se of tormenting hlm that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resisted the sinfulness of his life, being sbe poured out throughout history cl a complete type of purlty and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long encountering in his trips of several amazing cases 0f vampyrism, lo that he pretc-\nand Calmet, in his great band on the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forb a few left-handed djssertations, tcnding to prove that it is a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nA lot of interesting information about this singularly horrible superstition can be added; almost the present can stand for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to cxplanatiori, and which can be concluded by merely pointing out, that the term Vampyre is that in most acceptances generol, there are several athers synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations attackling over a London winter, a nobleman, remarkable for his singularities, appeared to be the rank of hjs, to the vorious parts of the leaders of the ton. He watched the mirror abort him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, Tbe Fair's light laughter only attracted attention, so that he could look at it, and throw fear into the breasts of th0se where the reckless reigned. Those who felt his feeling of apprehension could not explain that there was aroso: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, wbicb, clinging to the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and to a single glorice to pierce through the inner wheels of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His pecu1iaritief invited him to be invited to all the houses; all desired to see him, and tbose who was accustomed to the exceeding violence, and now felt tired of boredom, were happy to see something in their capoble presence to attract attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her university, which nevor gcline a warmer hue, eitber of the blush of modesty, or of the strong omotion of passion, although its arid form ovtline are beautiful, many female hunters after the avowed notoriety to gain her attentions, and to win, at leclst, some morks of what they put the lerm affection: Lady Morcer, who had been on the mockery of all monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw her sons into her way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, lo attracl bis remarked: — although in vain: — when she stood bef0ro him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, jt fcemed still as if they were vnceived; — even her unalised impudenco was strewn, and she left the field. But the common adultross could not influence even the orientation of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent warning with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innate daughter, that few know that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reproduction of a winning language; arid if it was that he had overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they had been moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among the women who formed the thrust of their sox of domestic virtues to bebeir, as among those who shook him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young Gontleman named Aubrey went to London: he was an orphan with only one sister in the pofsession of the wealth of g dream, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Bequeathed also to himself by guardians, who only have to take care of his forturia, while they retain the most important charge of his miride to take care of subalterns of mercenclry, he cultivates his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of banality and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He did everything he could to sympathize...\nHe thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of a vestige like elotbs, which were also hot, but which were adapted to the eye of the painter by their irrcgular fo1ds and their uariovs coloured spots. He bought, in the end, the poets' dreams were the reclicés af ljfe. He was beautiful, devious and rich: for lbese rocous, upon entering gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or grumpy favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by the sparkling eyes of Burmese, wben penetrated his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the love of his so1itary hours, he storted to find, tbat, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, nol srom lhe presence of a ghost, but in the absence of snuffing, lherc was not the true life of foundation iri for clny of these congreries os ple asing images and descriptions contained in these volurns, of whooh he had formed his study. Findirig, however, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being wc havc described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an ideo of the characleur of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observer of external objects, than the lacitive assent to their exile, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he soon formed this objecle as a hero of a romance, arid decided to obsess the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, drew attention to him, and thus to advance on his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, Lord Ruthven's business was embarrassed, and soon, from the notes of the preparatlan on the street, he began to surrender. Desiring to get some information about this character fingu1ar, who, up to naw, had only wbetted his urjosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow the yaungs to take a few quick steps in the vice career to put their choices on an equality with the elderly, and not to make them appear af jf fallen srom the heavens, whenever scandalous intrigues ore Menlioné like the sub-jeots of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to carry the cm. They heard: ond Aubrey immediately referring to his intentions lo Lord Rvthven, was taken to receive from him a proposal lo join him. Flattened by such a morque of osteem dehjm, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accelerated it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubroy had not had the opportunity to ridicule Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found, tbat, although many other of his actions have been expased in bis vue, the results have offered divergent conclusions fram the parent motive of his conduct. His companiori were prosused in the bis liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to revive their warit jmmediale. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was a riot on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the ottensive misfortunes even on virtue, which he granted to his alms; — these were sent out of the gate with barely repressed plots; but when tbe profligato came to ask for something, not to respond to his desires, but to allow him to tarnish his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he fled with rich castaways. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importvnity of the vicjous, which generally outweighs the retirement bashfulnefs of the virtuous Indian. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, whatb was more impressed on his mind: all the vpons that he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, because they were encumbered either led to the faffold, or sunk at the lowest and the rn0st abjecl misery. In Brussels and in other cities, where they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent impatience that his companion sought for the censors of all fashjonable vices; they were interested in the spirit of the Fara table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, arid then hc lost everi more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, wilh whoj that he grieved the society around: he did not, however, spoil, if, when he enlivened the eruption young nouico, or chancelcssss falher of a nvmerous family; theri his very wish shone the law of fortune — this oppressive abstraction of the spirit was removed, and his eyes shook more fire than that of the cat while dclllying with lhef-dead mouse. In every city, ho left the old easy youth, torn apart from the circle being trimmed, cursed, in the solitudc of a dungeon, the fate that hcld attracted him into the reach of his fiend; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the fugitive aspect of the mute hungry childron, without a single farthjng of late Himdenweth, wberwith to buy even enough to satisfy their current desire. But he did not take money from the game of chance; but immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last dorlot that he had just strier from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capoble os combat the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charitable pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit;—but he delayed it—for every day his friend gave him the opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and amplifying the wild and rich scenes 0f nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his uriosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the excitation c0nstarit of vairily wishing to lobble this mystery, which at his oxalted 6egan jmagination to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room on the morbid circle of the Italian Countess ari, while he went to the mercb of the memorials of the anothor alrnost descted city. Thus he was engaged, letters from EngIand, which he opened impatiently; the first came from the sister bis, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the last surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination that the thorus was a bad power residing in his comparison, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, irritated his licentious habits, which were dangerous to society. It had been dlscovcred, that his contempt for adultery had not generated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pjnnacle of vnsumed virtue, to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and n0t scrambled to cxtilize all the deformation 0f their vicef in the public eye.\nAubrey det-\ncriminated by leaving one, whose character had not shown a single luminous poinl on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposirig, by means, lo Walch more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstanoe. He entered the circle of the sarno, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady he was dealing with. In Itoly, it is rarely that a single woman is met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all the bis windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent and thoughtless girl. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her of the same thing as being clware to be about to meet her very night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were firm as he all thought on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry to know whether he intended to confuse him, he laughed mcrely. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately writing a note, to say, from that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the remorse of their proposed l0ur, he ordered hjs scrutinizing to look for other apartmerits, arid calling the m0ther of the lody, informed him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. Tho's assignment has been prevrated. The next day, Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; bul did not allud to any fuspicion beyond his years having thwarted the interposition of Hy Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greecc, arid crossing the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of iri tracing the faded traces of ancient glory upwards of monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the sealing ground or many lichen col0ure. Under the same roof as the hiinself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on the canvafs the promised hope of the Saysfvl in the paradise of Mahomct, except that her eyes spoke too inundated for it to have been made to belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the montsairi, it would have been thought that the gaze was a poor type to her beauties; for who was haughting exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animalcd nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the onimale adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his sea after antiquities, and often the girl uncorisclous, engaged iri the bone pursuit a Kashmere butterfly, show the beauty wbole 0f hcr form, floating as it was on the wind, your eyes greedy of bim, who forgot the letters that he came from deciphcrcd on a nearly erased tablet, in the os contemplation his figure of sylph. Often, his braids would fall, as the sbe wilted around, exhibiting iri the ray of the sun so delicately bright and swjftly feding drunks, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital import to the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why ottempt lo describe charrns that all the foel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, overflowing with roams of drawing and stifling bullets. As he drew remains in the tbose of whincb, he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, in the tracjng the scenes of her native placo; she would then describe to him the circlrig dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, lunning to subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, wou1d told him all the supernaturai tales of her nurse. Her carnesty and her apparent belief, if what she was telling, aroused the iriterest even Aubrcy bone; and often as she told her the story of the living vain-pair, who had spent years in the midst of her frjends, and the most dear ties, the year of the forced anger, by the eodjng on life af to Iovely female to take away her exlstance for the following months, her blood ran cold, while he began to laugh at such an idle and horrible fantasy; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had found the last living between them, after several of her relatives and children had found the lamp of the appetitc of their fiend to be marked; and when she found it so incredulous, she begged him to believe, for it had been, pointed out, that those who had dared to see their existence, always bad proof of somo, incredulous, she begged him, with grief and heart, to confess. She stripped him of the trophic operance of these monsters, and the horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise descriptor of Lord Ruthuen; however, he still persisted in persuading the ber, that there could not be truth in the horrible fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all made it possible to arouse a belief in Lord Ruthven's fupernatvral power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so confounded with all the affected virtuos af the Amang women he had sought for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a vneduced girl Greok, again he found himself increasingly attached to the almost magical form before hjm. He left him to timos, and, forming a plan for the s0meantiquarian search, he left, dissuaded from not returning to his object was attired; but he still found it impossible to keep his attention on the ruins that surrounded him, weeping in his mind, he kept a shot-tunage alone the right possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe has been a little crazy about her love, and has always been the same franc inflnti1e Like he knew the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; hut it was beeause she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favouritesjto havnts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some fragmcnt who had yet escaped the derisory time band. She had appealed to parents to ber a suhject of Vampyres, and the two, wilh several present, affirmed their existence, the pale horror of the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the p1aco, they all begged not to come back at night, for it had to pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, flyer the day had closed, vpon no consideration. They described the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most shocking evils as lmanquant upori hjm who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring tbus to mock a higher, insertial power, whose name even appeared to be Madc their blood gel, he was so1ent.\nThen Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his hosl, and was worried to make fun of the fact that words-bis, mocking a lhoose harrjble fiends, had inspired them by such terror. When he was about to dope, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. It was, howevcr, so busy in the search bis, that it did not perish that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer cimates, gather so quickly in a lemeric mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country.—He finally mounted horse bis, however, determined to catch up by the speed for the delay bis: but it was too late. The twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; the sun sets, the night begins; and he had ode far, the power of the storm was ab0ve – his thundors echo had barely an interval of rcst – his thick heavy rclin forced his way through the conopier foliage, while the 6lue forked flash vulinod to fall and radjate at his feet itself. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, 6y the dazzling of lightning, that he was jn the neighbour of a hovel that bardened from the dead rnasses 0f leclves wood of arid brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one for the handler in the city, or at least confident to get a shelter against the coat of the star. He barely approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shrieks of a woman who mingled with suffocated laughter, laughed at each other, continued in an almost vnbroken sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that agonized on his head high, he, with a sudden effort, seized the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness; the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; sor, though called ho, the sounds still tbe continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He sows himself in contact with someone whom he seizes himself; when a voice screams, \"Always flouted!\" He felt overwhelmed by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: he soaked life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was ljfted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the grurid: — the enemy bis fought over him, and knelt on his chest, hcld laid his hands up his throat — when the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole lhat gave light in the day, disturbed him; — he immediately rose up, arid, soothing his prey, rushed through the door, and at the time the crashing of the braris, as ho broke the wood, was rio along heard. The storm of Tobe was now extinguished; and Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble straw was loaded on any individual straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought away from her, who had drawn her shouts; he was again left in darkness; but what was her husband, when the light of the torches burst on the bim, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought to Jn a life. He closed his eyes, hoping that he would begin a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the shape of the samc, when he did not close lbem, stretchod by his side. There was no colour above his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a pensity about his thal foce seemed almost as endearing as the life that once lived there: — on the ber neck and chest was blood, and upan his throat was the marks of teelh having opened the vein: — to this the inen pointed, weeping, struck simultaneously with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A waf of litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of such brilliant and fair visions, now fermented with the flower life that had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were — his mind was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he led almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger bone a particle building, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parts that had been erected in search of her that a mother had missed. Their loathsome cry, as they approached the city, warned of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the pain of their child, it is impossible to describe it; but they have checked the cause of their child's death, they have looked at Avbrey, and pojnted at Corsica.\" They were inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a fever of the most violent, and was often of theirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe – by an incompetent ombjnation he began to beg his former companion to spare the being he loved. At othcr timos, he imprecato curses up0n hls head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, stunned at this time t0 arrives in Athens, ond, for any reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately places himself in the same house, and becomes his constant companion. When he recovered from the delirium bis, he horrified and surprised himself with the view that he had of the image that he now had c0mbined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rutbven, by bis genre w0rds, involving almost repenclnce sor the fault had caused their separation, and even more so by the attentiveness, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence of hls. His seigneury seemed to change from quinquel; he no longer appreciated this apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his recovery began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey could not depart from the old, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of rejoicing playing on his lips: he did not know why, but tbis srnile him hclunta. During the most difficult stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently obstinate to look at the tideless waves raised by the cooling brezc, or to obscure the progress of these orbs, circljng, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to strangle the eye of all.\nAubrey's mind, by its sh0ck, was much weaker, and this elasticity of the mind that had once so distinguished him now seemed to have dropped forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul as long as he wanted sollude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the middle of the ruiris he had previously attended, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if hc were looking for him in the woods, his long ftep would seem warrior on the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; tuna suddenly turning raund, wovld show, your wild imagination, his pale face and wounded lhroat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, all of which created so bitter assailations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he holds him bound by the cclre lender whom he had taken from hiin during his illness, that they should live with those parts of Greee neitber had seen again. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place where a reprint clings; but they hastened in this way to go from one place to another, but they did not seem to hold what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, 6 but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined only tbo inuentiori of individuals, whose interest was to exterminate the generosity of thase that they defended fr0m claimed dangers. As a result neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on an accassion they traveled with aly some guclrds, more to serve as guides than as a defenco. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their negligence; if they were barely the part engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistling of the closed bullets at their head, and by the echo report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards were afraid to have them, and by placing themselves under the bohind rocks, hod started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven ond Aubrey, imitating lheir exainple, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering from defilement: hut shameful to be tbus detiried by an enemy, who, with inseparable cries, told them advonce, being exposed to the insistible girl, is one of the thieves who could ride abovc and take the tbe to the back, they determined both lo rvsh before in search of tbe eriemy. Hardly had they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, whicb led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, in addition to taking into account the help or his own peril, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having been wounded at the top by Lord Ru tbven, thrown iminédiately their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey saon encouraged them to transport his wounded friend to the nearby hut; and having accepted the ransom of cl, ho was no longer troubled by their presence — they were content to keep the entranée until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for he had an order. Lord Rutbven'f the force quickly diminished; in two mortifjcatiori days followed, and death seemed to be set in motion with hasty steps. The conduct and appearance had not changed; it seemed as unconscious of the pain as it had been of the objects around it: but towards the end of the last evening, the Bis spirit became obviously uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his help with more than the usual sheath—\"Help yourself! You have saved me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my reading, I have taken into account the death of my existenco as litlle as lhat of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? \"I need a little money,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need a little money, my life is gone, I can explain everything, but if you were to hide me, you know, my humor was fréo from the stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had long been unknown in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him up 1f with exulent voloence: \"Swear by all your soul, by your natural fear, that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to a living being in any way, that which may happen, or whatever you do. \"The eyes seemed to burst out of the soekets of Tholr, \"I swear!\" said Avbrey, \"he was running down his pic1low, and was no longer breathing.\"\nAubrey rested, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his inind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oalh, a cold chill came upon him, as if the predatory feeling of something horrifying were waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body of Tbe, when a thief met him, and informed Hiin tbat that he was no longer there, after having been transported 6y himself and comrade, at his retreat, to the pirinacle of a neigbbouring mountain, ancestor to a promise thcy had given bis lardship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that shaves after his death. Avbrey was astonished, and took the Severa1 of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace af eitbcr eorpse or clothes, although the rabbers swore that they were pointing ortho idericial rock on whieh they had laid the hody. For some time his mind was perplexed in cnjectures, but he returned to the trail, convinced that they had buried Tbe's corpse for the sakc of clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had rnet with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appearedryly conspired to increase the superstitious lhal rnelanch0Iy who had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he occupied heselsiri by arranging the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case contaminating several weapons of force, more or less ada ptes to ensure the detachment of tho victjm. There were daggers on the ataghans. As he examined their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently or named in the same style as the daggor discovered in the fcltal hut – he trembled – rushing to get more evidence, he turned the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that she was bleeding, particularly shaped, the sheath he had in his hand. His eye did not seem to need another certainty: they sawmod looking to be bound to the dagger; however, he began not to believe; but the particular shape, that is, the same shades on the haft and the sheath is Werc in the splendor on both, clnd probably left root far away; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and one of his way back to Rome, his first investigations were the coricomania of the lady whom he had tried to rip out the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their forlune ruiried, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's brain almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to Ianthe's destroyer. He begged morose arid silent; and his only job was to vrerge the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Ca1ais; and a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon taunted him on the English shores; and he rushed into the house of his fathers, and there, for a Millel, seemed to lose, in the shades and carrots of his sister, all memory of the leg. If before, through her infallible ears, she gained her affection, now tal the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey did not have this winning grace that gaggens the gaze and opplauses the salon assemblies. There was noc of this slight shine whlch exists only in the heated atmosphere os a cr owd apartmcnt. His 6lue eye was lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to depart from the misfortune, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate a bad conscience of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, that he went astray where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was sedalo and pensjve. Wben alone, his face was never brilliantly brilliantly brillianced by the smile of joy; but who opened his asfectlon to him, and who iri ber presence would forget these deuils She knows that he destroyed his rest, who could have exchclrigoded his smile for the voluptuary's? It seemed that these eyes, — the face was then playing in the light of their own sphere. She was still only a sting, and had not been...\nIndeed, the gvardlans were more able to delay his presentation until his brother's return, while he could be a prailleur. It was therefore not resolved that the riext lounge, Qujch was fast clpproaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey ralhcr bave would remain in his father's house, and feed on the melancholy that covered him. He was not afraid to get bogged down in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the mind had been so torn apart by the hc events; but to be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his flster. They soon arrived in town, and pro-\nFor the ncxt day, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive: a riot had taken place for a long time, and all those who threw themselves in the smile of the kingship were hastening. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he stood in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that same place—he felt that he was only gripped by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded iri hls ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would blow up hiin, which he perceived, at a bit of distonne, the same frigure that had drawn his attention to this place on his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry blood, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forced a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and fixed his barrids up his head, just like he was afraid his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the thc's dagger — his oath.—He woke up himself, he could not believe it possible — to be resurrected dead!—He thought his imagination had sung away the spirit of the imagc bis was based on. It was impossible for him to be reol — he determined, therefore, to return to the society inta; for tough he tried to ask for worried Lord Ruthven, the name hung on the hif lips, and he could not fright himself in the cheerful insormation. He left a few nights after putting his sistcr at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated to a recreation, and then he led himself to his eating tbougbts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he fled, and entered another room, and found his sister overcome by Severa1, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, who, asking her to move, turned around, arid revealed to him traits which he abhorred. He went forward, seizcd bis sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her towards the edge: the door which he found obstructed by the crowd of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was passing through them, he heard again the voice of Tbat whispering near him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"Ho dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, Saon came to him.\nAu6rcy has become almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a sufferect, how much more completely he was overwhelmed, now than the certainty of the life of tho monster again pressod on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. Hisoath was astonished at himself;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of Oll he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His very sister havc was hit by Bim. But even if he broke his oath, and described his supplications, who would believe him? He tried to use his own heel to free the world from such misery; but the teeth, remcmbered, had already mocked. For days he remained in the state; he closed his room, he saw only one, and he ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his soke, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stilitude and madness, he lefl hjs home, wandered fr0m street to slreet, anxious to steal this irritating which haunted the hive. His becclme ncglected dress, and he wandered, as often exposed to midday sun as to midday humidity. He was no longer so that he could recognize him; at first he took refuge in the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where he had fallen over him. His sister, anxious for his possessions, employed people who followed him; but they were far away by hiin, who was moving away from a schlftcr pursuing, from all thought. His driver, however, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea that he left by his absence the one of his friends, with a fiend among the ins, of which the president thcy was unconscious, he determined t0 to enter again into the priesthood, set in close watch, anxlous in advance, despite his oath, all wham Lord Ruthven approached intimay. But when he entered a room, his hamburger and discontented eyes were so striking, his irritations so visible, that his sister was obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the remariccnce provod uriavailing, the gvardians thought appropriate to interpose, and, fear that the spirit of tbat was encomir alieried, they tangbt it high time to resuer agairi this truft that had been before irnposed vpon them by Aubrey's parentf.\nChallenged to save the hive from the wounds and sufferings that he had encountered in his wanderings, and which prevented him from exposing to the geriatric eye these marks of what they would oonside madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the thc's dung, and take care of him oorist. He hardly seemed to riot him, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was given the chamber. He would lie for days, unable to be awake. He had become moved, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier; — the sign anly os affixion and recol1e remaining appeared at the entrance of the hif sister; then he sometimes began, and, sizirig his hands, with the appearances tbat scverely afflicted, he wanted her not to languish. \"Oh, nat toucbhim, is your love for me great, don't come near blm!\" When, however, fho asked whom he was speaking to, his only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And once again, he sank in a state, when he could even wake him up. This lastod inonths rnany: graduated however, as the lover passed, hif inaherences hecame lefs frequent, and bis mirid jeta osf part of his morosity, while his guardobserved, thclt several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then sinile.\nThe time had riearly passed, when, on the last day of the ear, an ane of her gvardians entering her room, began t0 conv erso with her doctor on the meIancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in a terrible situation, when her sis ter went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this brand of retuming iritellect, of whicb that they feared he bad hoen private, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his cxpressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to the sister dry bis. Tbey didn't answer, hut in a few minutes his sister was with him. He apparently agonizes the beirig's capale affected by the influence of his first smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, slowing down his brother's thought of being once again alive at the attention of the sanctities. He egan t0 spoke with all his warmth wonled, and congratulated his vpon hermarriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and performance of evory; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; 0 pening it, what was his surprise to cash in the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, ond trampled under f0ot. On her asking why he thus destroyed the re-emergence of a future husband, he looked as if he had not underestimated her — then by grabbing her heels, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of dimension, he told her to swear that she would never marry that m0nster, for he—Bvt he could not move forward—he saw if the voice asked her to remember his oath again—he suddenly turned around, thirirking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the management of the guards and the physiclan, who had heard the whole, and that it was only the return of his trouble, entered, and prohibited her from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave retirement. He fell on his troubles with them, he begged, he took them away to delay them, but for a day. They, attributing this to the imaginary madness lhcy had taken possession of his mind, tried to pacify him, and rotated.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused Béori with all the others. That he heard the sick of Aubrey, whom he willingly kept to be the cause; 6and when he learned that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had acquired this training. He hastened to the hovfe of his former companion, arid, by the constant atteridaric, and the pretension af great affection for the brother and interest in destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dangcrf and toils to get up—could speak of himself as an individual with no sympathy for any ringing on the crowded atrium, except with her to whom to address;—could be t1l how, since he knows her, his existence,hcld began to seem worthy of preseuration, jf it was simply that he could listen to his soothing acoents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, thclt he won his effectsjons. The title of the elder bronoh fellilig for him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state), which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked him for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjugating her, as she valued her own happiness, bent her honor, and thehanour of those who are now in the tomb, wha orice held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their hause, to delay, but for a few hours this marriage, on which he stripped the heavy mast. The serrants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought he would bet that he would no longer harass Miss A ubroy's mind by, what he considered, greasing a maniac. Nigbt passed some ori without resl to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be more easily conccinated than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the Cuslodia bone a powerless woman. Ho seized the opportunity, if one were bound was out of the kingdom, and in a mountain fell himself in the aparlinent where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approved himself without bounds, and, taking his arm by force, cast him out of the chamber, speechlesf with the ragc. On the stairs of Tbe, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if ever my fiancée n°0 day, your sister is dishonored. Women aro frai1!\" Thus he pushed HLM to his servants, wbo, awakened by the old womo, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding uerite, had broken a blaod-vessei, and it was transmitted to 6ed. Tbis was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The mclriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symlomas of near-death approach. He wanted to be called the Guclrdians of his fisher'f, and when the hour of midnight had been beaten, to repeat in a composite way what the reader of Tbe had believed, and that he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect the Mifs Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, Aubrey's sister had slipped her thirst for cl VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT DF SEIGNOR BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &o.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, on the edge of Her Majesty's Island, in the year 18l2, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of Tbe of that name. The beauty of this arid plcc, some supp1y of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, leads many British vefsels to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, jts bonts largely repay for the deviation of a voyage. We disembarked; as usual, the bay b0ttom, and while the tho mcn werc used to water, and the shipowner negotiated for cattle with the natives, the clergy and I took arclmble for Ibe cove called Homer's Scbool, and other pieces, where we had been besieged. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Grecas our guido, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who for fear that the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he would have taken me with him; but I dared not leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. Tbo cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old husband in oharge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zecbins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not contributing; because he sank in his felucca very often t0 the different islands.\"\nThis acount excited our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose any tiine in haste the hovse where our c0untryinan had resided. We carried kjndly receivedivod by an old man, who led us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: entrance hall, a drawer room, a sitting living room, and a bedroom, wjth clspacious o1oset annexed. They were all decorated in a simplifying way: green walls, marble lables on either side, myrtle largo in the ccnlre, and a small henath suntajn, wbich could be made to play the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small br0nze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a dozen chcilirs of English cane, arid an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The Tbe bedroom had only a great maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a common bed pjllow—thc throughout Greece. In the living room we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, fliled wilh books and papers, whicb were then in a large sailor's chest in the enclosure: it was open, but we did not think noseeues justified by examining the content. On the tablet of the recesf were Voltaire, Shakfpeare'f, Boileau's, and Rousseau's complete works; the ruins of Volney's 0f Empjres; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Kl0pstock; the n0vels of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schi1ler; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an edition of Italjan, printed at Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantjnople, mucb tom, but no book in English of any descripsion. Most of these books were filled with notes of bologol wilh, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Tbe Mefsiah was literally scratched all the way, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also noted.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he went away, and he placed them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he surrenders; for he is so parlicular, that if I move a blow without order, he would be frowning on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I have once done a service; I have the product of this weapon for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechjnes which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the waod, and which the lord brought here from Adrionople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the externolly house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble piles flanked with black plinths and fret work cornicks (as it is now usual in the Greek architect,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, under the awning ari of strong coarse linen. Most shoals are furnished with tbuses, because the greens spend their evenings in smokjng, light wines to drink, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, ond taking advantage of the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the tho huso, a small creek glissa, the grapes, oranges and lime gathering on its borders, and under the shade 0ftwo lorgc myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on whoh we were told, tho lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, crying, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view from the Tbis seat was whclt perhaps called \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, a cave of olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek tempio appeared in majestic decay. A small stroam from the ruins descends into the cac-\nAdes, until he was lost in the woods near mountain 6ase. The sea smoolh in the form of glass, and a horlzon not shot by a single cloud, finishes the iew in front; and a little left, thr0vgh a vista of loftychesnut and palm trees, sevcrallpetits islarides were distinctly observed, establishing the light blue wave welth spots os emerald Greek. I rarely enjoyed a view more than what I did; but our enquirios wero fruiterless as to the name of the person Tbc who hcld resided in this romantic soljtude: no one knew his name but Domi nick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our corid uetor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" he said, \"carinot yov, old frjend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We have not much time to live up to Armenian, 6uton our return to the city we have learned several details of the secluded lord. He had shared the young girls who were the last on the island, and always danced with them at the wedding party of Tbe. He gave a cow to a man, borses lo others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these orticles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who got lost in a storm, and he often gave Grcek Testaments to poor children. In short, he clppecrcd to us, fram all that we collected, lo were a very eccentric and caring character. Dne circvmstance we have learned, that our old frlend at coltage tangbt own n0t to disclose - Yes. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the horde of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him himself how to use it.\nSucb was the information with which we left the quiet island of Mitylene bone; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this crawler at Greeoe could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the disposition of philanthropy, and all those eccentricities that nark peculiclr genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, student of WYATT'S, wbo had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"Tbe iridividval,\" he said, \"out of which yau are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the Tbe island of Tenedos, and I also visited bim in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the tho reclufe of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we not regress without having been more urious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I render this state of mind, by improving it not entirely intolerant, and in court in the good name of his seigneury, whicb was grossly clumsy. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with Hvman nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be p1ainly gathored from these little anecdotes. All siners' feelings have the heart, so elegantly portrayed in Lordship's poems, seems to have lejr sitting in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actionf: arid his courteousness the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a bejng on whose heart the Hatb religion sealed his, and ovor whose head Volunteer has thrown his coat. No man can read the pleasant \"trclits\" before, feeling proud of him as an emissary. As far as the hjf likes or pleads, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The report must always be lucid, especially when it is directed against man's intregrile m0rcll; and whoever dares to justify himself before a horrible trihunal whore appears, only can censor the orres of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart on a self-approved conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Slreot.",
    "13": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it nat, however, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has taken its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a body of Latiri could not break if it was buried in their territory, it increased graduated, and farmed the subject of many wonderful storjes, stjll extclnt, detho dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the Wcst jt spread, with some variation of the mass, alI on Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres almost soaked up some of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consvmptianf; while the human blood suckers fattened it — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, in order to slow down tho blaod of all passages of their body, and even of the very porous lhc of their skins.\nIn the JournaI of London, Marcb, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place clt Madreyga, iri Hungary. It seems, that above a cxamination of the commander-in-chief and of the mogistrates of the place, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, abated five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arriold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassavia, on the borders of the Turkish Sorvia, he had boen tormented by a vompyre, but had found a way lo to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of the vampyr grava, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from scorning a vain hesolf; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, people rnany complained of being tormented by bim, and a statement was made, that four hcld people were deprived of life by his ottacks. To avoid other malice, the inhclbitants have consulted their Hadagni, taok up the body, and found (os is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sree srom corrupti0n, and emitting to the moutb, nose, ears clnd, pure and f1orid 6lood. As the evidence was retained, they resorted to the acestomized remedy. A stake was led by Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been olive. It did, they ripped off his head, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grove. The same measures were adopted for those who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become vpon agents of others who survived them.\nUniversal belief js, thclts a person sucked by a uampyre himself generates a vainpyrc, and sucks in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, there are better indications to illustrate the subject of observatories of preserit than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to limit his infernal ausitation to beings whom he most praised on earth – lhofe to boast that he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A suppofition refers to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn to pieces, and shall haunt the place of natjvo, and suck the blood of all thy seed: there thy daughter, and thy wife, shall drain the stream of life by midnight; yet the rust of the banquet that persecutes shall feed thy living corsus, Thy victjms, They shall expire, they shall know the devil for their sire; as the cursirig thco, and Tbou curse them, thy flowers shall be sown on the stem. But a man for your crime falls, the youngest, the best loved of all, will bless you with the name of a father: Your word will envelop your heart! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of the eye, and the last glazed glance that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with an unhumiliated hand will tear the braids of yellow ber hair, of which, in life, a padlock when the deep pledge of affection has been carried — but now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy tooth shall be gnclsing, and thy lip shall be set on hold; and after thy tomb shall go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror shall depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also translated in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having come back from the grave for the purpofe to torment him that she loved better when it exists-\nThat's right. But the tbis can't be supposed to be the result of the sin of her first, she being rottrayod thrugbout tho the whole tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The true Taurnefort gives a long account of his journeys of several clever cases of vamp yrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this sub-I ct, besides a variety of oncdotes, and traditional accounts illustivo of his effects, hos presented some dissertatioris leamed, tending to prove that he is a classic, as well as the Borbarian error.\nMany curiouf and iriteresting opinions on this singularly horriblc superstition could be added; although the present can substitute for the imiles of a note, neo-testerously devoted to explanatiori, and which can now be concludeddo by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are sooveral other synonyms with lt, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouco1oka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThings have happened in the independence of the dissident.\nOn a London winter, the leaders of the ton appeared to the various parties a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. He looked up, the mirror surrounded him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted its attention, so that it could by a glance stifle it, and cast fear into those breasts where the infidels reigned. Thosc, who felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where it darkened: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce inside w0rks of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a loaded ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities made him be invited to each house; all wanted to see him, and those who flouted the habit of violating the excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were pleaded to have something in their presence capable of committing their intention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never won a warinerint, eilher of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emoti0n os passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many women hunters after n0taricty tried to gain her attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what might end up affecting: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all shewri monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, pierced himself in bis manner, and everything except put on the dress of a morit bank, to attract her attention:—but in vain:—when she stood in front of him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, still he saw as if they were not pierced;—even her unapplauseded impudder was flouted, and she left the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of her eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to her: however, fuch was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman about the innocent girl, that few know that he never joined women. He had, however, the reproduction of a winning language; and if it was even that he caused the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his hatred appeared to be vice, he was also often among those women who sormtho boast their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shudder her by vices lher.\nAt about the same time, a young gentleman from Aubrey's riame arrived in London: to be a 0rphan 1ft wilh a sister anly in possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in the chi1dhood. Lefl clso to luiclf by the guards, who thought that it was duly meroly to take caro of his fortune, while they resold the more jinportant charge of bis mlrid to the carc of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. So he had this great romantic quarrel of horror and frankness, which every day ruins so many fears of millions. He believed that it was a symptomatology with virtue, and that the vice was chained by Providence for the piedturesque tbe effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he said that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and small-coloured patches. He thought, in the flrie, that poets' drearns were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay waxes, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their favourites languisbants or grotesques: the daugbters at the same tjme, by their brigbing confluences as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he operated his lips, soon led him to notions of madness of his talents clinginging to his merit. Attached to cls he was to the love of his salaried hours, it was started to find, that, exeept in the candles of tallow and wax that freaked, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the warning of snuffing, there was n0 foundation iri real life for clny of these congreries of pleasant pies and descriptions c0 held in these volvmes, of whooh he had formed his study. By finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up dreams, when extraordinary tobe being we described above, he hurried him in his career.\nHe looked at it; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gclve few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari the taclt enslaved to their existence nee, implicitly avoiding their c0nlact: allowing his imagination to imagine each thirig lhat flattered his propensity t0 extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of a romance, and decided to observe the affeasance of his fantasy, rabbling thari the person the beforo. Hc beoame has known him, paid him for slitting, and so far attached to his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon sounded, from the prayer notes on the street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to gain a little information about this singular character, which, until now, had made its curriosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to execute the tovr, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice in order to put themselves on equality with the elderly, and not to allow the larn to apprehend as if fallen from the heavens, quanduer intrigues scandalous are begden as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skjI sown by wearing them. And Aubrey, immediately speaking about his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to ask him to join him. Tired by such a mark of esteem on the part of him, who, appareenl1y, had nothing to coinmori with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a time of birds they passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Rutbven, and now he has found, that about much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered conclusions different from the apparent reasons for his conduct. His oompanion was provsc in his liberality; — the idol, the vagrant, and the beggar, received srom his hand more tban cnough to revive immedate desires. But Aubrcy could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the vultuous, reduced to indignation by the dishonest assistants of virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the proligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he wos sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. There, the charity of his Lordship, which was more impressed by his spirit, proved inevitable for those on whom it was granted, for they were led to scaffolding, or sunk into the lowest and most abject misery. In Brusfels and other cities through which TBey passed, Aubrey was surprised by the ardour with which his companion sought the counters of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in all the spirit of the table of Faro: he bctted, arid always won wilh succesf, except where the best known was his aritagonist, and he lost cven more than he won; but he was still with the vnchangeface samo, with which he generally looked at society around: he was not, however, his when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; then his vory desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the ind was spread, and his eyes shone with more fire than the tbat of the cat that fell with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, he left the former rich young child, torn from the oircle which he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a donjori, the fate had drawn him to the reach of this fiond; while reny a fathor sal frantjc, arnidst the eyes scattered from mute children hurigry, without a single farming 0f his last immense wealth, where he even bought enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the tablc game; but immediately lost, in the ruirier of rnclny, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the innocent: it might be that the reverence of a degree of certlan knowledge, whieh, however, was not able to fight the trick of the most experienced ced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this beggar and beggar who proved the ruin of al1, and did not make his own profit; — but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was alwclys the samc: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he got rio greater gratification of it than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break thot mystery, which his excluded imaginatiori began to assure the appearance of some supernatural.\nThey came to Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his bif companion; he left him in daily joy on the morning circle of the Ari-Italian Countess, while he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. What, then, was there letters that came from England, that he opened impatiently; the tree came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the othors came from his guardians, the latter astonishing hjm; has it already entered into his imagination that there was evil power in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seize his friend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible seducjon powers made bi-firing habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his conternpt for adultery had not been generated by hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, despite his gratification, that bis victim, tho partor of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinacle of unwelded vlrtuc, to the lowest abyss of irifamy and degradation: in the end, tbat all thososo females whom hc had sought, apparently because of their virtue, evil, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed all the defunctness of their vices to the pubic gaze.\nAubrcy determined the uporliving, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous ori point tearing the eye. He resoIvod invents a bit of pretcxt assimilable to abander it in altogotber, purposlng, in the way, to look closer bim, and not to let pass any slighl irconstances by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soori perceivod, that his seigneury was eridvorous to work on the inexperience of Tbe Iady's donut of which he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, she is a single woman who mixes with society; he is obliged to pursue his projects in secret; but Aubrey's eye dazzled him in his windigrees, and soori discovered that an assigration had been designated, which would probably end in the rvin of an inn0cent, tangb without gjrl thought. Without losing any lime, he entered Lord Ruthven's applause, and tirelessly asked him for his intentions, which he took back from the lady, at the same time informing him that he was aware of his desire to meet her that evening. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he put clll w0vld havc on such on occasioniori; and after having been pressed if he read t0 marry her, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, writing a riot, to say, that from that time on, he had to refuse to aspire to his Lordship in the reininder of the proposed lhejr, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and callilig on the lady's mother, informed him of the Il ho kncw, not only wlh seen his daughter, 6utalso concerning tbe charaeler of his L0rdshjp. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Rutbuen the next day simply sent a high-servclent to notify a separclian of his full consent; bvt did not suggest any suspicion of his plans being thwarted by Au6rey'f interposllion.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and found himself in Athens. Hc then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the documents fclded os ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freedom only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering sojl or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so kind and delicate, that she could form fashion1 for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mahoinet'f, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for ariy 0ne to think that she could belong to these wbos had no souls. As she danced in the plain, or trjpped along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eyc, appears the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal follows but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ionthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unc0nscjous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaso of him, who stuffed the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in the cantemplation of hor sylph-like figure. Often, his braids would flirt, like sho flitted around, expose in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly erase booef, he might excuse lbe oblivfulnefs of the antiquarian y, wbo let escape brake his mirid the very object that he had befare tho-\nThis is a passage of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pousarias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded ants and stifling balls. As he drew the remains of which he wished to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, sweeping the magic effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered having seen his childhood; and then, turning t0 svbjects which, obviously, made a greater eruption on his mind, told him all the adrenalal tale of his laugh. It is often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and which had confined herself last year to feeding herself with a sweet madness to prolong her months of oxidence, the blood of bis would cool down, while he attached himself to such fantasies and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe quoted to her the dwarfs of old men, who had at last detected a living amang lhemselves, astering several bones of their relatives relatius and their children, found marked by the stamp of the appetite of their fiend; and when she sounded so inordinate, she begged him to believe it, for he had noticed that those who had degued to question their existence had always had true evidence, and had given him assurance. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was amplifying, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthveri; he, comments r, slill, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth iri her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to Ianthe; innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari without instruction Greek daughter, the silt was sounded so more and more attached to the form aIm0st falry before him. He will sometimes tear it out of her, and, forming a plan for the search for the antiques of the orne, he will leave, decided nat at retum until his object wcls attiriod; but he always found it impossible to repair his atte-\nIn his mind, he kept an image which seemed to be the only rlghtful teacher of his thousand. Ianthe waf unconsci 0us of his love, and was always the frank infantile sclme that he had known the first time. She seemed reluctant to separate from the hive; but it was because she no longer had one mind that she could visit her favorite haunts, wbilst hcr guardian was busy skotching or undoing a fragment that had still wiped out the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present seueral, affirmed their existence, pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hovres; that they heard the name of the plaque, that they all at once harassed him not to turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through the wood, wbere no Groek would never remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of tho vampyres in their nocturnal orgjes, and denounced the evils of moft hairy as imminent on him that dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw TBem shvdder at his darlng so to mock the superior, infernal power, whose dwarf even apparently shook the blood, he silenced himself.\nThen he inorned Aubrey's ensemble on his unparticipated tour; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terrors. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, and the night was over, which allowed the powcr of these bellgs to be put into action. — He promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that day-lighl so0n fine, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer cliinotes, gather so quickly in the mass of atremendous, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.—He, however, mounted his h0rese, determined to catch up by the speed for the hif delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climatos, is almost bare; immediately the svn sets, the night begins; and it has had adva-\nThe power of the storm was above, its thunder echoes had little rest interval, for heavy and thick rains forced its passage through the solilage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse rushed, and he carried with terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped through the fotigue, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose vp from the masses of dead hares and brushwood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to Icast confident to get herIter from the eruption of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a morning silence, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with the whirlwind, the exulting mockery of a laugb, continued in an almost non-bro keri sound;—he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that agairi rallIed on his head, he, with o sudden eff-\nOrt, witches operate the door of the hul. He weakens in the darkness of the ostrich; however, the smile of the guida. He was apparently unwise; for, tangb he cal1d, sti1l the s0unds have cortinated, and no opinion has been taken like him. He found himself in coritact with a sorno, which he immediately seized; when ouoice shouted, \"Always floundered!\" And he felt fluctuated by him whose strength seemed superhuman; and he decided to sell his life as hard as he could, and he wrestled; but it was invaded; and he was lifted up from his arid, hurled with amazement against him. the earth: — his cnemy fell upon him, and knelt on his panties, had placed his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many penestral torches through the hole that gave light in the day had troubled him; — he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rolled through the door, and at the moment the branches of the twisting tbe bone, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was no longer there; and Aubrey, who was not able to move, was soon heard by those who had none. They entered, and the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the tbalch loaded on every induidual straw with heavy soot flakes. At the fire of Aubrey lhey sought the one who had attracted him to his cry; he was agaln left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches ordained him more bvrst on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor in a lifely Corsica. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a visiori coming from hls disturbed the imagination; but he saw again the shape of a sarne, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no calorie on the cheek, not even his lip, but there was a silence on his face lhat seemed as alinotic as the life that once inhabited lhero: — at the top of his neck and chest was blood, and at the top of his throat were the marks of teeth that opied the vein: — at this lhe the men pointed, shouted, at the same time struck with horror, \"To Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was formed in general, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the hcr which had recently been at hjm the bone object so many luminous vjsions and fajry, now faIlen with the thal of life of fower 0f had died in it. He did not know what the thoughts of bis were — his reindeer was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacclncy — he unconsciously held the olinost in his hand a bare dagger of a particulo-clr coristruction, which had been mad nd in the hut. They were quickly met by different parties who were wrongly engaged in the investigation of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"It would be impossible to harden their grief; a hut, when they discovered the cause of the child's death, looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolable; 6oth died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was sejzed with a more violent sever, arid wcls often delirlous; in these iritéruels he could call Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination it seemed lomen of his forepanion to hatch the being he loved. In another time he permeated the curses on his pearl, and cursed him as his dowry. Lord Ruthven, staggered at this tjme lo arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the bone state Aubrey, immeasurably placed in the same house, and begging his attendant. When the latter recovered from the dcliriuin bis, he was horrified and fermented at the sight of the one whom he had now combined with that of aVornpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving the greatest repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, oridism, he showed, soon re-enacted to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite shaken; he no longer appeared in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the old man, except that he was sometimes surprised your encounter with his ga2e staring at him, with a malicious smile of exultatiori playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage, after the restoration of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook with great apprehension to observe the madlesf waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the still svn;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the oycs of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by the shock of the tbis, was greatly weakened, and this elastic spirit that had so distinguished him now seemed to be running away forever. He was today like a lover of solitude and silence like Lord Rulhven; but although he wanted him, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he could hear him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the wo0ds, his small step would be apparant wandering in the middle of the undcrwood, in the quest for the modest purple; lhon suddenly turned ravnd, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale faco and his wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all the seams of which he had the bitter spirit assooialions iri. He prophesied to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during his illness, so that they would not visit the tbose parts of Greece and that they did not yet have so much. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for every place to which a memory could be attached: bul although they rushed so-\nThey looked like they were doing what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they began to take advantage of these relationships, which they imagined to be only the inuention of the induiduals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from the preterized dclangers. In consecence not to take into account the advice of the inhclbitants, they once travelled with only a few guards, mare to throw themselves as guides only as defence. When entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks at the bottom of the neighboring prccipice, they had reason to repeat their negligence; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle bullets of 0f near their head, and 6y echoed several cannons. In an irislant, their guards had left them, engulfed, placing themselves hehirid rocks, bad started to shoot in the direction that the TBE report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, are tired for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement:bul shame of bellg thus held 6y an enemy, who, with insulting cries bade tbem advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the ro6bers would have to climb up and take them to the rear, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to the bis assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised when he saw the faces of the robbers around him — the guards hastened, on the wounded of Lard Ruthven, immediately threw down their arms and surrided themselves.\nBy promifs of a great reward, Aubrey soon forced them to corrupt his wounded frieride in a neighborhood hut; and, by agreeing on a ransom, he was no longer djsturbous by the presence of bir – they simply kept the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strenglh decreased rapidly; in two days mortificationensued, the arid death seen advancirig with hasty stops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like an unconscious of pain cls he had been of the objecls obouthim: but to say the end of the last evening, his mind became appareryly unoasy, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was industrialized to loosen his assistantclnco with mare that usual solicitude—\"Assist mc! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I take into account the death of my existence as littoral as that of the passing day; but yau can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little of my life flourishes, I cannot explain the whole, if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had not been known for some time in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence: \"Swcarby all your sovl reueres, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or of the death of any living being, in any way whatsoever, or of what you can see.\" \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their slippers: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; hc was laughing on his p1low, and did not breathe a mare.\nAubrey connected rest, but he was asleep rioting; the many circumstancos assisted his knowledge-\nAnd he arose with this man, and knew not why; and when he swore, there trembled a caine upon him, as though he came from the present of something terrible that was awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter tho hovel into which he had left the corpse, when cl Robber met him, and informed him that it was not dangerous there, having transported by himself and comradcs, at his retreat, to the pinaole os a mountain nelghbouring, according to a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the coldest ray of the moon that flaked his dcath. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the souveral of men, determined to go and bury him up from where he was. But when he went up to the Suinmit, he had no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would pee on the same rock on which Ibey had laid the body. For his mind was stunned in conjecturos, but finally back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in wbich all apparently conspiracy to increase that superstitious melancholy tbal had seized on his mind, he decided to leave her, and foon arrived at Smyrncl. While he was waging lamentations for a ship to transport him to Otrarito or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Rvthven. Among other things, there was a case containing sevorous weapons of offence, more or less adaptation to ensure the death of the victim. T here were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an tame sheath in the style of celebrity like the dclgger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — having rushed to get other evidence, he found the weapon, the arid horror bis can be imagined when he discovered that it corresponded, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in the bis hand. His eycs did not seem to need any other certainty: the teeth seeing to get angry at the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the shades of samo varyirig on the haft and sheath were similar in lender sp on both, and lofl without room f0r doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe feared that Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were on the lady hc had ottempted lo snatch of the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of it since the dowry of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost shattered acr so mary horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to rush the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to sow the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a hreezc, who seemed obedient to his wi1l, a foon swollen bim on the English coast; ond he hastened to the monsion of his fathers, and there, for a mummcnt, seemed to lose, iri the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If sho bef0re, by her infertile caresses, had gained her affection, now tal the woman began to appear t0, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey doesn't have this winning grace that wins the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was noc of this 6rilliancy whi ch light only exists in the amassphere of the litter of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mlnd below. There was a melclncholy charm on this subject which did not seem to come from misfortune, bvt from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter mind. His step was a riot that could be attracted by a butterfly or a color – it was sedative and pensive. When alone, her face was never brilliantly shaken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and in her presence she would have relieved those sorrows that she knew to destroy her roste, who would have exchanged her smjle for that of the voluptuous? It seems that these eyes—the face of the lock was then sinking into the legion of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and bad, did not appear in the world, for she had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when hc could have his protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be the time when she was trying in the \"abuse scene.\" Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the rnansi0n of his fathers, and fed myself who surpassed him. He could not feel the frivolities of the fashionable strarigers, when her mind had been so torn by the avont she had wilnesfed; but ho determined to sacrifice her own c0mfort to the proteclion of her sister. They soon arrived in Towri, and prepared for the next room, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened to tbitter. Aubrey was there with her sister. While standing in a corner by the Heifels, without taking into account all that was around him, elongated in the reincarnation that the first time we had seen Lord Ruthuen was in the same place, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a way that he recognized well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He has little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that haunted him, when he perceived, in a distanc litt1e, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his lmbs most refusing to wear the weight of the thorium, was forced to take a sling on his arm 0f, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, set in the house. Ho pacod the rooin with hvrriod steps, and staring his hands on his hood, as if he feared his thoughts were 6ursting from his brain. Lord Rvthveri again before him—circumstances sta-\nHe woke up himself, ho couldn't rock him, the riso dead again!\"\"He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for although he managed to ask about Lord Ruthuen, the name hung on his lips, and he could succeed in obtaining jnformation. He went a few nights later with his sister at the donkey of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he took off the jnto for a break, and here he gave himself to his own devouring purchases. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he went away, entered another room, quadrified his sister surrounded by several, apparently in serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a shuddering step, forced her to say the tear: at the door he was kindled by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, he heard again this voice whispering by him: «Remember your oath!»\"He dared to turn, but, pressing, sister, he came to the house.\nAubrey's almost dlstractod. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much m0re completely was he absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on his thovghts. Her sisler's attentists were no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited him to explain to her what had dared her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more we bought it, the more disoriented it was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this dear torurre, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? He could've touched his sieve. But even if he violated his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. He remained in this state for a few days; locked in his room, he saw only one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes trodden with tears, begged him, for his own good, to support nausea. Finally, being no longer able to carry calm and solude, hc left his house, wandering street to street, anxious t0 steal this image that haunted him. Hjs's dress became neglected, arid to be wandering, bone often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; first he re-tubated wilh in the evening at Tbe's house; but finally he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue 0 took him. His sister, anxious for his sclfety, employed people for the follow; but they were soon removed by him wbo fled from a prvsuer faster than any—srom thaught. However, his conduct changed with welder. Hit with the idca that he was afraid by his obsence all the friends of hif, with a fiend am0ngst them, of wboseprosence they were unconscious, he decided to engage again in society, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite his oh, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful arid eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that the sister of hjs was finally obliged to beg HLM to refrain from seeking, for her, the society cl that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the Gvardians decided to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he had daily surrounded in his wandering gs, and to prevent him from exposing to the eye of general the traces of what they consider madness, they engaged a doctor to pass into the house, and to throw away his tough ear. He hardly noticed that there was really no spirit of a lerrable sub-jcct. His inconsistency is so great that he was entrusted to his chambermate. Thero would often lie for days, unable to be awake. He had fainted, his eyes looked like a lustrous chandelier; there were only signs of affection and remembrance left on his sister's entrance; then he would begin at hometimes, and, taking hold of his hands, with lo0ks that sevorously afflicted hor, he wished hor nat to praise him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if you love me, don't come near him!\" When, blindly, Sbe asked whom he was speaking to, his only answer was: \"Truth! Trve!\" And once again he sank in a state, wbence not even sbe could wake him up. This lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year had passed, his inconsistencies became frequent, and his mind cast osf a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a definite riumber, arid and then smiling.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, 6egan to talk with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Avhrey being in such a terrible situation, when if sister went the next day to be hammered. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return to the intellect, they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in solety, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by expressing his intention lo to be present on the nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his fisher hit him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to at least her sixth, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought that her brother was once again a1ive to the feclings of the affétion. He began to speak with all the warmth of the gained bis, and to gather it on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion upori his chest; 0 the while, wbat was his surprise to see the traits of Tbe of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled him on the vnder foot. On her asking him why he lhus destroyed the look of hcr futurehvsband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of face, he told him to swear that she would not marry that annuitant, for he—but he could not move forward—he was able to sow as if this voyce repeated his oath to him—he suddenly fainted raun d, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him bvt did not see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and physiciari, who had heard the wholc, and who thought it was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forcing Bim from Miss Aubrey, desired that she leave Hiin. He fell on his pens to them, he begged, he begged them to get rid of themselves, but for the day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined had taken the passion of his mind, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had glued in the morning after the dredging room, and had 6een refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he learned to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be confused with those among whom he had galvanized this information. He settled in the house of his former companion, and, by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, gradually rose up in Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongve had dclngers and you1 to tell—could say to himself as an induidua1 having a rio sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with herself that he addressed himself;—could know how, sjnce he knew her, his existenceericc, had begun to be wary of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his oozing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of destiny, that ho gained his affections. The title of the e1der branch along it, he obtained a large mass, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed stote) which was to take pl as the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor arid his guardians, began to bribe the servants, hut in vain. He asked for pen and paper; he was given HLM; he wrote a letter to his sjsler, conjuring her, as she interpreted her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of tbose now in the grave, which once held her in the arms of tbir as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which the heaviest curses were felt. The servants promised that they would deliver her; by overturning her the physjcian, he thought that he would be bet that he would no longer harass Miss Aubrey's spirit by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. Nigbt passed without rest to the occupied inmates of thc houfe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more eclsi1y bc designed than deorjbed, the notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew the frantic alrnost. The curiosity of the servants finally came their vjgilance, they graciously stole, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He was scaling the occasion, with the connected past was out of the room, and in a moment found hesels in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by the farce, rushed him out of the chamber of Tbe, sp-\nEchlesf with rage. On the stairs Lord Ruthven murmured in his ae r: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not the day of my bride, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" Thus he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woma n, had come in search of hjm. Aubrey does not have a longcr of support himself; his rage did not find the vent, bad broken a blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. He was not entrusted to his sister, who was not present, whom he had on his back, because the doctor feared to actuate the ber. Tbe's marriage was celebrated, and the bride and husband Ieft London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted the guards of his sisler to be cashed, and when the hour of midnight had its green light, he consistently resumed what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when he was arrested, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had made himself happy, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world began before him, went to the resting place of Choofehjs, and Providence its guide.\"\nBy sailing across the Greek archipelago, aboard Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we place inlo the barbour of Mitylene, on the island of this dwarf. The beauty of this placo, and the supply of certairi with cattle and vegetables that must always be found, led many British ships to visit it, men of war and merchonlmcn; and it is rather out of the lrack for ships linked to Smyrne, its premiums largely reimburse the deviation of a v0yage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the pvrser negotiated for cattle with the natiues, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble in the cave called Homer's Sch0ol, and other piacef, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (smali mound so named) we met wjth and hired a young Greek as our guide, that0 told us to have come from Scia with an English lord, who left the jsland four preuious mclys upon our arrival iri hls se1-\nThat's right. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he took me with him; but I dared not leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He's weird, but he's a very good boy. The house above the hill, facing the riuer, belongs to him, and he left of it the old ari man: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (obo ut L250 English currency,) and recast there aboul fourteen months, but not confint; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis account greatly exorbited our curiosity, we did not waste time at the hostirig in the house where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old renan, who led us to the manor. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an enlrance room, a bathroom, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with a spacious and anxious closet. They were decorated in simplicity clll: green waI1s, marbled tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play the bronebs by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Br0nze Venvs in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furnitvro. In the ball stood a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had a large mattress lying on the bed floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the corn bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed cl rockcess marble, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in cl large sailor's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not lhink oursolves just licked in the oxaminant contained. On the tablet of Tbe, the ruins of the Empires of Voltajre, Shokspeare, Boileau and Rovsseau are finished; the ruins of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schillor of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels of the Greek press in Canstantinople, torn ruch, but no English book 0f no description. Most of these books were filled with margial notes, written with a pencil, in Italian clnd Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sllps af paper, on wbich were also remarks.\nThe old McLn said: \"The Lord had read these books the eternal grace he was navigating, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must go to his return; if he is his parliculclr, that is, I would move a thing without ordors, he would frown me for a week t0gether; he is very good othorways. I once had him a fervour; and I hated the practicum of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who dwells in a sinall hut in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianop1e; I know why.\"\nThe appearance af tho external house1y was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty paces lang and fourteeri brocld, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work corniccs (as jt is now usual in Greek architecture,) were curiderably higher than the reds. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine Tvrkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen strong. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings in smokirig, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the breeze tho cvenerig.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens mingled on the edges, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with on the ornamental back w ooden, on which we said, the lord passed many of his vespers and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and tcllking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of his seat was what can be called \"a bird-eye vlew.\" A line of rich vineyards with an eye on Mount Calcla, covered with oljve and myrtle trees iri b1oom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek lempet appeared in majestic decomposition. A smclll ftream from the ruins descended into brake cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. Tbe sea smootb like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single clovd, finishes the view in front; arid a little on the left, through a vista of high chestnuts and palm trees, several Sinall islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I had a more beautiful view than this one; but our research was unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solillude: no one knew his name, but Doininick, his banker, who had won in Candia. \"Tbe Armenian,\" said our leader, \"cou1dtell, but I'm sure he won't,\" – \"And you say it to the cannol, old friend?\" \"If I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we searched the details of the isolated Lord. He had shared the eyes of the young girls when he was last on the island and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave an eel to the man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the daughters who bound by wearing these articles. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor childron. In short, we appeared, from a1l that we collected, for having been a very eccentric and bony character. Orie circumnftance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate to reveal. He had a more beautiful davghter, with which one often saw the Iord walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him the Vse oss it himself.\nThese were the information with which we expelled from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imogine-\nI think it's his rambling in Greecc. Ho had money that he was uldent: he had philanthropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FDSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels a thc islond from Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been in our farm house for a few years; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every pige. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curiovs in our research at tbo cattage, bvt we have comforted ourselves the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not qvile uriinteresting, and in justice the good name of his seigneury, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive djsposition, an averso to associate with the brulonne nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as can be clearly gathcred from these IIttle anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his seigneury's poems, seem to have fallen seated in his hosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and to remove his rest from solitude is an additional reason to mark him as being clêtre on whose heart the Religion has put his sea1, and On whose head Benevolence cast her coat. No man has read the pleasant \"features\" of the precedrig without feeling proud of him as a covntryman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with water, in particular the wheri directed against the moral integrity of mcln; and the one who dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make a secret bonin, arid shun tbc world of applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart arid self-approval coriscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown-ourt, Fleet-Street.",
    "14": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on the whlch this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it is common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which timo, the increasingly widespread idea, beat a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it graduated and formed the subjecl of many wandering stories, existing stjll, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the thyg and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a few slight varatjori, al1 on Hvngary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims at night, which were emaciated, lost their strength, and rapidly diod of consumption; while the human blood suckers tbese grasd—and the veins of tir bccame distend the state of repletion such, as cause tbe blood to flow from all passages af their body, and even to fill the very pores of the skins of jr.\nIn the London Joumal, in March 1732, was a curious and, of course, credible among a particular case of vampyrism, which would have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems, that after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arno ld Paul, had been heard, that, cll Cassovicl, on the fronts of the Turkish Servia, had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a misfortune to get rid of the grieving, eating from the land of the vampy soin...\nE's grave, and rub with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from seizing a vampyrc himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people coincided with being tormented by him, and a deposition was mclde, that four hcld porsoris were deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid any error, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagnj, took the badger, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free fr0m corruption, and emltlng in the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and floridbload. Since Proaf was thus obtairiod, they rode to the Accuslomed remedy. A pole was completely led through Arriold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures as those adopted by thosososos who had previously died of vompyrisin, lest they become, iri their turri, agents over others who survived them.\nThe universal belljef is, that a porson sucked by a vampyre itself becomes a vampyre, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other lnstarice that might be presented. In some parts of Greece, this is a kind of punishment after the dcath, for the odious somo criminal committed while in the oxistence, trot tbe deceased is not only brought to vampyrise, but has pushed to limit his infernal victuations only to those beings whom he loved the highest of the earth — those t0 that he was bound by tics of kinship and affection. — A supposition mentioned in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corfe shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place, and sucking the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wjfe, Atmidnight draineth the stream of life; yet take away the banqvet that perseveres Mvs feed your livid, living corfe, your victims, are tbey yel, will know the devil for their sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, thy slows wilt on the stem. But he who, because of your crime, is to be kindled, the greatest beloved of all, will bless you in the spirit of the name of a father: This word shall engulf your earpiece in flame. Yet you have a task to do and you have marked the last tink of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and his last glazed look must see Whicb freezcs o'er his blue lifters; then, with a non-haled hand, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a wick of the thorn of Asfection has been worn, but now is carried by the Memorial of Thyagonia! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy tooth of gnachirig, and thy lip of thug; then, hunting toward thy sulten tomb, Go-arid witb GouIs and Afrits rave, until these things in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey bas olso presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", thc vampyre c0rsse of the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having resumed the grave in order to torment him, loved wbilst better in exile. But this cannot be supposed to make the sinner of her life resouler fr0m, sbe bei ng made the whole story as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long story in his lraves of several ast0nishing cases of vampyrism, to which he preterizes to be an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on it was, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, traditional arid narratives illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nOne could add a lot of curious and interesting things on this superstition, which is very horrific; although the present self suffices for the limils of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and wbich rnoy riow bc conclvd by merely pointing out, that if the term Vampyre is that in rnosl general acceptance, there are several other synoryms with it, the madc use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happens that in the mjdsl of the dissuatians accompanying on a London writer, the different parties of the leaders of the ton appeared a noblemary, more remarkable for the singularities hjs, than the row bis. He looked at the gliding around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only its attraction, it could by a laak qvell, and the fear of blowing in those breosts whero thindlcssness reigned. Those who felt this sense of duty, could not explain from where this itarose: orne attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sitting on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce thr-\nBut he fell on the cheek of a ray of bow that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to go to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had assailed themselves to the violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were begged to have something in their preponderance that engaged the attention of Tbejr. In spite of the deadly horror of her fae, wbich nevcr got a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong bone emotion Possjon, her shape and exterior1 were beautiful,1 many female hunters after notoriety aspired to gain her attention, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been moc ery to every m0nsler dressed in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and threw himself everything except on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention:—although in vain:—when sho slood before him, although his eyes had apparently flopped on that of her, it seemed that they had not seen each other;—even her unhopeful impudence was strewn, and she left the fjeid. Although adultery does not even influence the direction of his eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the vile woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to h imsel to the semal. He had, however, the reputatiori af a winni ng torigue; and although it was even that he overcarnated the horrific character af hls chantvlar, or that they werc moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was also often among the thososo semals who formed the boast of their sex fred the domestic virtues, as well as among those who shovel him by their vices.\nPart of the same shot, he came to London a young gentleman named Aub Rey: he was an orphan left with cln only sisler iri the possession of great wealth, by the parents who diod while he was still in childhood. For fear that he would attack himself by guards, who thought that it was only about taking care of his fortune, that they would abandon the most important burden of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high romantic feeling of honor arid candour, whipping every day ruins so many learnings of miIljners. He was all to sympathize with the spiritual virtue, and thought that thal uice was thrown into Providence simply for the picturesque efsect of the scene, as we see in the aromas: he thought that thal the misery of a more house consists of jri the garment of canvases, which were warm af, but which were better adapted to the eyec of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He toovghl, in the end, the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was dreadful, frank and rich: for Tbeese reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded the bims, obstructing things that had to describe with the least noise their languishing or grumpy favourites: the naughty at the same time, by their enigmatic countenancics as he approached, and the gleaming eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance os hif of solitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the tailaw and the flanked wax candles, not of the preseneo of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of photos and fold descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation in graceful bis vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we have above descri6od, went through him in his career.\nHc dumped him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in the bimsclf, who gave few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis jmagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he formed this object lnto the hero of a romance, set in motion to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather tbari the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has advanced in his opinion, that his presence has been recagnezed. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the preparation notes iri — Slreet, realized that he was about to travel. Desiring to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, had only brandish his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for hjrn to tour, which for many generations was considered necessary to unable the young lo to take a few quick steps in the care of vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous iritrigucs are lied as subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented; and Aubrey unequivocally evoking his intellects to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of bim, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he welcomed him with joy, and in a few days they had passed to oircling waters.\nSo far, Aubroy had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now to be far away, that, although many of his acions had been exposed to his point of view, the results would oscillate from the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from the hand of bis more than cn0ugh to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not notice, that it is not about the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he gave his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely removed; bul wheri the profligatecame to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to crush himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, has been attributed to greater importunity, if the vicious, which usually prevails over the repugnant carelessness of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance obsessed with the charity of her Lordship, which was even more permeated on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all eithcr leading t0 the scaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities where the pafscd was located, Aubrey was surprizcd to the spirit with which his campanion sought the centres of all the fisbiable vices; there he entered into the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except when the known hunter was bis clnt-clgonist, then he lost even more thclri than he won; but it was alwclys with the immutable fame fac, with which he gazed the society around: it was not, however, when he met the young Novlce eruption, or the chancellor father of a large family; then his very desire seemed weak forturia — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than the cat's lhat while dilating with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left his youth formerly deafened, torn from the circle, blushing, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn bim wilhiri the reacb of this fiend; while mony a big frenetic sat, amjdft the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his immense wealtb fire, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he had no money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, he had iust snacked from the corrosive take of the innocent: this could but bc the result of a degree of certainty of knowledge, which was rioting, however, able to fight tho ounning of more experienced tho. Aubrey wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from charity and plea that proved the ruin of all, and did not have his own profit;—bvt he dclayed-for every day he bopod his friend givots him an opportunity to harvest frankly and openly to hiin; commentevcr, he never happened. Lord Ruthven iri, his car, and the wild and rich scenes of nature, were always the same: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and lhough Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no gratification more groat of him than the consternation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exaltation began to assume the appearance of the same supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey foresaw the time 1st seen from his oompanion; he left him in the daily clendency on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memorials of the almost naked anothor cjty. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only the affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had been besieged in his irnaginatjon only there a bad pagan residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufscient reasons for belief. His guards insisted that he inevitably left his friend, clrid vrged, that the bis character was terribly uici0us, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to silk. He had been disdained, that his consecration for the odultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, partner of his guilt, scrambled the pinccle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, that all the snails which ho had sought, apparently because of their uirtue, hod, Sirice his departure, even threw the mask, and had not relieved to expose all the deformation of their vices in the eyes of the publication.\nAubrey determined up to 0n 1aiving oria, whose oharacter had not yet shown a single point of brigbt on wbich to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning altogcther hjm, seeking, in the middle whjle, to monitor him more closely, and to leave rio slight circumstances possess by urinoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordshjp was madness to work on the experience iri dudaughler 0f lcldy whose house ho chie-\nFlight frequented. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to meet in society; he is therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon realized that an assignment had been signed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent woman, a long thought. Not wasting time, he entered L0rd Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her al thc time of glory to be aware of her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had an opportunity on svch; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, was content with laughing. Aubrey rctired; and, immediately writing a note, t0 say, that frorn this moment must be declino accornpaning his Lordship in the remower of their visit project, he ordered his fervent to look for other apartments, and on the rother af the lady, inform her of all that he knew, n0t only with regard to the hor girl, but cllso concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to notify his eopplete consent to a separation; but did not invoke a svspician of his plans having been thwarted by the interpasion of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey dirocized his steps towards Greece, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found his sons at Athe ns. He then fixed his residence in the bosom of a Groek; and soon took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of the aricient glory on the lhclt clpporently monuments, scathed by the ohronic1 of the deods of free men on the slaves beforo, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the roof of fame as hese1f, there existed a bein g, so beautiful and delicate, that she could havc formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of hayfvl into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke t0o Muchmind for anyone to thirik she could belong to those who had no souls. As she put on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for who could have exchanged his yeah, apparently the eyec of the animated naturc, for this luxurious look asleep of the appropriate onimale but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ionthe often accompanied Auhrey in his sea after antjquites, and often the clumsy girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her forrn, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on a nearly erased tablet, in the ointment of her figure of sylph. Ofton wanted his fcllling braids, as she flattered around,exhl6it in the ray of the sun so brilliantly shining and fwlftly discoloring the shades, he simmered well the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escape his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital importance for the proper interpretation of the passage of cl in Pausanias. But why try to be charms that everything feels, but laughs can enjoy?—It was innocent, young and brittle, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and amazement balls. As Ho drew these bone remains that hc wanted to keep a memorial for her future hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical flaws of her pencll, plotting the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe to her the circular dance on the open plain, matched, to him in the flamboyant olores of youthful memory, the rnarriago p0mp that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning to suhjects that had obviously made an impressionniori Greeklter on her mind, told her all the supernatural lales of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent helief of what she was telling, aroused Aubrey's interest; and often as she had told him that the living vompyre, wbo had spent years in the midst of bjs friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, based on the life of a fomola the prolonged existence during the following months, his blood would be ruri oold, while he had rushed to laugh at such an idle and horrible fatase; but Ianthe quoted to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among tbemselvos, af ter many of their close relatives and children had found bcen marked wlth the stamp of the appetite of the fiend; and wben she flooded him so incredulous, shc begged 0f hiin to believe it, for he had pointed out, that these who had dared to seek their existence, and had always had proof, which forced them to confess and to break his heart. She stripped him of the traditional applause of these monsters, and the horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord Ruthucn; he, who, still hesitated to persuade her, that there could be no truth in his fears, although at the same time he erred in the many cojncences that had all tended to excite a jn tho supernatvral belief power of Lord Rulhveri.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianlhe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the emotional virtues of the women among whom he had sought the vision of romance, gained his heart; and wbile he ridiculed the idca of a young man af English hahits, biting a Greek girl without education, still found himself m0re and more attached to the almost magical form before hlm. He sometimes ripped it off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he could go away, dissuaded not to return until his object was reached; but he still found impossible six of his attitudes on the ruins surrounding him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianlhe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate from him with reticence; bul it was because she did not have to lorige a single wilh wham she could visit her favorite haunts, that her guardian was 0ccvpied in the drawing or uncovcringsame fragment that had escaped the destructive hclnd of tjme. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of Vampyres, and they botb, with several present, affirmed their existence, the pale horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they shouted the name of the place, they all both begged not to come back at night, for he had to go through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the uampyres in their night orgies, and bare the most boavy ailments as impondering on the one who dared to cross the thoir path. Aubrey made the light of lhejr representatlons, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superjor, an infornal power, whose very name apparently frcezed his thorium blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey ended his excurfion; he was surprised to observe the molclncholy face of his host, and felt puzzled to find that the words hjs, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, bad jnspired tbem with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and sincerely begged HLM to crash, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the day limb would end saori, arid that on the horizon there was one of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country.—He finally groaned, mounted bis borse, determined to move by the speed for the delay hjs: but he was looo 1ate. Twice, in these southern climates, the almosl unknawn; immodiately, the sun sets, the neighborhood begins: are arid he had aduanced far away, the power of the storm was engaged — his horny thunders hardly had a rest interval — his thick heavy groove forced his way near the cariopying falsification, while the forked blue ligbting seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the eritangled forest. The animal finally, because of fatigue, stopped, and it f0und, by the glare of lightning, that it was iri tbe district af a havel that hard1y lifted upwards of the masses of dead leaves and bruine bruce surrounded it. Demonstrating, he learned, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to the East trustirig to get a shelter from the bone pool the st0rm. As he approached, the tbunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who was making a mockery, exulting, of a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound; — he was set on his way; but, awakened by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with an effort svdden, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in the darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, for although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found himself in a contaet with an oria which he immediately grasped; when a voice shouted, \"Always scorned!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by an oria whose strength seemed superhuman: dctcrmined to sell his Iife as dearly as he could, he strangled; bul It was in vain: he had been lifted up from his way and cast with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy fell upon him, and kneeled upwards of his breclsl, had placed his haries vpon his throat—whcn the dazzling of many torches penetrating through the hole of thal given 1ight in the day, the trouble; — he rose up unfathomably, and, bis leclante prey, precipitated both the door, and in a moment the crashjng of the branches, as hc broke through the wood, was no longer the beard. The st0rm was now sti1l; and Aubrey, unable to move, was heard by those who heard it. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the straw charged on each straw with heavy flakes of s0ot. In search of Aubrey Tbey who had attracted him to his series, he was again in the darkness; but who was her husband, when the light of the trachees burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful coriductress brought in a corse of lifelcss. He closed his eyes, bopjng thal it was bvt cl vislon coming from his troubled imagination; 6 but he ogain saw the same forrn, when he dispossessed them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, even on his lip; yct there was a dizziness about his caress that seemed almost as tame as the baby life that once lived there: — on his rieckarid br est was blood, and on his throal were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this the merited, weeping, simultaneauxly struck the spiritual horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her, who had recently raised the 0bjecl from so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the engine of life that had died in it. He did not know what the thoughts of bis were – his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflection, the clnd took refuge in the vacancy – he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had boon found iri the hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her which an inother had infused. Their lamentations61 weep, as they approached the city, warning the parents of a disaster of drcadsul. \"From scrojbe their mourning would be jimposible; bul when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was drunk with the most vlotent felt, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would have called up to 0n L0rd Ruthven clung to Ianthe – by imprescriptible somc corn that he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare being he loved. At the time, he cursed the curses on his head, and cursed the hjm as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, lucky this time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, in heclring in the state of Au6rey, immediately placed his sons in the same house, and became his constant assistant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he trembled and was surprised by the blow of the one whose image was now combined with the tbat of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their solation, and even more by the attention, anxiety and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite ochanged; he appeared more than the apalhetic beirig who had so surprised Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence bogon to be ra pid, ho gradually withdrew into the slclte sclme of the mind, and Aubroy did not perceive any differentene frorn tbe former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on bim, with a smile of malicious exvulsion playing on his lips: he did not know why, bvt thjs smile hunned him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in the watchjrig the tideless waves raised by the coaling breeze, or by marking the progress of these orbs, circumspecting, like our world, the motion1ess sun;—in fact, he seemed to wish t0 to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weakened, and the thal elasticity of fpirit wbioh once had a distinguished hirn now seemed slod forever. He was now as in love with the solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for salvation, his mirid would not find him in the vicinity of Atbens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, the shape of Iarithc stood by – if he were looking for him in the wo0ds, his slight step was drawn wondering in the middle of the underwo0d babe, in search of the modest purple; then southdcn1y turning, would show, to his wild imagination, his wounded throat face clnd pee, with a sweet smile on his 1lps. He decided to steal scenes, each element of whlch created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthugri that he himself take care of himself during his illness, in order to visit these regions of Greece and not yet go there. They walked in all directions, and looked for a place where a memory could be attached; but, although they had taken possession of it from one place to another, they did not seem to take account of the war they were watching. They heard many robbers, bul they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom lhey defended fr0m claimed to be dangcrs. Because of this neglect of local counsel, they occasionally traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. At the entrance...\nOn the other hand, a limited number of enterprises\nAt the botlom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks 6roughl down from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were started by the whistling of the clove bullets to their hoads, and by the echo of the relation of the evocative gvns. In an instant, the guard body had left lhem, and by placing the babind rocks of euxselvef, had begun to pull the oame ratio towards iri lbe wheele. Aubrey, Lord Ruthven, retired for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement; but shameful, thus held by an enemy, who shouted at them with hearing, and being exposed to unrelenting slaughter, is ari of the robbers shovld climb over and take them to the rear, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey sat down to help him; and, no longer than there was danger, he was soon surprised by the fact that his guards began to scream at Lord Ruthven's wounds, tossed his arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them out of his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, hc was n0 more dislocated by their possessor – they simply kept the entrance until the comrade tbeir returned with the sum pramized, for whatb he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days mortlficatlon followed, and death broke a path with hasty stpps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; it seemed that the pain was as unconscious as it had been of the objects surrounding him; but towards the end of the lasl ov ening, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with more seriousness than usual—\"Assjst me! You can save me – you do more than that – I do not mean my life, I have listened to the teeth of my existence as thin as the one of the passing day; but you can savre my honaur, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little, of my opacity of life, I cannot expiajri everything — 6 but if you imagine everything you know about me, my horror was free to stain in man's mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — me— but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence: \"Swear by your soul, by all your fears, swear that, a year and a day, you do not import your kn0wledge of my crimes to any living being in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or what you can see. \"He saw his eyes burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he slept laughing on the pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey withdrew from the resl, but did not stop; the many circumstances that were present at his arrogance with this man arose upon his spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill fell upon him, as if he were in the present of something terrible awaiting him. He got up early in the morning, and he took over the stirrup in which ho had left the corpse, when a rober met him, enlisted. he was no longer there, having been passed on by himself and his comrades, at the time when he withdrew, at the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, heading towards a prom, they had given his seigneury, that he should be exposed 6th to the first ray of the lhat moon rose after his death. Auhrey aftonished, and took several of the men, determined togo and buried him on the place where he was lying. But when the hc rose to the top, he found no 0f troce or body or clathes, although the thieves swore that they had reported the identical rock or that they had laid the body. For some time, the bis spirit was relegated to conjugations, he finally came back, convinced that they had yelled at the body for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for hejghten that melancholic superslitif who had grasped on his mind, to be res0lved to leave him, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to go to Otranto or Naples, he took care of the organization of these effects which he had with him belonging to LordRuthven. Among the others, there was one case where there were several weapons af affencc, mare or less obpted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinning a shcoth apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain more evidence, he found the wcapon, on his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, although particularly shaped, the fheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to have no need for such certainty, they would be gasirig to be bound to the dagger, but he still wanted to distract himself; but the particular shape, the same different shades vpon the haft and the sheath were similar in splend0ur on b0th, and left no place to doubt; there were drops of blood alsa on eclch.\nHe left Smyrna and, on his return to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had tried to snatch the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she has not been heard since the departure of her lordsbip. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under the repeated horrors of mary; it was afrajd that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He stood up and was silent; and his only ccupatiori pusist in exhorting the spied bones the poftilions, as if he were going to save you the lily of whatever ane he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, wbich sown, obcdinated at his will, soon tucked him on the English shores; and he hastened to his fathers' house, and lerc, for a mummerite, appeared tolose, in the einbraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her asfectlon, now that the womari was beginning to appear, she was flill inore attachecs a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have tal winning thanks to whieh wins the look and applause of drawing-r0om assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exaggerates only in the rough atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eyes never light up by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was o melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to arise from the malfortvne, but from the sensation of home inside, which appeared for indlcate a s0ul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not light f0oting, which goes astray where to a butterf1y or a coIour can attract – it was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, his fclce was brilliant by the smile of joy; but when his brother shone at his hls affeeti0n, and would be jn his presence to Forggt those deuils that she knew destroyed his rest, who would have excavated his smile for this volupluary oss lhe? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still eighteen years old, and she had not been introduced to the world, she was Tugt by her guardians more in shape than her preconception should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, would be the opode of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey prefers to stay in the home of his fathers, arid feeds on the melancholy that orders him. He could not feel interested in the friuolities of the fashjoriable strangers, when his mind had been so hot by the students he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to his sister's protectoriori. Thoy soan arrived in town, and prepared for him the next day, which was badly announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a bad living room did not hold long, and all those who were impatient with bosk in the kingly smile, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. Wbile ho wcls standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account everything around him, engaged iri thc to remember that the time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he suddenly fessed himself by the arm, and a voice he rebuked too well, smiled at his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had a hard caurage to turn, afraidfu1 to see a spectrum that blasthim, when he pierces, a little distance away, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered into sooity. He looked until his limbs were almost refusing to carry the weight of the Ir, hc was forced to take a friend's clrm, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was drlven home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of the bis brain. Lord Ruthven agairi preceded him — the circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He awakened hlmse1f, he could not believe it — the dead resurrection again! — He slipped his imagination had swore vp the imagc his mind was rested on. It was impossible for him to be real — so he soaked up going back to society; for although he tried to dare about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. By allowing his urider the protection of a matron, he withdrew to a corner, and there he went to his own devoring affairs. Perceiving that many were leaving, he woke up and entered Anolher's room, found his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a bitter conuersotion; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one, whom he had asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these excrements that he was most abhorrent. And he took his sister's arm, and hastily forced her to the street; and at the gate he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were striving for their lords; and while he was engaged to Jri, he passed them by, and heard the voice whispering at the top, saying, \"Remember your oath!\"\nAubrey became very distracted. If before the mind of hjs was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's liulng has again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her who had caused her abruper. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more unbeliever he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to lower this monster to wander, carrying ruin vpon bis breath, amjdst all that he has defiled dearly, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been naked by him. But even if he broke his oath, arid disc1ose bis svspiciorif, who would believe it? He bought his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he remembered, had already mocked beeri. For days he remained in the state of Thjs; locked in his room, no one was seen, and no one ate until his sister came, only with eyes floating in tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Lost, unable to endure silence and loneliness, helest his house, wandered from street to str-\nand, desiring to steal this image that flouted him. His dress bewitched, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humidity of the night. He was not ten years old to be recognized; he first returned home, and at last he laid him to rest where fatigue was weak. His sister, clnxjous for his safety, employed people to follow bim; hut they were soon distanced by bim who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought — srom. However, Hif's conduct has suddenly changed. Sluck with the idea that he left by the absence of all his friends, wlth a fiend ainongst babe, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to look closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered the room, his hamburger and his distrustful Iooks were so stubborn, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was lagging behind in begging him to refrain from stalling, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the gvardians thought it was good to intervene, and fearing that his mjnd would be alienated, they thought it was high time to take up this lrust that had previously been imposed on the in by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the irijurjes and from the sufferings that he had daily received in his wandorings, and to prevent him from expatriating to the generolic eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, tbey hired a doctor to reside in the house, ond take conlarit carc of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, because he had completely the mind absorbed by ono terrible suhjeot. His incoherence was finally so great that he was confined to his room. There, he would lie for days sadder, unhappy to be awake. He had become macaceous, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and respiration appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he desired that she should not touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, come near to him!\" Wheri, however, she asked wbom to be referred, her only answer was, \"True! True!\" He rang again in a slate, from which he was never able to wake him. It took a lot of months: however, little by little, as the year passed, its less frequent bocame inconsistencies, and his mind threw away some of his morosity, which was his guardian 0served, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his tutors entering the room, began to converse with his doctor about the melanholy circumstance of being Aubrey in a situation so awfvl one, when his fisher went the next day to get married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was drawn; he anxiously asked wham. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, of which they feared that hc had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom hc had met in society, Avbrey Seemod pleased, and surprised them even more by his bis intention to express hc present at the nuptiaIs, and dcsiring lo to see his sister. Tbey didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sistcr was with him. Hc was apparently again able to beirig affected by the jnfluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears of wet mind, slowing down to the thought of his brothel to be once morc alivo ta the tributaries of the affluent. Hc began to speak wilh all his won warmth, and to congratulate his marriage vpon ber with a person his distinguished for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on the ber chest; the opening, what was his surprise al b holding the characteristics af the mo nster who had so lorig influenced life. He took the p0trtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and took it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her futurc husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grab his bandf, and look at her with a frantic expression of face, swearing that she would not want to marry this inonster, for he—but he could not advariate—it seemed that if lbat voice had again made him repeat his oath—he turned Sudderly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen wcls riear hlm bul did not see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard Tbe whole, and bought that it was only a return of her disorder, cntered, and the forcing Mifs Au6rey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, he became irritated, he begged to wait one day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, drenched to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had anointed the Mornjng after the dredging room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard Aubrey's ill health, he readily realized that hlmsels were the cause of this disease; but the one he learned was considered an insanity, his exultation and pleasure could be hard to correlate with those among whom ho had slipped this information. He welcomed your h0use from his former companion, and, through constant attendance, and the pretension of affection for the br0ther ond interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could spoak of himself as an induidual h not have sympathy with any guidance on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed if;—could say how, as he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preselection, if it were joyfully that ho nright lislen to his soothing occents;—finally, know so well how the use of the serpent's art, 0r such was the will of destiny, tbat he gained his affections. The title of the older branch fell to its length t0, he obtained a large embassy, which announced itself as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed slate of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAvbrey, when left by the physieran and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, the corijurjng, as she appreciated her own happiness, bor own honovr, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hope and hope of their dung, to delay but for a few hours the marriage lbat, on which to be denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that jt bet so as not to harass Miss Aubrey hy any more, what he orisi dared, tobe ravings of a cassava. The night passed on wilh0ut rest to the occupied prisoners of the house thc; arid Aubrey heard, with a horror that me more easily be eunced than doscribod, the notes of the Hussy prepclration. The morning came, and the wagon sound broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cu riosjty of the servants of Tbe eventually surpassed the vjgjlance, they gradually stole the grip, leaving it in the vice of an old woman powerless. He seized the op0rtunity, with a bourid coming out of the room, and, in an inoment, he found himself in the opartment where the entrapment was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, waved, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, speechless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven bowed in his ear: \"Remember your 0ath, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came ill into the sea from him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage did not find ventilation, a bad break of a b1ood-vessel1, and ho was transmitted lo bed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbyslcian was afraid to shake him. Tbe's marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bride left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be hasty, arid when midnight had struck, to tell of the corn that hit the roder, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; bumblebee when they arrived, it was too lclte. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped AVAMPYRE's thirst!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The wasal world1 before hirn, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIn the Greek Archipelago, on one of Majcsty's ships, iri in the year 812 we put in the port of Mit-\nYlene, on the island of this namo. The beauty of this place, and a certain supply of arid vegetables of cattle still t0 there, lead many British ships to visit jt—warmen and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, it is Bountjesamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and that the men were carrying water, and that the bag for the cattle wilh tbc ncltive, the ecclesiastical, and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's Scbool, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound so named) we met and engagcda young Greek as our gujde, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am Iikely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English eurreney,) and resided the threshing about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the difference is the Iands.\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose lime in haste at the time our peasant had recovered. We were kindly received by an old man who was running uf over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious clot attached. They were simply al1 d ecoré : light green walls, marble tabl ef on either side, myrtle of lorge in the center, and smalI suntain below, whieh could be made for p1ay through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Vonus in a hole of leclriing; a large sofa or fofa o0 fills the fur. In the hall there were half a dozen EngIish cane chairs, and a bo0k-case vacuum: there were no rnirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom Tbe had only one spread mattress, with two cotton mattresses and a pillow, the oommon bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books of clnd papers, who were then in the chest of a great sailor in the boot: it was open, but we did not think that ourself justified to examine the content. On the reoess tablet, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimrnerman, in the Germari language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebuc; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Ilalian edition, printed in Parma in l810; several small pamphlels of the Greek press in Constantinop1e, very torn, but no English book of any description. Most lhesis books were accompanied by marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ita1ian and Latln. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man exclaimed: \"The lord had read these boat-tbe evening, so he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they must lie to his rctum; for he is so porticular, that if I went to the thing with the orders of Oul, he would frown inside for a week; he is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; arid I have the product of his farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an oge Armenian who rcsides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of outdoor use was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty paoes long and fourteen wide, and the pillars in marble fluted with black and fri-\nThe comics (as is the case today in Greekjan's arochemistry) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof of Tbe, surmounted by a stone balustro of li ght, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surpassed, as on them the Greeks pass their evcnings by smoking, drinking wines of 1ight, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, clnd erjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and ljmes gathered together on its borders, and under the shade of large bushes of myrtle, a seat of marhle with an outnameritaIwooden back was placed, on which we are told, the 1rd passed many of his evenings and nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed because he was fervent devotees, and that he always kept our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a view of 6ird\". A line of rich vineyards drew attention to Mount CaIcla, c0vered olive and myrt1e trees in bloom, and to the top of a tbe whose ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, and a horizon overflowing with a single eloud, finishes the sight in front; and a litt1e a left tip, thrugb a vista of high cbesnul and palm trees, the febrile srall islands were distinctly observed, spreading tho light blue waue with spots of emerald greeri. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were fruitful on the name of the pers0n who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who went to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could he,\" hut, \"I'm sure he won't,\" \"and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but in our retvrn to the city we learned severa1 from the secluded lord's parliculars. He had porped eight young girls when ho was last on the island, and cven daric with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the thigirls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he was often given Greek Testaments to poor children. In the shorl, he appeared to us, of all that we chose, as a very eccentric and benevolent character. An ooztance that we lick, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to decipher. He had a beautiful rnoste daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and taught him bimself the usc of this one.\nSuch as wos the information with which we left MityIene's poaceful ifle; our imagination all about the rclck, guessing who tbis crawling into Greeco could be. He found money that he was euded: to be bad philanthropy of disposiliion, and all these eccentricities wbich inark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupll 0f WYATT'S, wbo had boen traveling to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tcnedos, and I also visited him in Mlty1ene\". We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been so many years from home; but \"Childe Haro1de\" being put jnl0 our hands wo recognized the recluse of C olcla iri every page. We deeply regretted that we had not been curious in our research at the eoltoge, but we comforted the ovrs Ives with the idol to return to Milyle some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I take this statement, believing that he laughs without any interest, and in court in the good name of bis seigneuria, whoh hos has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleosures. The foc is directly inverse, as can be clearly obtained from these anecdotes of ljttle. Al1 the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have the most seat in his b0som. The tenderness, sympathy and charity appear all his actions; and his awakening to the rest of solitude is an additional reasori to mark him as a being on whose heart the Religion has put his sole, and ovor whose head Beneuolence has lhrownher maritle. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral lawlessness of man; and the one who dares to justify it realizes that the horrible court where I have to appear, only can censor the errors of a sellow-m0rta1. Lord Byron's character is worthy of bis gcnius. Making progress in dryness, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "15": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Johri Wiliiam Polidori\nTHE superstition on wbich this tale is found is very gcneral in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend, hawen, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not assume its sorm preserit since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea is comjng dominant, tbat a Latin body could riot corrvpt if 6ur ied on their territory, it gradually increased, and sow subject to many wonderful stories, still existing, of tbe dcad rising from the tombs of toir, and sow on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, which led to the existence of the belief that the vampyres were soaking up some of the food of their victims, that the wbo was beautifying itself, losing their strength and dying suddenly of consumption; while these human boars were fattening — and that their veins were becoming distended to cause a state of replication, to cause the burden of all passages of their body to sink, and even to curl the pores of the thoir skiris.\nIn London Joumal, March I73z, is a curious, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which would have occurred in Madreyga, Hung-\nYes. It seems, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the Place de Tbe, that they unanimously affjrmed, that, about five years earlier, a ccrlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the srontiers of the Servia Turkisb, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to ridicule himself of evil, eating part of the land of the tomb of Lhe Vompyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. However, this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and bvrial, many people complained of being burned by him, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants who consulted Ir Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrlsm) fresh, and entirely free of corrupt Jon, and emitting inuth, riose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where it is reported that you shouted so terribly as if he had been alive. Tbis did, cut his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopted with the corses of these people who had died of vampyrism before, unless they were, in turn, como agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked 6y o vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief Hail.\nThis rodomonlade monfrouf is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other forum that might be presented. In many parts of Greece jt is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed wbilst in exiftence, thal thc deceased is not a blindly vampyrise door, but forced to limit his infernal visltations only to those whom he loved rnost while at the top of the earth — those to whom was bound by ties of kinship and affection. — An olute supposition to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut the fir trees of the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy horn is torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of the natius, Arid sucks the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; and eats the banquet that shall feed thy living livjd, Tby victirns, are still exhaled, They will beat the devil for their sire; As thou mockest thee, thou shalt irrit them, Thy flowers wilt fall upon the stem. But it is for your crime that he falls, the youngest, the best 6eloved of al1, Shclll blesses you with a name of father—Thot word shclil wraps your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last cloth of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see Who freezes or his lifeless blue; Thon with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the thorn is the most heaviest worn—But now has been born away from you Memoricll of your agony! But with the tbine itself 6laod shall flow; thy grinting tooth, and the lip of sack; then hunting at tby sullen falls, Go — and with the Govls and the Afrits rave, until lhese in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tha1aba\", the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. Bul this cannot be supposed to have resulted from lbe pessvlness of her life, she enjng has poured out throughout history as a type of competition of purity ond innocerioe. The true Tourriefort gives an account in its lravs of several amazing cases of vclrnpyrism, to whom it is claimed to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forward the fome savantod disserttotlons, tending to prove jt to 6th a classic, bone as well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting nolies about its singularly horrible superstition could be added; the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuolcd to the explanation, and which can now be concluded hy inerly remark, that tbough the term Vampyre is that in most general meanings, the re are several otbers synonym wlth it, makes use of in uarjovs parts of the world of lbe: cls Vroucolocha, Vardaulachcl, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied on a London wlnter, various parts of the bones appeared the leaders bone the ton a nohleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the luxurious laughter of the liver only attracts his attention, so that he can by a look qvell, arid throw fear into those breasts where the unbelievers reigned. Those who felt this frenzy of fear could not explain from where it lay: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixed on the face of the object, did not seem to peder, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the artery; but fell on tbe oheek wlth a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities prevented him from being invited to all houses; I wanted to see the hive, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were bent to have something in their presence capable of attracting their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, the shape and the ovtline were beautiful simul, many female hunters after the notoriety tried to win her attentiontioris, and to win, at least, some mclrks of what they call affection: Lady Mereer, who has been the trick of every monster in the drawing rooms since her marriage, thrown herfelf into her way, and did everything but pul or rdsf of a montebonk, to attract the attention of the people:—in vain:—when she stood 6eforo him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on the ber, stjll it seemed that they were not understood;—even her incomprehensible impudence was strehensive, and she let go. But although the common adulterer could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent spirit of calion that was spoken to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, tal nowknew that he attached himself to the women. However, he had the reputation of a long victory; and if it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vlce, ho was like howteri among the thofe women who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic vjrtues, bones among those who su1ly su1ly by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphan left with a sister of 0nly in possession of a great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to him also by the guards, who dictated him simply to take care of the lake of his fortune, while they abandoned the greater burden of the bis spirit to the attention of the subaltem mercenaries, hc cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. So he had this romantic feeling of arid honor, which every day ruines so many apprentices of thousands. He believed in sympathy for virtue, and thought that the uico was thrown into 6y Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see it in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply corisist in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irritating folds and various colorful patchefs. He thought, in the end, that dreams were the realities of life. Hc was haridsorne, frank, and ricb: for tbese reos0ns, at his entrance into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth tbeir languishing or farfelu favorite: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, arid by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon brought him to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the rannance of his hours of solilar, it was begun to find that, except in the tallow and the cracked wax candles, not fred the presence of a ghast, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no findatiori in the real life for any of these plea congreries--\nThe cinematographic descriptions contained these volumes, from which he had formed his study. On the other hand, because of a somc compensation in uanjty gratified bis, he was six to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we have over thecrlbed, crossed him in his care.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of f0rmirig an idecl of tbe character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, wbo gavo few other sigrits of his external observatiori objects, that the tacjt accord to their existence, implicit by evitaric tbe of their contact: allowing his irogination to pick up every thal thing flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as hero of a novel, and distracted from observing the offspririg of bis sancy, rather than the person before him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He learned gracefully that Lord Ruthveri's business was embarrassed, and soon he realized that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this cbaracter fingulclr, who, until now, had only captured his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was late for him to execute the day, which, for many genres, was deemed necessary for young people to take a few quick steps in the edge of the vice towards putting lhemselves on an equality with the elderly, arid not to appear them as fallen from the skics, whenevor intrigues scandalous are mentioned as subjects of pleclanterie or prclise, in accordance with the degree of competence shown iri cclrryjng thcm sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his internions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to make a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a brand of esolem by HLM, which apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he gladly accelerated it, arid in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHthorto, Aubrey had had the opportunity to study Lord Rulhven's charaeter, and now he found, that, although much more of his actions were exposed to hls uiew, the results offered different conclusions of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundantly iri bis liberally; — idleness, the vagaboride, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes which accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted alms of bis; — they sent out the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he profligated Carno to ask for something, not to relieve his sighs, but to immerse him in his lust, or to sink him even more into his iniquity, he sent him with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to tho grcater imp0rtunjty of the vicious, whicb usually prevail over the hedge at the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those on the wh0m it was granted, unshakeably found thal there was a curse on her, for they were encumbered either led to scaffolded tbe, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprizoed by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the fadoriary vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always bet wilh success, except where the best known was hjs antagonjst, and then he lost cven more tbon than he won; but it was always with the healthy unohanging face, with which he generally looked at the arourid sciété: it was not, however, when he would encumber the young novice eruption, or the unlucky father of a riumous family; then his wisb seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction of the strewn mind, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the catwhilst delirting with the ha1f-decld mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that had attracted him to the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantl, in the midst of the loo ks speaking af mute bungry children, in the mind only one distant from his last immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the tabla gamhling; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the lheconvulsive take of the innocent: this could but be the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commented, capable of fighting the trick of themselves experienced. Aurey has often fought to represent this to a friend bis, and begged him to resign from this charity and plea which proved the ruin of the stumbling block, and did not stand in the way. — but he dislodged him — it is hoped that his friend will give him a little opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this rumour has occurred. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild scenes and rich bones, was always the same: his eye spoke of the levees that his lip was; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he dared not omit any great nor gratificclition of him but the tough excitement that vainly wanted to break this inystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the training of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his appearance; he left him in the daily joy on the morning circle of an Italian countess, who married in search of the anniversaries of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he exhaled with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had before buried in his imagination that there was a power of evil residing in his companion, they seemed to give him some reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately left his friend bis, rushed to say that his character was terribly viclaus, because the possession of an irresistible power of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulterous lhc had not been born of the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his vilt, shouId be precipitated from the pinacle bone unsold virtue, to the lowest abyss of the infamy ond degradati0ri: in flne, he had all the semalefs he had sought, apparently because of tbeir virtuo, hod, since his departure, cast aside the mask, and had no scruples to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey was detorting at the time of the departure of the eye, the one who had eharacter had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, purposlng, in the mecln then, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass any slight eircumslances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that if Lordship was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly frequented at home. In Italy, it is Seldoin that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was obliged to keep his plas secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that a donkey had been named beeri, which would probably end in the ruiri of an innocent, gypsy gir1. Losing rio time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked her hjs intentions with respite to the lady, informing her at some point that he was aware of his being on the point of the sweet one that night. Lord Ruthven clung to the fact that his interests were such as he thought he would have had on such an occasion; and after having been in a hurry if he intended to marry him, laughs inerly. Aubrey was rejoining himself; and, no doubt, he pointed out that from that moment on he refused to accompany his Lordship jn remclinder him of their extended visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and sticking to the mother of the lody, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. Tbe's assignment was over. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servanl to notify the B.S. of full consent to a separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been defiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey went to Greoce, and struck the peninsula, soon in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and quickly took care to trace the faded documents of ancient monuments glory upan who, apparently, ashamcd to chronicle the acts of free slaves or to assimilate the slaves, had said themselves under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as hiinself, there existed a beautiful and delicate being, f0 that sho inigbt formed the modcl for a painter wishing t0 fortray or canvases the hope promjsed of thc fajthful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too mirid so that someone might think that it might belong to those who did not evil. As she stood on the plateau, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for who could have excavated her eye, apparently to the eye of an anjmy nature, for this luxurious and stunned look of the animal committed suicide but had the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butler of Kashrnere, shaw all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, with the greedy look of hjm, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the oontempion of his figurative sylph. Often, her braids would fall, as she freaked out arovnd, would display in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, this might well excuse the oblivion of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had besieged of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the chclrms with all the feelings, but no one can appreciate it?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by the drawing rooms and the stinging 6alls. As he drew these remains which he poured out to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical erasings of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; sbe would then describe to her the dance circlrig on open tbe p1ain, w0uld paint, to him in all the brilliant colors of the young mother, the pomp of marriage that she queenrnbered watching in her childhood; and tben, tben, to subjects that had obviously mclde a greater impression upwards in her mind, would tell her all the supernatural tales 0f her laugh. Her sincerity and her apparent belief 0f what she was telling, extorted the iriterest even to Aubrey; and she often told bim the story of the living vampy, who had passed through yesors in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced every ycar, by slitting on the life of a 1ovaly fernale to prolong his existence for the months that followed, her blood ran co1d, while he tried to get her out of such idle and horrible fclntases; but Ianthe quoted to him the names of the old men, who had finally detected a living among the thomselves, after several of their close relatives and their children had been found dragged with the seal of the fiend's appetia; and when she found the back so incredulous, she begged him to sit down, so he had been, he had been, noticed, those who had dared to question their existence, had always had the proof, and bound to confess to him, to confess. She detailed to him the traditional craze of these monsters, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lard Rutbven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that tbereco would not be the truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the coinocences mary who had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey b egan to attach him more and more to Iantho; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virtues of the women that he had sought to see love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idec of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, stjll ho found sons more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form before hirn. At times he was tearing himself apart from her, and, forming a plan for a few antique dealers, he went away, decided not to return to the object reached; but he always had the impassable to focus his attention on the tricks around him, while in his mind he took up an image which seemed to be the sole owner of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and wcls always the same child frank being that he had first knawri. She has always seen your share of him reluctantly; but it was because she had no one left that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing 0r discovering a fragment that had still escaped the time-destructiue band. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed existence, pclle wlth horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to take one of his excursions, which prevented him from holding him for a few hours; they heard the name of the pl aee, all at once begged not to come back at night, for he had to go through a wo0d, where no Greek wovld would ever remain, after the day had closed, until any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of Vompyres in their nocturnal 0rgies, and denounced the heaviest ovilf as imminent on hlm who dared too much their palh. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them out of the idecl; but when he warmed them up to his audacity to mock a superior in this way,\nevil power, the very name of which, by chance, shaped their blood gel, it was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excrement; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find his words, mocking the belief of these horrible proud ones, irspired thom with such terror. When he was enlisted to leave, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and he became seriously angry with him, and at night left the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. It was, how ver, so busy in his reseorch, that he did not perceive that day-lighl was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spocks whieh, iri tho warmer climates, so quickly gathering in o huge mass, and pouring all their rage over the devoted land.—He at 1clst, however, m0ururized his horse, determined to catch up with your speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twiljght, in these climates of the south, is almost unknown; irnmediatley the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was the abovc — his echo thu ndors had barely a resting interval — The heavy rain forced his way through the oanopying foliage, while the light forked blue seen to fall and rcldiate to his vcry feeling. Suddenly, his hare was frightened, and he was carrioled with terrible rclpidity in the tangled forest. Finally, the animal stopped, throvgh fatlgue, and found, by the glare of a thal, that it was in the vicinity of a hoveI which hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little orient to guide bim to the city, at least confident to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a MingIirig woman with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost non-brokeri sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, by a sudden effort, forced the door of tho hul. Ho found himself bimbo in whole darknoss: sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not...\nBecause he called, he continued the sounds, and he didn't notice about him. He sneaked into contact with someone he seized immediately; when a voice exclaimed, \"Agclin ba waffled!\" He felt in vain raised from his feet and threw huge blows of whips against the ground: his enemy threw himself at him, and knelt his chest, he threw himself on his throat; when the brightness of the torches of penelrat mary crossed the hole of daylight, he disturbed him; he rose instantly, and let his prey rush through the door, and in an instant the jamming of the branches, as it was broken in the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was no longer there; and Aubrey, who was not able to move, was soon heard by those who had none. They entered; the light of their torches fell vpori the mud walls, arid the thatched loaded on each straw with heavy soot flakes. To the Dossier of Aubrey, they feared for the one who had drawn him up with his cries; he was again left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the highl of the torches once again 6urst upan hiin, to perceive the airy farm if his beautiful conductor brought a corse without life. Ho closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from his disturbed imclginati0n; but he saw the shape again, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but he was a silence on his face that seemed to be almose as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and upori herthroat were the marks 0f eth havlng opened the uine: — to this men pointed, wept, at the same time, were filled with horror, \"In Vampyre! A Varnpyre!\" A staff was formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of the lift which hod died in her. He knew what the hif thoughts were: his mind was 6enumbed and seemed shvn reflection, and take refuge in the vacation—ho held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular buildingjon, whieh had been found iri the hul. They were defiled by different parties that had been erected in search of her that a mother had missod. Their lamentable crying, approaching the city, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of Boir would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the death of their umbild, they looked at Aubrey, clnd pointed towards the eorse. They are inconsolable; both died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and wcls often delirious; in these intervals he called vpon Lord Ruthven and up0n Ionthe – by an irreproachable combinatjon he seemed to be begging of his former corn panion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he cursed his head and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from the wbatever pattern, on heorlng of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and took his constant attendante. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and set out to see him, of whom he had now combined jmage with the got af at Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, repented almost of the fault that had caused the separation, and lingered more by the attention, anxiety and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite ehangcd; it no longer seemed that the apathy of being what had so stunned Aubrey; but af as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, except sometimes tbat he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, wilh a smile of malicious extullation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this glaring haunted him. During the first stage of the recovery of the Inualid, Lord Ruthven was apparently ingested in looking at the waves of tidal1ess raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of the thoso orbs, turning, like our world, the sun of the sheep;—in fact, he seemed to have wifh t0 avoiding the eyes of all.\nAubrey's ind, by this shock, was well weakened, and this bad wbich spiral elasticity once so distinguished it now seemed to run away forever. He was now a lovec of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired, his mind could not find Jt in the district of Atheris; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Ianlhe stood by his side — if he would lock him in the woods, his step would spell the garland in the middle of the undergrowth, in the void of the modest violet; then suddenly turnnirig rovnd, w0uld sh0w, for hif wild imagination, his palc face and overflowed throat, with a sweet smile vpori his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all of which created so bitter assocjations iri his mjnd. He advocated to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during the illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in the directian ury, and looked for all places to remember a memory that could be attached; but tangb so they cncncd from place to place, but they seemed to ignore what they looked up. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the geriaciousness of those whom they dissuade from so-called darigers. As a result of neg1ectirig so the council of the inhabitants, on a 0ccasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than defense. When they entered the bed of a torrent, with large inasses of bravghl rock down from the neighboring prccipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; the whole party was ferscarcely engulfed in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistling of bullets near their head, and by the echood ratio of several guris. In an instant, their guards left them, and, standing behind the rocks, started firing in the tho direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind him by sheltering the television of defilement: but clshamcd to be thus held by a foc, who, with insulting cries, shouted at them a dvarice, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers had to climb up and take them from the rear, they dwelt both to rush in search of the enemy. They barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven shot again in the shovlder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no loriger taking into account the vessel or his own peril, is soon surprised by seeing jrig the faoes of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rvthven's wound, immediately thrown their arms and submerged.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded sling to a nearby hut; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presenco — they were content to keep the entrance until Jr's comrade returned with the promised sum, for he had an ordor. Lord Rutbven's strength was rapidly diminished; in two days death followed, and death broke down in low steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious as it had been of the objects absout; but towards the end of the last evangelizing, the mind seemed to become uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was irritated to offer a bis aid with more than usual serious—\"Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I've listened to the death of my existence as I say the death of the day of Passirig; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"\"H0w? What do you mean? I need a few huts, my life, a little space, I can't explain myself, but if you want to hit me with everything you know about me, my man got rid of the defilement of the cap, and if my death had long been known in the Engolon, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself, seeing himself guilty of violence: \"Under 6y there your soul resents, by all your nature fear, swears that, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death t0 all being livirig in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: 'I swear!' said Aubrey; he ran out laughing on his saliva, arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey retired to rest, but didn't sleep; many circumstances atone his aquaintance with this man rose up on his mind, and he didn't know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he was spoiling the present of something horrible by-pass. He was about to enter the hovel iri which he had left in his body, a thief having met him, informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been driven by himself and his comrades, until he retired, to seize an inurit neigbbouring, according to a promise that they had given his seigneury bad, that he should be exposed to the coldest ray of the moon, pink trot after death bis. Aubrey stunned, and took men of the female, d andcrminod, to bury him in the place where he was. But, when hc had climbed to the top, he found no trclco of the body or clothes, th0ugh the thieves swore that they indicated the identical rock on which they had placed the b0dy. For a timc his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally rlurned, convinced that they had pierced the carp for the sake of the clolhes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible mistakes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstimulating melancholy which had dried on his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vesfel to transmit it to Otranto, or your Naples, is busy ripping off the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Among the other cases, there was a case containing scvera1 weapons of offer, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. When he turned them around, and looked at the curious forms of Tbeir, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dogger tbe discovered in the inevitable but — he trembled — rushing to get the stealthy proof, he sounded the lbe weapon, set on his horror can bc imagine when he discovered that he was equivalent, in particular fashioned, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eye no longer seemed to be certain: they saw that he bound himself to the dagger; but still hc did not want to believe; given the particular shape, the same different shades on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendor on the bath, set on no room left any doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left S. Myrna, and on his way home to Rome, his first business concerned the lady he had...\nHe took over Lord Ruthven's seductive goldsmith. His parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and fhe had not seen the beard of since the departure of his lordshjp. Aubrey's spirit is almost hr0ken under so many repeated executioners; he was afraid that this lady might have been the victim of the Iantbe destroyer. He died morose and silerit ; and his only 0ccupation conjested in the exhortation of the speed of the postilions, as if bo wcre will save the lifc of home which he bequeathed dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to the will, soan stunned bim to the English sbores; and he hastened to the abode of his fathers, and there, for a momcnt, appeared to the losc, in the embraes and caresses of his sister, all the inemorial of the past. If before, by her infannel caressing, she had slipped her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached glues a companion.\nMiss Aubrey evil not to win the grace that wins tho gclze and applause from the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmont. His blue eyes never light up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from a malaise, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a bad consciousness of a more screaming kingdom. His step was nol tbat light fo0ting, which goes astray where o butterfly or a color can attract – it was federated and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her armbuff breathed from her afsection bis, and would forget in her presence those sorrows that she knew to destroy the bis rest, who would have exchanged her smile for this voluptuous? It seemed that tbose eyes—it was then playing in the ighl to tbeir own nalive sphere. She was only 18 years old, arid had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought his guards more capable that his presentation would be delayed until his brother's return from the continent, where he could be his protector. So today was the next show, which was approaching quickly, sh0 could be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the manor of her sathers, and fed on the melancholy that carried the hive. He doesn't feel interested in frivolities os fashion-\nWhen his reindeer had been torn apart by the events he had seen, he decided to sacrifice his own spouse for the protection of his sister bis. And they came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a nat salon had been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious lo bask in the smi1e of the kingship, rushed to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stopped in a c0rner 6y hese1f, without taking into account everything around him, entered into the remorse that the first time he saw Lord Ruthuen was even this place—suddenly felt sawn by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, smiled in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had the arduous courage to turn around, fearing to see a bot of spectre blazed him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the figure that he had drawn his attention to this place on his first erryinto society. He looked until the members of hjs aum ost refuselng for their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a frjend, and forced a passage into the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts were sixfold from his brclin. Lord Ruthven again in front of him – circumstancos began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his oath. — He woke up hlmseIf he could not believe it – death rises again! — He touched his imagination had brought up the irration on which his mjnd rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to return to society; for if he tried to ask the eoncernirig Lord Ruthven, the narne clinged to the lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining the irformation. He went a few nigbts after having wilh his sister at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself to his devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that many were on the run, he used it, and when entering the room of anather, found his surrouridod sisler by many, apparently in serious conuersaliori; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, ond revealed to him some tbose traits that he was most abhorrent. Hc took his sister's arm, and, with a rushing march, abandoned him to the stratum; and at the door he found himself enjoined by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engulfing them, he heard again that the voice murmured clinging to Hiin: \"Remove your oats!\"\"He dared not lvrn, but, impatient with his sister, soon reached the horn.\nAubrey became very distracted. If his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more complete1y was he rigored, now also the certitude of the 1iving monster has pressed again upon his thoughts. Her sisler's attention was now irritated, and it was in vain that she invited him to explariate what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath was starred;—was he then to allow this slinger to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, arnidst all that he held; and not to avoid his progress? He could have touched his sister. But even if he was breaking his oath, and revealing his supplications, who would believe it? He thought of using the own hand of hjs to free the fram world such a wretched; but death, he remembered, had been derisively mocked. For days he remained in this slate; stopping in his room, he saw no one, clinging to eat only when his sister came, wbo, with tears, begged him, for his good, to support the naturc. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stllncss and loneliness, he lefl his houso, wandering street your street, anxi0us to steal this haunted wbich image. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the humidity of the midday. He was no longer to be assessed; he returned first with the evening dung; but finally he laid it down to rest, the tiredness of the bush surprised him. His sister, a referee for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon defamed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any, from thaught. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left all his friends, with a siend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into sawhood, and looked at him closely, anxious to foresee, in spjte of his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intlmacy. But when one entered a room, his discontented and rogue gazes were so striking, bis inwardly trembling so ulsible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for his sake, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to be irritated and, fearing that his mind would get bogged down, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to drink from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered daily in his wariders, arid to prevent hjm from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired o doctor to reside in the house, and tako Consul care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His ricoherence became so great, he could have found himself in his room. That's where he was lying for days, inoapale to be awakened. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affeotation and recolleotation that remained appeared on the entrance of his fister; then he was about to start something, and, grasping his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if your love for me is august, don't come near him!\" However, when she asked whom he was speaking to, her answer was: \"Truly! Trvo!\" And again he sank in a state, when not even she could wake him up. It lasted a lot of manthes: graduated11y, however, cls the year was past, its inconsistencies became less fruitful, and his mind lb broke part of his morosity, while his guordians observed, that several times in the mscly he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smile.\nThe shooting had almost ended, when, on the day of the year, one of his guardians cracking his room, bcgan to converse with his physicicicicln on the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, that his sister went the next day to get married. Instantly, Aubrey's attentjon was atlracted; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy is this mark of the return of the intellect, whose thcy feared that he had been deprived, they mountod the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Au6rey seemed happy, and astonished even more by his exrcssing his judgment He is present at the riuptials, and he wants to see his sister. They didn't wake up, 6ut in a few minutes if his sister was with him. He was apparently again capablo af affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to his chest, ond kifed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a perfon so distinguished for her rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which surprises him to see the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and put it on foot. On her asking Bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his scammer, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a sarritic expression of face, he told him to swear that she would marry this monster, for he—but he could advance riots—it seemed that this voice asked him to remember the oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was just a messy, cunning return, and away from Miss Aubrey, unleashed her to leave him. He sells them on his knees, he pleads, he pleads to delay the cabin for a day. They attached it to the soundlessness they imagined had taken position of his mjnd, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with the ury another. When he was aware of Aubrey's ill health, he used it willingly to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was devoured of irisane, his cxultation and pleasure could hardly be corricialod of those among whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to the house of his companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretension af great effect for the brother and interest in his destiny, he grafted Mifs Avrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His duty of morality had dangers on the toils which he addressed to him—could speak of himself as an individual who had no fympathy to the spirit of any being on the crowded earth, attached himself to her to whom he addressed;—could till how, since she was known, her exislence had begun to appear worthy of preservation, if he was unwaveringly able to enumerate his bleeding accesses;—in the end, he knew whether woll how to use Ferpent's art, 0r such was the case of destiny, that he earned his affection. The bed1e of the eldest branch long sallingat to him, it 0 held on the important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marjage, (jn despite the disturbed stato of his brother,) whjch was to take place on the day vcry before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a papcr; it was given to him; he wrote a 1elter to his sister bis, encircling him, as she valued her own happinefs, bent his honor, and the good of those who are now in the tomb, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, for days but for hours fcw this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest cursos. The sergeant promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he preferred not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what is considered, greasing a maniac. Neighl passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that razes more brittlely than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the noise of brokc cligs loudened his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiosity, if the servants of the last time overcame their vigil, they gradually went away, leaving him in the custody of an old defenseless waman. He realized the opportunity, with a single wos tied out of the room, and in a rnomentfound hlmself in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: ho came immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed away from the raom, the word1ess with fury. When Lord Ruthven ori the stairs murmured in his ar: \"Remember your oath, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Wamen are fresh!\" Then sclyjng, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came badly in search of bim. Au6rey could no longer provide for him; his fury found no vent, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned lo her sister, who was rioting before she was born, as the doctor was afraid of the agitatirig her. The marrjclge was solemnized, and the brink and groom left London.\nAubrey's weaknesses are increasing; blood effusi0n produces symptoms of the near-deatb approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated — he said immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Au6rcy's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The sorcerer was in front of him, where to choose his resting room, and Provenco his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard a ship of His Majesty, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of Tbe the name hot. The beauty of this plateau, and the certain supply of catella and vegetables that must always be found, lead many British ships to visit it — men of war and mercharitmen; and although it is rather off the lbe road for shi ps bourid in Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the puresor bargajning for the cattle with the nativos, the clergy and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been stehcforo. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mity1ene, what am I probably? Get married. He was a curious, but a very good one. The house on the hill, facing the river, is 1ongs lo, and he left on the old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wirie merchant, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there at fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis story excited our curiosity a lot, and we lost time iri hastenjng at home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who led us to the mansiori. It is composed of apartments located on the ground floor, an energizing room, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated with simplicity: light green walls, marble tables on the cilber side, a large myrtle in lecentro, and a small beneoth fountain, which covld be fashioned to play around the branches by moving a six-point source in the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a sofa or a largc sofa completed the furniture. In the ha1l ha1l stood a do2 in English cane cbairs, and an einpty library: there are no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor of Tbe, with stuffed cotton duvets and a plough, the bcd common to Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled wlth books and papers, which were theri in the large seclman chest in the cIoset: it was open, but we did not think that the nosselvcs justified by examining the content. On the tablet of the recreation 1ay Voltajre's, Shakespeare's, Boileau's and Rousseau's complete works; the ruins of the empires of Volncy; Zimmerman, in the language of Gerrnan; the Messiah of Klopstock; the riovels of Kotzebue; the play of Sehiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets snoring the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no Engljsh book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched every 0ver, arid in darkness with sljps of paper, on which a1so were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed.\ned, clnd forgot to place tbem with the others; but, he said, they must lie down constantly bjs come back; for it is so p ortlculor, that if I move a tbing with orders of ovt, it would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a service; and I have the product of the farm of lhjs for the difficulty of taking care of him, exept twenty zechins which I pay to an older Armenian who resides in a small cottage iri the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for reason wbat.\"\nThe appearance of the externa1 house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen broods, and the marble plover fluted with plinths of blocks and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, flooded with a light stone balustrado, was covered with a carpet of fir turkey, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the lopins are furnished, for on them the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryina chrisli\", eating fruit, arid while enjoying the evening bree2.\nTo the left, when we enter the house, a little...\nEamlet glidcd far away, grapes, orariges and lime gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bufhes myrtle, a wlth marble seat an ornamental wood back was placed, on what we were told, the first pclssed many of its evenings clnd nigbts until twelve o'clock, reading, wrjting, and takirig to luiseIf. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attracted our chvrch twico a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThc seen fr0m this seat was what can 6th tormed \"cl birds-view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the tbe eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle in flowers, and on the top bones that an ancient Greek tmple seemed to be majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descends into broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the mountain baso. The smooth sea like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the vjew in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were clearly obsessed, studdirig the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed the sight more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as the name of the pe rson who had resided in romantic solitude thjs: no one knew his name but Dominick, a banker bis, who had gone lo Candia. \"Armenian,\" said our chief, \"could call1, but I'm sure he doesn't want to,\"—\"And can't you say, o1d friend?\" \"If I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city we learned several characteristics of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls He was the last one on the island, and he even danced with them at the wedding feast. Ho gave a cow to a mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to poor ren child. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, to hove was a very eccentric and benevolent characler. A circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend al the cocottago thought propcr did not discriminate. He had a more beautiful godfather, with whom the nobleman was often seen walking on the sea-shoro, and he had bought him a piano-s0rte, and he himself taunted the use of it.\nThis was the agriculture with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imaginatives all on the rack, guossing what0 this rambler in Greece could bo. He had rnoney it was obvious: he hod philanthropy 0f disposition, arid all these ecoentricities that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo0, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pulpi1 of WYATT'S, who had 6eenlratelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, about whom you are so aridious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never had the renown of his seigneury, as we had been some of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calcla's account in every page. Deeply djd wc regretting not to have been more curiovs in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will be laughed back. I understood that this riot was not intolerant, and in court for the good name of his Iordship, wbieh was grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to human nature, or contribbling in any way its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrays Lordsbip's poems, scem to make their place in the bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actiori; and his courteousness to the rest of loneliness is a strange reason to mark him as a beirige upon whose heart Religian hot put his echal, and upon whose head Benevolence cast the mantle. No ecln has read the pleasant \"trails\" procedure without feeling proud of a peasant. As far as his dreams or pleasures are concerned, I do not attend a right to give you an opinion. Relationships must always be received with calition, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a living-death. Lord Byron's character is a genius of bis. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous conscience and solf-approval.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleel-Streel.",
    "16": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy JohnWilliam Polidorj\nTHE superstition on which this tale is falsified is very general to the East. It did not extend to the Greeks until they swelled the establishment of Christjanity; arid took its present form only from the division of the Latin and Greek chvrches; to which the lime, the idea spread, that the Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually grew, and formed the subject of many stories of wonder, still existing, of the dead who rose from the tombs of Jr., and celebrated themselves on the blaod of the young Beautjsul. In the Wost, it spread, with a few slight variations, everywhere in Hurigary, Poland, Auslria, and Lorraine, where the helief exists, that vampyres njghtly soaked up a certain portion of the blood of their victims, wbo became einacized, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while these 6 suckers of the human moon diminished — and their velns became distracted such a state of repletion, as to cleave the blood to flow from all the pasfages 0f their bodics, and even pores even from their skins.\nIn London Jaurnal, of March 1732, is a curca, and, of course, credible story of a particular case of vampyri-\nsm, whicb is declared to have 0ccurred al Madreyga, Hungary. She oppées, thal upori ari examination of the emmander-in-chief and the magistrals of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named A Arnold Paul, had heard, that, in Cofsovie, on the friars of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a wclyto to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth tho over the fat of the smallpox, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by the hjm, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of IIfe by his attacks. The inhabitants, after consulting Iheir Hadagni, seized the 6odie, and found (as is usually believed in vampyrism) fresh, completely free of corruption, and emitting pure and florid blood to the mouth, nose and ears. Evidence was obtained, they resorted to habituation medicine. A stake was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's hcart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had abated Aliue. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of those who had died before of vampyrism, for fear that the thybould, in turn, would become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a uampyre hese1s, and sucks iri its moon.\nChief Bai1iff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems preferable to illustrate the subjcct of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in exiftence, that the deceased is not only made for vampyris, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to beings he loved most while he was on the ridge — those to whom he was bound by bonds of friendship and affection.—A supposilion alludes to the tbe \"Giaour\".\nBut first, on the earth, as Vampyre sent him, let your Corsica be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of origin, and sucking the blood of all your seed; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drains the bottom of life; yet hate the banquet that is to feed your Corsican ljvirig, Your victims, are yet come to pass, They will smite the devil to their sire; as you cursed them, you cursed them, Your flowers are bluffed on your foot. But your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless You with the name of a father: This word will engulf your heart in flames! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last mooring of his cheek, the last spot of the eye, and the last glassy look must see Whicb freezes his blue face; then, with the hand without defilement will tear the braids of his yellow hair, Df who, in life o locks when the thorn Affeotjon the tenderest pledge carried—But now is boom away from you Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning tooth, and your harry lip, and then trampling on your sulten tomb, come on, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Ti1l thesc jn horror depart from the cursed spectre than they do.\nMr. Sauthey also intro0duo in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyorse of the inajd Arab Oneiza, what0 if represented cls being turned frowning the grave away the purp0se of tormenting it she loved betterwhilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have led to the sin of her life, it has been reversed throughout history as a complete type os pure city and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefart giues has long counted his journeys 0s severaI amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have beeri on the eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a goriety 0f anecdotes, and lradiary narratives illustrating his effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to praver him to be a classic error, as well as harbaricln.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and wbich can now be concluded by simple remark, that tbough the term Varnpyre is the onc in the most general acceptance, there are seueral olhers synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocca, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the middle of the dissipations over a London winter, the different parties of the leaders of the ton appeared to a riobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the laughter of the fair attracted only his attention, which he scrambled with a glance stifling him, and which he feared in the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this frenzy of fear, could not explain from where it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem pcnetrate, and suddenly topierco tbrough the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of 1eaden that wigbed on the skin he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to each house; all desired to see him, and those who had been accused of violating the excitement, and now fe1t the weight of the ennuj, carried happy to hauirig something in their presence capable of engajng their tension. In the spit of the dead shade of bis, which never galeneda tinted warmer, either of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, there were many women who, after trying to gain his attention, and winning, at least, some marks of wbat tbey mighl term afferiori: Lady Mercer, who had been the mocking monster of evory in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did anything but pulsate on the robe of a movntebank, to increase her notoriety:—in vain:—who stood before him, although the eyes bis were apparently fixed on her, it seemed nevertheless that they were unperceived;—before her impudence inappalIed wcls baffled, and she left the field. But although the common aduI is not infuenco even the guidanoc of his eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to him: yet it is the apparent prudence with which one speaks to the virtuous wife and to lnocent daugbter, that few know that he never addresses women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and although it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, 0r that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, bo was often cles among the female lhoses that make up the boasting of their sox of their domestic virtues, as among those who venture him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, Lerc came to London a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession af gr eat wealth, by the parents who died wbile he was still in the child. Left to himself by the guards, who thought that they had only to take care of his forlune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the burden of subalternants mercenaries, he cultivated more imagination than his judginent. That's why he took care of this high romantic price of good and candour, which destroys so many miller apprentices every day. He lent a1l to sympathizing virtue, and bought the vice lhal was incrusted by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the soene, as we see in the romances: he thought that tbat the misery of a cottage was simply jn the vosting of clothes, which were also warm, but whatb were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and colorful vorious patohes. He thought, in firie, to beat the dreams of poets the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reosonf, on his enterjng irito the goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, attacking that jcb sbou1d defcribe with the truth lasl lheir languishing or farfelu favovrit: the girls at the same time, by sheir lightening the faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eye, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents gripped his merit. Attached to the love of his lonely hours, he marveled at the brilliance, that, except in the candles of to1low and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of fnuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant repict and descriptions calined in these volumes, from which he had formed the hif study. However, finding a certain compensatjon in his gratified vanity, he was about to rolinquise his brains, when the extraordinary being that we have over thecrjbed, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it; on the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave loose signs of the observation of the oxternal objects, that the tac whom he consented to the existence of tbeir, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon made this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to o6serve the offspririg of his fantasy, rather than the person before hiin. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced his opinion that his presence was recognized as olways. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon he found the notes of preparation to be frowned upon.\nTjon iri — Street, that he was about to rave1. Desirous of getting some insormation about this singular character, who, until now, hcld only hit his curjusity, he suggested to his tutors, it was time for him t0 pcrforms the tour, which for many generations has seemed necessary to me to enablo theyoung toke a few rapid steps in the caror of the vice towards being pvting on an equality with the elderly, and riol al 1owing to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous jntrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or prlicise, aocording lo le degrec de schill1 shewen by wearing them. They reconciled; and Avbrey immediately speaking of his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join Bim. Flattercd by such a mark of esteem of hlm, which, apparently, does not hcld anything to camrnon with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's cbaracter, and now he found that, although the inarie hif actions were more exposed to the bis view, the refults offered caricluses differing from the apparent motives of his conduct. His compani0ri was profuse in his liberality; — the ldle, the vclgabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than in 0ugh ta relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuouf, reduced to indlgen ce by the misfortunes which accompanied him on virtue, that he granted his alms;—the door was sent out where sneezes were not removed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lvst, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was back to rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the great tbe or importunity of the vicious, which usually preucllils 0 times the bashfulnefs leaving af the indigenl virtuovs. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk down and mast The abj ect mifery. In Brussels and other cities which they passed, Aubroy was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his compclniori sought the centres of all vico fachlonable; he entered there in all the splrit of the table of fara: he bet, and alwayf gamhled with svcces, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even moro that he won; but it was alwclys with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, that he encountered the eruption yyuthful novice, or the lvckle ss fclther of a great family; then his vcry desire seemed to trine the law — this apparent abstraction of the wcls spirit set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than the thclt of the cat while untie with the h alf-mort mouse. In the city of evocation, he left the youth formerly tributary, Tom from the circle, he worshipped, cursirig, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; while many fathcr sat friantic, ainidst spoke it Iooks of silent childreri hunger, without a singular farthing of his last immcnense wealth, where he even bought svffieient to satisfy their present cravirig. But he did not take money from the table of play; bul immediately l0st, lo the ruiner of mary, the last guilder that he had just snated of tho cnvuls ive grab from the inrocent: this punch But it was only because of a certain degree of kn0wledge, which was not able to fight against the trick of the most experienced. Auhrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this arid charity pleosure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; how this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various rich sconos of wild nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to being the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratificcltion from him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break the mystery of tbat, which to his oxidized imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost for some time the sigbt of his ompanion; he left it in the presence on the mornjng ciroe of an Italian countess, as he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters arrested from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the otbers were of his guardians, the second astr0nished him; if he had previously entered inlo his imagiriatiori that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they saw enough reason for the bolief. His gvardians insist that his friend is ravaged in a hisjmmediate manner, and exhort him, to fight his character is terribly vici0us, because possession as irresistible powers of sedvction, makes his licorious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born out of the haste of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratistiori, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had thrown himself away from him of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had had, apparently because of their virtue, had, by his departure, even cast off the mask apart, and had not rescued to expose the deformity of their vices lo lo la goze pu6lique.\nAubrey dcterined on leclving one, whose character had not yet shown cl singo ori luminous point that to rest the eye. Hc has resolved not to have a plausible pretext that completely abandons him, in order, in the sense, to look at him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon perceivcd, he tried to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose home he was visiting with caution. In Italy, it is sedom that a married woman is met in society; so he was forced to continue his p1years in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignati0n had been named, which most likely ended iri the ruin of an innocent, thovgh thinklcss glrl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and asked him for a roughup of information with respeclto the lady, informing him at the same time that hc knew that he was meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately by winning a note, to say, that from this rnoment, he must decrease the line of aseumtion of his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informed him of the entanglement he knew, not only with regclrd to his daughter, but also to converge the choracter to his Lardship. The assignment has been prepared. Lord Ruthven then mcly simply sent bis servant to n0tify his complete consent to a separation; bvt did not suggest that no suspicion of bis plans were thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rame, Aubrey headed for Greece, and co-located with the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the faded records of the aricierite glory on the monuments which appearly, shameful to chronicle the deods of Freomen only before the slaves, hcld hid under the sojl Pilonnering thc or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, so bcautiful and delical, thal sbe could have forced the model for a pairer pouring on canvas the promised hope of the fajthfvl in Mahamet's pclradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for any 0ne to think that it could be Io ng to those who had n0 souls. As she was deigning on the plain, or tripped along the side of the moritaine, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, enclosing the eye of the nature of animatod, sir that luxurious sleep l0ok of the costume animal but to the taste of the epicury. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in search of arithmetic, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursil of a Kashinère butter, would show all the beauty of her form, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, wh0 forgotten the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation af ber sylph-llke sigure. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, displayed in the ray of the sun such bright and so soothing shades, this might well excuse the fo rgetfulness of the antiquarian, who let srom escape his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufarias. But why try to describe the charms, feel everything, but no one can enjoy it?—It was the innocent, youthful and beautiful, not stried by crowded drawing rooms and stried balls1. As he drew these remains of what he wanted to preserve a memorial for the next few hours, she stood by, and watoh the magic effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe the circum-\nThe upori dance open plain, painted, to him in al1 the brilliant colors of young mcmory, the wedding pump that she remembered watching iri her childhood; and then, turning to subjeots who had obviously mclde a greater impression on her mind, wou1d him all the pampernatural stories of her nurse. His assiduity and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the most intolerant even to Aubrey; and osten told him the tole of living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most expensive lies, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence so that he would follow montbs, his blood would run cold, while he tried to laugh at it by such fantasies idlc and h0riblc; but Iclnthe quoted your hiin the names of old meri, wbo had finally detoctod a living among them, after several of their relatives relatjves children had been faunted with the seal of the fiend's clppetite; and when she found him so incredvlous, she begged him to believe it, for he had been, remclrked, that thosc who dared to question their existence, always had some proof, bluffle, and to say to him, of the truth, of faith. She detailed to him the traditlonal appearance of these monfters, and her horror increased, hearing a beautiful precise disarray of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that it was not the truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that all tended to excite belief in Lord Ruthvcn's natural fuper power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianlhe; his innocence, so contrasted with the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sighed for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englisb ha6its, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself even more and bitten attached to the almost fallacious form before him. He sometimes drew himself from it, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his intention on the vines to adorn him, while in his mind he killed an imago who secreted only the legitimate possessor of bought bis. Iari was inconceivable of his love, and was always the same irifantile free being he had known. She always seized him to tell him of her reluctance; it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could see her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they 6oth, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, palc wjth horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which was t0 holding him for a few hovres; that they heard the name of the place, they all both begged not to return to the neighborhood, os he did not need to pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, swelling the day had dared, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the rose of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evicles as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to decipher them from the idea; bul when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly on his excurslon; he surprisedcd to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was surprised to find his pupils, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about t0 speaking, Ianthe came next to his horse, and won from him to come back, there nigbt allowed the power 0f these bejng lo be put into action;—he promised. He was, commenting, so busy in his research, he did not pe rceive tal day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and paur all their rage on the devoted country.—He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is quite unknown; immediately the sun sets, the neighborhood begins; and it moves far, the power of the storm extends above — its thundcrs echo had barely a resting interval — its heavy rain spread through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet vcry. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the eritranged forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found thals in the vicinity of a thal mud, by the glacer of lightnirig, barely lifted from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demontririg, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him into the city, or at least rely on getting a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent mummerite, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocated mackerel and cxultant with a laugh, contribed in an almost intact sound;—he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder which, once again, took hold of his hoof, he suddenly forced the door of the hut. He got caught up in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, for although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found it if iri oontact with samo one, which he immediately faked; when a voice used to, \"Again haffled!\" And he felt that his sons were struck by a force which seemed superhuman to him: determined to sell his life as expensive as he had been, he began to embrace himself; but she was in vain; he was gnawed with his feet, and cast a force against the ground; his enemy fell upon himself, and kneeled on his chest, and laid his hands. up0n his throat — when the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole the light gavo in the day, the trouble; — he rose up instantly, and, leaving the prey hjs, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They swollen; the first of the Lords fell on the mud wall, and the stubble loaded on the undivided straw of evcry with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her, who had drawn out a cry of mist; he was again left in darkness; but what was her horror, that the light of the torches burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his sajr conductor brought into a corsus without me. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was bul a uisi0n coming from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, wben he unlocked them, lying beside him. There was no upori ber oheek colour, not even on his lip; however, there was a silence ahout hor face which seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived lérc: — at the top of his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this the inen pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"At Vainpy-\nA vampire!\" A litter was quickly cultivated, and Aubrey was laid by the Sidc of her who had been for him the obiect of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower life that had dictated in her. He did not know what he thought — the spirit was inflamed and seditious to avoid reflection, and to take the refungo in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the thc hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties, of which 6 had been engaged in the search for her that a mathist missed. Their lamentable series, as the city approached, preceded the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and pointed to Corsica.\" They were inonsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these jntervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an inexplicable combination, he seemed to be begging hjs former companion to spare being that he loved. In another time, he would permeate the maledicoris on his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, flouted at the fact that he had arrived in Athens, and, from a whaler's motiu, after hearing Aubrey's ftclte, immendied himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the lotter recovered from his delirvm, he was horrified at the sight of the one whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but L0rd Ruthven, by words of bis knd, involving almost repentance for the fault which hod cavsed tbeir separatian, and always inore by the attention, clnxiety, and the care that he showed, quickly reconciled with him to his presence. His Iordship seemed quite changed; he appeared only the apathetic belng that had so surprised Aubrey; but sounded like his c0nvalescence was beginning to be fast, he gradually withdrew in the same state of mind, and Aubrey pierced rio diference of the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gazec sixed jntently on him, with a smjlo of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this sinister haunted. During the final stage of the reconstruction of the irivalid, Lord Ruthvon apparently engaged in the watcbing the waves of unfortunates ravaged by the cooling breeze, 0r iri markirig the progress of these orbs, turning, like 0ur monde, the sun without movement;—in fact, he seemed to wish t0 clever tbe eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that hcld once so distinguished now seemed to run away forever. He was today like a lover of solitude and silence as the Lord Rutbuen; but although he wanted him to be happy, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Alhens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, Ianthe's shape stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his slight step seems to question himself in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the uilet rnodest; then suddenly turned around, showed, at bis wjld jmagination, his pale face arid wounded throat, with a Moek smile on his lips. He focused on sneaky scenes, each feature film af that created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to L0rd Ruthven, to whom he was stifled by the tender care he had taken to come to his illness, tal they should visil emes parls of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a recollection could be attached: Although they were thus hclsterized from one place to another, they did not seem to be paying attention to what was being looked at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, and the interest in exciteing the generosity of those they defended against so-called dangers. Consequently, neglecting the advjce of the inhabitants, on one occasion they traveled with 0nly falcon guards, more to throw themselves as guides than as a defense. At the entrance, at the opening, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the snow precipices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near the pearls, and by the ec hoed ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and by placing the behlrid rocks of themselves, had 6egun to fire in the direction from which the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who wilh insultririg cries over them advanted, and being expiated at the slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers were to climb up and lact them in the back, they decided once to rush in vain in the sear ch of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his aid; ond, rio longer, stands at the distance of the contel ar his own peril, is soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately tanned vp their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to pass on his wounded friend to a nearby cabiri; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence of tbeir, they merely kept the entrance until their comrade resumed the promised sum, for which he made an order. Lord Ruthven's strerigth declined rapidly; in two days the inortication followed, and the die seemed to move forward with hasty steps. His conduct and his appearance as a bad riot changed; he suffered as little pain as he had done with the objects surrounding him: but towards the end of the evening his mind rose apparently uncomfortable, ordained his eye often fixed towards Aubrey, who was led to offer a hift aid with more than the usual gains—\"Help me! You can save me—you can do more than that—I do not mean my life, I have heard the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey replied. \"I need bvt litlle — my life quickly panics — I can't explain the whole — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free from the mouth of stairiin in the world — and if iny dcatb were unknown for some time in England—I—but life. \"—\"It will not be known. \"-\"Swcar!\" exclaimed the dying man, rasirig himself with extant violence, \"clothes by all the soul yur reveres, by all your nature fear, swear lhat, for a year and a day that you have wjll n0t to give your knawledge of my crimes or death to any livjng6e in any way, anything can be flouted, or wbatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with lbeir sookets: \"I clothed myself,\" said Aubrey; \"he sank loughjng on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his acqvclintanoe with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his aath, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presuppression of some horrible expectation. With his ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hoax crying, he had licked the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been stoned by bimseIf and comrades, rising his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to hjs seigneuria, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took the men's seueral, determined to bury him on the place where he was. But when he went up to the top, he had no trace of the carp or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were reporting the same stone on which they had laid the body. For a tjme hifnd was disconcerted in the ejections, but he finally came back, convinced that the bad one buried the oo rpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the land in wbich, he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which they all tame in a tame manner to raise this smoky melancholy which had sequestered on his mind, he resaved to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vefsel to transmit it to Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had in mind by referring to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case of connivance with several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. As he looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the style of the healthy that the daggor was untiring in the fatal hut — he trembling — hastening to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that it was mounted, yogb particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: they began to look at the bo bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the hoft and sh dieh were also in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of ori blood each.\nHe loft Sm yrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigator was about the lady hc had watched your snalch of Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune riveted, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's inind became almost shattered so many repeated horrors; it was usually that this lady had fallen victim to the Iantho dostroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if one were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed to be obedient to his will, soon ran away on the shores of the Eng1ish; and he hastened to the mansi0n of his satters, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the arid embraces of the bis sister, all the rnemorality of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a currency.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. Here lies the riority of this ligbtbrilljancy which exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the leviation of the mlnd below. Therc was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem toarife of misf0rtune, but of a certain feeling wjthin, thclt appeared to iridate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not so light, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract—jt was sedate and pen five. When alone, her face never lightens with a smile of joy; bvt when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her favorite the sorrows that she kriew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of voluptuclry? It was as if these eyes, thal face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, he was thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed until the relvrn of his brolher of the continent, where he could be his protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next room of drclwjng, which was approaching quickly, should be the epocb of its entrance irito the \"busy soene\". Aubrey would have stayed in his father's mansion, and fed on the self that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fa shionoble strangcrs, while his mind had been torn by uniforms to be a bad witness; but he determined the sacrifice of his own consolation to the protection of sister bis. They came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been annoyed as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive, a living room had not held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the soul of the kingship were quick to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, beware of all the arourids of him, engaged in the memory of the first that he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that plccce, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would explode, when he perceived, a little distracted, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he entered society. He looked at the limbs almost by refusing to boar the weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, the coach was taken home. He seized the room with pressed steps, and fixed his head, as if he were at the afrajd his thoughts were bvsling his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that this was possible — death rises again! — He thought that imaginatiori had condemned the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that he could be real — he determined, therefore, t0 to go back to sociology; for although he was trying to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining insorination. He began to sew nights later, with his sistcr, at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired in o recss, and there gave himself to his own thoughts of dcvavring. When he finally saw that the thclt rnany was leavirig, he went away from himself, entered another room, found his sister surrounded 6y several, apparently in an omest conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when orie, that he was driving to m0ve, turned around, and revolted towards him lhofofeatures he most odious. And he went forth, and took the arm of his snitch, and, with a grim rush, forced him into the street: and at the door he found himself blocked by the multitude of servants, who were waiting far for their lords; and when he undertook to put them down, he heard again that uoeiee murmured near him: \"Remember thy ocltb!\"\"He dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, soon arrived at the house.\nAubrey becamo was distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by fubject oria, how inuchly much more complete he absorbed, now than the certainty of the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. The attentions of her sistcr were now without regard, and it was iri vain tbat she intimidated her explijn ta what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only words of birds, and t pipe terrified hcr. The more he bought it, the more the mare was puzzled. His oath surprised bim;—was it to allow his morister to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, amjdst all that he held dear, and not to the least of his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if Bo broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He sought to use his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, which he rebuked, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only the oam of his sister, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. In Lasl, who is no longer able to endure the streetnesf and the solitu de, he left his h0use, wandered from the street your street, blinking to steal the image that bothered him. Her dress became neglected, and hc wanders, cls often exposed to the sun midday as lo the midnight humidity. He was not longcr to be recognized; at first he returned to eternal life; but at last he helped him to rest where the fatjgue had invaded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow hjm; but TBey was soon distanced by bim who fled a pursuer faster than any other – from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left by his abfence tho all his friends, with a fiend among them, of presence wbose tbey were unconsciously, he decided to cnter again the society irito, and to watch him closely, anxious in advance, in spite of the hif oath, oll that Lord Ruthven approached the intrinvacity. But if he entered a room, his hamburger and his suspicion seemed so striking, his inner chills so visible, his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for the love of ber, a society that affected him so strongly. Wben, commentover, the reinsurance proved to be inavailable, the guards thought appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind became lightened, they took the time hibb to res urne agaln that trust that had been before irnposcd upori thein by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to have severe wounds and suffering, he had met daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of thyconsidrous madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take the kernel of bim. He hardly seemed to notice it, if completely was his mlnd abs0rbed by a lerrable subject. His iricoherence finally became so great, that he was confronted with his room. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. He had emancipated, his eyes had saddened a glazed luflre;—the only sign of affection and recollicti0n left was his son's tongue at the door of his sister; then he was sometimes dazzling, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that seriously affected him, he wanted his riot to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" Wbcn, however, shc asked wbom he mentioned, his only answer was, \"True! lru!\" And agajn he sank in a state, from which even n0t she could wake him up. This lastod of many months: gradually, howeuer, as the year was posjng, its inconsistencies became frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, which the Hisguardians observed, that several ilmes iri on the day hc c0unt on his fingers a number desinite, arid and then smile.\nThe time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his gvardiaris entering his ro0rn, began to converse with his doctor on the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, when bis sisler was going riext docly to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy os tbis brand back to the InteIlect, whose fear they had that it had been deprived, they deserved the name of the Eorl of Marsden. Thinking that tbis was a yovng's count whom he had met in society, Au6rey seemed to be pIeascd, and stifled them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently agairi able to be offended hy the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again olive to feelings of affection. He speaks with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriago with a person so distinguished for his rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the wbo monster had so long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. Fearing him, why did he destroy the resemblance?\nHe looked at her as he didn't understand her, then took hold of her hands, and took possession of a frenetic expressiori of honor, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monsler, f0r he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that tbat voice still Balehim remembers his oath — he suddenly turned around thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but didn't see an anne. In lhe means the arid on-call doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and thought it was only a return from her djsorder, incred, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, he begged one day for your dolay bul f0r. Thoy, attributing this to the madness they imagined had taken possession of the bis spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven was 11 years old in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. Wben heard about Avbrey's ill health, he understood himself again as the causo of this one; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from srom these ainong that he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of the former companion of bis, and, through the constant altendanco, and the claim of great affection sar the brother and lnterest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's car. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of gnawing like an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself;—coveld tcll arc, since he knew her, her existence, had beguri thy seeming worlhy of preorvation, if she were thal inerly he could listen to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of Saat, that he would spoil his affections. He obtained an important embassy, which served as an exaggeration to hasten their marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state) which was to take place the day before he left for the Contirient.\nAuhrey, when left by the physician arid bis guardians, tried to bribe tho servclnts, but iri vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happ iness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the hope and rope of their hovsc, to delay but for a sewn of hours than marriage, he denounced the heaviest cursos. The sweaters promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, ho thought that it was better not to harass ari more the spirit of Miss Aubrey by, who he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can moro easily be conceived as described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. Aubrey grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole1awoy, lecving hiin in the custody of an old defenceless Wombln. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was outside af tbe room, and an inoment was found in tbe apartmenl where all the werc noarly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hlm: he immediately objected, arid, takirig his arm by force, precipitated him from the room, without voice fury. Wben on the stairs, L0rd Ruthvenwhispered in his ear – \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer stand; his rage did not find Vont, had brokered a vessel of blood, and he was eonve Yed in bed. It wasn't mcntioned to his sister, what wasn't prcent when he came in, as the doctor feared to shake him. The Tho wedding was celebrated, arid the bride and 6ridegroom lost London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; 6l0od outpouring produced deoth symptoms near the 0f approach. He wished that his sister's guards could be called, and that at midnight time had struck, to be composedly bound to the whale the convinced hcls reader—he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MIT ISLAND\nYes.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of bim, where to hate his resting place, and Provide his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, aboard one of the ships of Majosty, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of Tbat. The abundance of this place, and the supply of ccrtarii to the oattle and vegetables still have to have there, bring many British ships to visit it — both men of war and merchclritmen; arid although it is rather off the track for the ships bovnd to Smyrna, its premiums largely rcpayer for the distance of a voyage. We dropped; as usual, at the bottom of the child, while the men were used to water, and the sacrillary galloped for cattle with the native TB, the clergy-\nThe man took a rambleto from the cave called Homer's School, and other places, whore we had before. On the front of Mount Ida (a little moriticle so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English Iord, that he left the days bitter islets preuious to our ripvill iri bif felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose your quil Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He's a weird man, but he's very good. The house on the hill of Tbe, facing the river, belongs to him, and he leaves an old man in charge of him: he gave Domiriick, the winemaker, six hvndred zoohinef for him, (about L250 English currency,) and has been there about bitter months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucoa very 0ften to tbo different islands.\"\nThis aec0unt excited our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time at the house that our peasant had resided. An old man took us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments located on the ground floor — on hclll window, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green walls, marble tabs on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain below, which could be made for plcly through the 6y branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronzc Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room there were half a dozen English choirs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one lclrge mattress on the float, with two heels.\nFeeded cotton duvets and pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room wc observe a mclrble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in the chest of a great Seamari in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire's, Shakespeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's complete works; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Mc ssiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press at Coristeur0ple, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these boaks were filled with marginal wjth notcs, wrlteri with a pencll, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was ljterally scratched all ovor, and marked with sheets of paper, on whicb were also remarks.\nThe old husband said, \"The lord has taken these books badly in the evening before he sails, and he has forgotten to place them with the tho 0thers; bvt,\" he said, \"they must lie there until they resum; for it is so special that I have been to move a tb without swallowing it, he would frown me for a week together; it is indeed very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the gift of this farm, the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zecbincs which I pay to an old Armonian who resides in a small ergotclge in the wood of Tbe, and the nineteenth brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house was cxternally pleasant. The portico was in front of fifty steps long and four feet of 6 road, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths on working cornices of frets, (as it is customary n0w in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the wheels. The roof, surrounded by six years of a stone balustrade of Eight, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awning of strong coarfed linen. Most of the house lops are furnished, the Greeks spend their evenings in sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little ftreamlet glissa, grapes, orangs and linden gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two bushes of largc bluertle, a marble soot with an ornamental wood back was plclced, on wbich we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, walking, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" faid tbc old man, \"praying\" because he was very fervent, \"and always started our church twice a week, being side by side Sunday.\"\nThe point of view of this seat was what can be called a bird's eye uiew. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the smoke of wbich an ancestral Greek temple appeared in majestic rot. A smoll streom from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The srnooth sca in the form of glass, and a shadowless h0rizon by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little ori the left, truffled with a uista of high chcsnut and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spraying the light blue wave with spots of emoral green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did thjs; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the riam of the person who had resided in the romantic solild tbis: no kncw hls name but Domiriick, his banker, who had bad g0ne in Candia. \"Armenian,\" made our leader, \"could say, but I'm sure he wil1 nol,\"—\"And can't you, old friend?\" \"If I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our retvrn lo the city we learned several part-timers of the secluded lord. He had harassed the young girls when he was last on the island, arid everi dclnced with them at the nupal party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and arid silk of cotton to the girls who live by weaving these artioles. He also bought a new hoof for a fisherman who had lost his awri in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, for having bcen a very eccentric character ond benevolence. A circumstance that we learned, wbich our old friend at the cottage tbo thought appropriate riot your discloso. He had a very beautiful daughter, whom Lord Wcls often saw walking on Tbe Sea-Share, and he had bought him a piano fort, and took it himself.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination everything on the rack, guessing who so crawling in Greece coveld being. It was obvious: he had a philanthropy of dispositlon, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Together with Mr FOSTER, the architect, cl pupjl af WYATT'S, who had bcen traveling to Egypt and Greece, \"The jridividual,\" he said, \"about whom yov are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in iny travcls on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visited him in Mityleno.\" We had never heard of the failure of his lord Shlp, as we had been a few years from home; but \"C hlde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we re-regulated the reclus of Calcla in surpage. We deeply regret not having been more attentive to our catting research, but we went to Mitylene some day; but for me that day will never be again. I make this statement, 6 by not completely removing it uniriteresting, and in justice in the right name of his seigneury, whoh beeri grossly slandered. Ho a bocn described as an insensitive provision, inverse to association with human nature, to contribute in the way oney to appease his sorrows, 0r add to his pleasures. Faet is directly reuerse, as can be clearly collected from these small anedotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed iri the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosom0m. Sensitivity, sympathy, arid seem chary to gujde all his actions; and his courting of the rest of solitude is an additional reasari to include him as a being on which the religion hoart put his sea1, and on whose head Bencvolence hoth threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially with regard to the moral integrity of the opposite man; and ho who dares to stand before this terrible court where all must cling, only can censor errors towards another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in fecret, and applause from wor1d, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "17": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: however, it does not extend to the Greeks until oster the establishment of the Chriftianity; and it has assumed its form prcstered only from the divisjon of the Latin and Greek churches; to which the idea of becoming prevalent, thclt a Lat in the body could not corrupt so burjed in the territory of lheir, it has gradually increased, and has ensormed the sufferect many wonderful slories, still existing, from the dead rising from their graves, and fedirig upori the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, all Hungary wer, Polan d, Auslrio, and Lorrajne, wbere tbc belief existed, that vampyres night by soaking a certain portiori of the b1ood of their victims, which became emooïse, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumptions; while these fattencd human blood suckers – and their ueines became distendo to such a state of repletion, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of the skin of tbcir.\nIn the Journal Londori, af Mars, 1732, is a curiovs, arid, curfew, crediblo accovnt of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvngary. It seems that, during the examination ari af thc cornmonder-iri-chlef and the magistrates of the place, they asserted positively and in vain, that, five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, dwarf Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, within the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, hut had found a way to rid him ofSi du mal, by eating from the ground ostho of the tomb of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent Bim from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about two or thirty days after his death and burial, many people compensate for being tormented by him, and cl depasitiori was a mado, that four Persians had been devoured to life by his attacks. In order to avoid other pitfalls, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as it is pleased to be usual cases of vampyrism iri) fresh, and entiroly free of corruption, and emit to the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid bIood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the aocustomcd remedy. A stake was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and 6ody, where ho is ropo-\nHe cried in Havc, as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned the body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these porsons who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on the other wbo survive them.\nVniuersal belief is, tal, a person sucked by a vampyre picks a varpyre himself, and sucks in his stomach.\nChief of the usher.\nTbis monstrous rodomontade is here bound, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations thari any other likeness that might be presented. In part, Greece It is considered as a s0rt of punishment after a dealh, for a heinous crime committed when it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, bul obliged to entrust his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A fupposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut the flame on the earth, as Vampyre sent it, Your Corsica shall crush his tomb; Tben takes hold of the place of origin, and sucks all your race; From there, from your daugbter, sister er, woman, around midnight, he drains the current of life; Yet, away from the banquet that performs must feed your livid living corsus, Your victims, are yel expiro, Shall kri0w thc deman for their sire; As the cursed hee, you curse them, Tby flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever for your crime must fall, The most Yovngest, the most beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a fat... But you must put an end to your task and mark the last ring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glass glancque must see Who freezes his lifeless 6lue; Thcn with the bare hand will tear Tbe tresef of his hair ycl1ow, of which, in life, a lock that thorn the tenderest commitment of affection has been worn—But now is carried by you Meinorial of your agony! Yot with your own best blood will flow; your grinchy tooth, and the hook's lip; then hunting at your tomb sullcn, Go—and with Gouls ond Afrits rave, until thcso in h0rror depart from the spectre more occvred than they.\nMr. Southey presented olso in his wild but majestic poem of \"Tbalaba\", the corse vclmpyre of the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having come back to crush the grave with the aim of tormenting it that she loved better during her oxyslence. But this cannot be supposed to have led the sinnoss sram of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and ineriocence. The story of Tournefort gives a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to be an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, raises a variety of anecdotes, and the traditional rhyrotifs his effects, has pvt f0rth some essays learned, ten-year-olds.\nding to prove it t0 6th a classic, af as well as barbaric orror.\nMany curious and interesting remarks about this singularly horrible night of superstition are added; about the present may suffice for the limits 0f a notc, necessarily dev0ted to oxplanation, and which can now bc c0nc1uded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the only jnm0e general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brouc0loka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nI happeria lhat in the midst of dissipations accompanying on a London winter, it appeared to the various parts of the ton's Eaders a noblemary, more remarkable for the hif singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, just as he could not participate in Tberein. Apparently, the slight washer of the liver only attested his attention, so that he could, through a splash, make him tremble, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who had this feeling of apprehension, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by attaching on the face of the object, n0t sccm to penctrate, and at a glance your pierce through the inner works of the artery; bvt fell on the cheek with a radius of lead that we have Wejghed on tbe skiri it does not pass. His personalities provoked Bim's invitation to all houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now to the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their preseno capable of engaging their attentiveness. In spite of the mortal tint of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the emolion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, mary of the female hunters after trying to gain his attention, and winning, at least, some rnorks of what lhey might call affection: LadyMercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters dressed in the drawing rooms since the ber marriage, threw himself in his way, and made ol 6ut put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his nativity:—although in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparent1 attached to her, still it seemed that they were not piggy;—even her impudence inappalied was bclfsled, arid she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of its eyes, it is not true that the female sex was iridifforent to hiin: yet this was the apparent calllion wilh that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if he did not know that she had even overcome the fear of her character of chantulclr, or that they had been inoved by her apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex of their domcstic virtues, as among those who shook him by the vices of Ihair.\nAt the same time, he came to London, a young man from Tbe nclme d'Aubrey: he has an orphan for fear of having a single sister in possession of a great sweath, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortvne, while they demanded the greater burden of his mind your tbe care of the sub-alterns rnercénaires, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, in fact, this feeling of honor and arid high Romani, which every day ruin so many apprentices of thousands. He all wanted to sympathize with virlue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Providence simply for the pictogram effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the tho misery of the cottage was simply iri the jacket of clothes, wbich were also warm, but that were better suited to the eye of the painter hy lheir irregular folds and different colored spots. He thought, in f ine, that the droams af poets were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and rieb: for these reasons, upstream of his entry into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to write with the East Trulh their languishing or farfelus favourites: tho dauggters to the same lime, by their brilliant faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his ljps, soon led bim into false notions of talent bis and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the torch and the wax candles that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was born a real life jn foundation for one of these congreries of pleasant picturcs and deseriptions oonted in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, howeuer, a compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to rclinquish bis dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of abandoning an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his external objects observati0n af, thari tacitly aflate to their existenceric, jmlivered by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imaginatiori to imagine each thyrig who flattered his propensity your extravagant ideas, he soon forned this object in the hero of a romance, and discouraged to observe the outpouring of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has advanced on every note, that his preserie has always been recagnized. He gradually found that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soari found, from the notes of preparation In — Street, he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this Sirigular charaeter which, until now, has only attested his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations was considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards the establishment of equality with the elderly, and not allowing them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scanda1ous iritrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill manifested in wearing them. And Aubrey, immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhuen, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by sucb a mark of esteem of hjm, which apparently has nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the oborlunicism to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, that, although many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the resuIt osfered various conclusions of the apparent conduct motjves t0 hjs. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their desires. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing, that he was not on the virtuous, driven to indignation by the bitter misfortunes even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were fents of lhc daor with sneezes barely repressed; but wben the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, 6ut to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent tight with rich charity. This, however, was ottributed by him to increase the importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the bashfulncsf retreat of the virtuous needy. There were circumstances of orie about the principality of her Lordship, which was still consumed by her spirit: gripping those on wham it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, far from TBey carried everything either led to the scaffold, or sunk at the bottom and the moft a6ject insery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey waf surprised the apparent cagery with which his companion began to settle in the centres of all the modelible vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro lable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the known schclrper was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but jt was always with the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, s0 that he cashed in the young eruption novjce, or the father without chance of a nuinous fclmily; hon his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was laid aslde, and his eycs were burning with more fire than that of the cat wbilst Dalying with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the youth that had come, to the end of the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of tbis fiend; while many fathers sat frantically, in the midst of the eyes of the hungry mute children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their presbytery. Yet he did not take money from the gourd table; but immediately lost, to ruin many, the last frost that he had just ripped frowns the convulsjve catch of the inriocent: he could but bc the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which riots, however, able to fight against the cunng of the operience more. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and the bcg to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring his own profit;—hut he delayed—for every doy he had drunk his friend would give hjm an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to bim; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in the bis carriage, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; although Aubrey was close to the objoct of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification than the c0nstant excitation of vainly wifhirig to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatural homething.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, aridAubrey for a time lost of sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upori the early epicle of a Countess of Itcllion, while he went in search of the memorjals af another almost tamed city. While he was so engaged, letters came from Englclnd, that he impatiently opened the impationce; tbe first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; tbe others were of his guard, tbe they strangled him; if he had previously entered into the inta bis imagination that there was an evil power residing in his jurisdiction, they seemed to give sufficient bit reason for belief. His guardians irisisted on his immediately lcavlng his friend, arid admonished, that his charactor was terribly viciouf, because the possession of the irresistib1e powerf of seduction, makes his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that if contempt for adultery had not been born in the beating of his character; 6ut tbat he had demanded, for enbanoe hif gratification, that his victim, the associate of guilt, should be precipitated from the apogee of unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, that all the semals which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, from the beginning bis, launched evcn the mask asidc, arid had not scrupulously exposed all the dogma of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on leauing one, of which eharacter hod n0t nevertheless showed a point of brighl slrigle on whooh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning it completely, by seeking, in the sense, to make it more narrower, and not to allow light circumstances to pass. He clung into the circle of the sarcastics, and soon perceived, his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whom he was dating with joy. In Italy, it was rarely that a urimclied female was encountered in society; so he was obliged to wear his p1years in the dry land; but Aubrey's eye followed him all his windings, and soon discovered that an afsignation had been opposed, which would probably end in the ruin of the innocent girl, though insensitive. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked her for his incentives towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of the wait to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were such that he suppoved all would have on such an occasion; and after having been pressed if to be destined to marry him, simply laugh. Avbrey retllred; and, immediately shouting a note, to say, that from then on he must decljne accomponeing hif Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered fervent bis to look for other apartments, and calli on the other of the Icldy, he informed her all that he knew, not only as regards t0 his daughter, but a1so regarding the character of his Lordship. The assignment of the wcls prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to warn his complete afsenl to a separation; but did not mention any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by the interpositiori of Aubrey.\nOut of fear of Rome, Aubrcy headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; the lunatic clnd took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of ancient glory on manuments which apparently, shameful to tell the acts of freemeri only besieged the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as bimself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of failure in Mohammed's paradise, except that the eyes hor spoke too much spirit so that someone could belong to lhoose who had rio souls. As she danced on the p1ain, or tripped alo ng the sidc of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beouties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the Clnimal costumed 6ut to the taste of an epic. The light step of Ianthe often acoopanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would be the inconceivable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the beauty that is of hcr shape, floating as it wcre on the wind, to the greedy look of him, wbo forgotten the letters that he just deciphered on an almose erasure tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids fall, as she flittod around, expose in the ray of the sun sueh delicately briIliarit and quickly wipe out the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the same object ho had before thought of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passogus in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can tame?—It was inriocence, yauth and beauty, without the crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls having done so. As he drew these novels, which he wished to preserve in the coming hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencjl, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would describe the encirclement of the open plain, languish her, in all the brilliant colors of youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to have seen in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects which, obviously, had made a great impression on her mind, told her all the natural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she told, excited the euen inlerte of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampyro, who had spent years among her friends, and the dearest tie, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong hjs existnco during the erising months, her blood ran coid, while he tried to laugh out of such an idlc and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had at last dictated one living among the lhemfelves, after many of their parents and children reri had been found marked by the starry fantasy of his appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged for him to be, for he had been, roared, that those who scald to question their exisence, always had the same proof, that abjed thom had with the heart, that he had with the truth. Shc has detailed for him the traditional appearance...\nof these monsters, and his horror amplifies, hearing a rather crude description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, tal could not be truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that all tended to excite a belief in the supernatura1 power of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey began to linger more and moro to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had s0vght for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he mocked the idea of a young inanof English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more alienated to the form of an almose fairy before him. He was sometimes tearing himself apart, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he set out, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he found alwoys jt impossible lo fjx his attention on the ruins around him, while in his miride he kept the image cln that seesmod only legitimate tbe possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscient of love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was eoause she hod rio longer than a single wilh that she could visit her hants favorous, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragmorit wbich hod but esclps the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the Vampyref bone subjcct, and they b0tb, with severaI present, affirmed their existence, pclle with borror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make an excursion, whieh had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all both begged not to come back at night, os it must necessarily pclss through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, afler thc mcly had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They describod as the resort of thevampyres iri their night orgios, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on hlm who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw TBem fhudder at his audacity to mock in this way a lessorial power, whose very name apparently caused the blood to freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe his host's homolancholic face, and he was confounded to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, inhaled them badly with sucking soil. Wben he was about to leave, Ionthe carne on the side of the horse, and ardently begged him to return, the night was allowed the power of these beings lo be put into action;—hv promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that the horizon iri there was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, clnd pour all the rabies thoir on the devoted land.—Hc finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by spced for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is unknown aum0st; immediately the sun salts, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echoes lhunders had sealedly a resting interval — his thick heavy rairi forced his way through the ogc leaf cover, while the blue lightning fourkcd seemed to fall and radiate at his uery feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried by the dreadfvl speed in the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and it rose up, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel lhat barely high with masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to send him to the city, or at least to shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a silent moment, made him hear the terrible cries of a woman who was mingling at the dizziness, mocked with an exulting laugh h, continued with an almost intact sound; — they scattered themselves; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he made a sudden blow, forced the door at the opening of the cabin. He prostrated himself in darkness: sound, inclination, guided hjm. He was apparently not perceived, for although he was scattered, the findings continued, and nothing removed him. He came into contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out: \"Agclin baffled!\" He felt struck by 0ne whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell life bis as he could, he struggled; but it was ln voin: he was lifted from his feet tight with a huge force again the graunt: — his enomy fell on him, ond knecling hovering his chest, had placed his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating through the ball that gavc ljght in the day, he foiled him; — he stood up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, gripped in a moment the crash of the hranches, as he broke through the bourbier, was no longer beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incomparable to move, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, and the tufts fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on each straw with a heavy tote. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought who had attracted him to his crjes; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch burst again on hjm, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hopped that jt was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, when he set off the cm, strangled by his sjde. There was no colour on his cheek, not even vpon his lip; but tberc was a silence obsessed with his face which seemed almo st as much attcbbing as the life that the orice lived there: — on his neck and the brat was blood, and on his throat were the marks of a hedge opened the vein: — to this tob pointed men, criling, simultaneousoufIy sluck with horror, \"AVampyre! A vampire!\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who was much to him the object of so many straight and fair visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his kicks were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to flout the reflection, and the lake's refuge in the holiday, he almost unconsciously held in his hand a naked dagger of a particular oonstructiori, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon by different parties that had been engaged in the other's sea, which a mother had massacred. Their lamentable crying, while appr0achod the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their cries would be impossible; bvt when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid point ed lo Corsica. They were insolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these interva1s he went ca1l on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a coin he seemed to be begging his former companion of sparo the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and coveted him like his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, at this time arrivo al Athens, and, from the above motive, the ear of the stucco of Aubrey, immediately put hese1f in the same house, and became consonant bjs accompanying. When he recovered from his delirium, he horrified and stunned at the sight of him whose ho image had now been combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, involving almofl repentance for the tal fault had caused their separation, and even more so by the attion, the unxiety, and attention shown by ho, foon reconciled his presence. His seigneury seemed to have changed; it appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but, as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not pierce the difference of the former man, except that he was sometimes caught in encountering his stared gaze upon him, with a grim smile of exultation spreading over his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the Iast stage of the recovery of the Invaid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tidal wclues raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, tbe still sun;—in fact, he appeared to want to avoid the yes of a1l.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, has become much weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that he once had so dislingujshod now seems to have fled f0r ever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired him for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sows him in the midst of the ruins he had once frequented, the form of Iantho stood hy bis sjde — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the mod is vjolet; then suddenly, refreshing, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet mie on his lips. Ho decided to steal scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him wild by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, to visit these ports of Greek rieyet seen. They dragged in all directions, and sought every place to win; and they rushed from place to place, but they did not see what they were looking at. Tbcy heard a lot of poachers, but they gradually began these relationships, which they imagined as wero ony the invention of individuals, whose interest is to excite the generosity of those they defended against the dangers. As a result of this ncglecting thccldvico of the inhabitants, on an occosiori they have traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. However, at the enteriririg, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reason to repent of their nogligence; for there was hardly of the whole of the entré engaged in the narrow pass, when TBey were scattered hy the beating of bullets near their heels, and in relation to thethoecboed of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind rocks, had started firing in the Tbo direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement; but shameful to stand thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting shovels blae thern advance, and belng exasperated to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves had to climb above and take thom to the rear, they immediately decided to rvshavant in the sea of theeriemy. They had hardly thrown the shell of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which moved him to the ground. Aubrey hastenod t0 bis assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was quickly surprised by seeing the faces of the thieves the arund — his guards havin g, on the fact that Lord Ruthveri was wounded, immediately threw the arms of the thorium and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Auhrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after accepting upori o ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, simply keeping the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's training declined rapidly; in two dcly mortlfication was highlighted, and death seemed to advance the hasty steps. His eonducator and his appearance had not fainted; he seemed as painless as he had been the objects that surrounded him: 6ul towards the end of the last cuvée, his mind apparently became unoafy, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was unbelievable for his help with more usual bitterness—\"Assist ine! You can save me — you can do more than thal — I don't mean my life, I've listened to death as if my existence was not like that of the past day; but you can save my honor.\nUr, your friend's honor. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I denied, but first of all, my life flourished, I cannot explain everything, for yov would hide everything you know, if I had no spot in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I—but life. \"-\"We don't know him. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your fear, that for a year and a day you will not pass on your knowledge of my crimes or my death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see.\" \"The eyes seemed to burst out of their bases, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he ran down and laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\"\nAvbrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; the many circumstaneans clinging to this mori lifted up on his spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if it came from the presentation of some horrib1e waiting for him. Rjsing early in the morning, he was about to put on the roof in which he had left the body, when a thief met Hiin, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself drycomrods, after retreat bis, to the pinocle os a nearby mountain, according to a proinise that they had given his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of fir of the m0on thclt rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him on the place where Jt was lying. But when he had counted the top, he had no place to eitber the corpse or the clothes, the thieves swore that they were pointing at the identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in the corijectures, for he finally turned back, convinced that Thoy had buried the orpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently coincided to increase this superslitical melancholy which had saltzod on his mind, he resounded to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case of seueral weapons of offence, more or less acclaimed to ensure the death of the victim. There were scveral daggers and ataghons. As he turned to him, looking at the curious forins, which was his surprise to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastened to obtain more evidence, he found the weaving on, one imagined his rnay of horror wben that he discovered thal he was equivalent, although pecu1iarly shaped, the sheath that he had in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for a stealthy certainty: they seemed to look at 6th bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; hul the particular shape, the same variable shades on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were the cancer of the lady he had tried to pull out of Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune was wasted, and she had not been heard since her seigneury had been scattered. Aubrey's mirid collapsed under the horror so unshakeable; he was afraid that the lady of the Tbis would have a victim lo the deftroyer of Ianthe. He was morase and bounded; he put his only profession in a position to exhort the speed of the postilions, af if he would save the first wife of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a bree2e, who seemed obedient to his will, soon set him on the English shores; and he hastened to dwell as the fathers of hjs, and this one, for a mament, appeared to the losc, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If the sbe besore, by his infantile caresses, had spoiled his cup, naw that the wearan began to appear, the sbe was even more attachedjng as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won in front of her and applauded the rallies of the drawing room. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His eye has never been motionless by the levity of the mind. There was a melancho1y abovt charm that did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain wjthin feeling, which seemed to indicate a tough soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which stifles where a butterfly or a heart can attract – it was sedative and pensive. When alaria, his face never lightened by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed to his love bis, and went in his presence to forget lhofe gri efs She knows that he destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that the eyes of thofe,—that fao then played in the light of the own natius sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it was thought by the guardians ber that her presentation could be delayed until her brother's return from conlineent, when he could be his practitioner. It was now, therefore, resolved that the nexl salon, which was approaching rapidly, should be the time of its enliry in the \"abuse scene\". Auhrcy would have preferred to stay in the inanjon of his fathers, and fed vpon tbe inelancholy who dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strclngers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had wjtnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own procession to the protectoriori of his sister. And they came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which was announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — the living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxj0us to rest in the kingship's smile, rushed with thithcr. Aubrey was there with her sister. Let him stand at a corner near him.If he did not take into account the entanglement around him, he prided himself on the memory that the first tyranny he had seen was in that plain, he suddenly fell down by the arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded with the ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly opened your turn, fearing to see cl specetore thclt the blclst, when he saw, in a distanco liltle, the same flgure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered the society. He looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was obliged to take a friend's arm, and he abandoned a passage in the crowd, and he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and corrected the hisharides vpon his head,af if he feared that his thoughts were inflamed his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a draconian picture — the dagger — his oath. — He shook himself, he could not believe that it was possible — the ascent unleashed again! — He said that he had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It is impossible that it can be real — he determined, Thérèse, to ga agoln in society; for although he was aspired to ask for anxietyirig Lord Ruthven, the name hung up on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection af a matran, he retired to a recreation, and there gave her to her own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many were leaving, he woke up, and entered another room, his sister surrounded several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. He went forward, broke his arm, and, with a hurry, he forced it towards the street; and at the door he found sons hindered by the crowd of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again that voice murmured the closet to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, soon came to the horn.\nAubrey became the most distracted. If, before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely was he absorbed, now the firmness of this monster's life leaned again upon his thoughts. Her sisler's attentions were now vnheed, and it was in vain that she intrigued him to explain to her wbat had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath slew him;—was it then to allow this fool to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he loved, did he not resist his progress? His sister could be touched by the hiin. But even if he broke his oath, and disappointed his svspicions, who would believe him? He laughed at using his own hand to free the world from such a wrctch; but his teeth, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; he shook in his room, he saw no one, and he went only when his sister cclme, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his good, to support the riature. Finally, unable to carry silt and solitudo, he left his house, wandered from street to street, astonished to steal this haunted image of hiin. His dress spoiled, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon smile as to the midnight humidity. He was no longer recognized; at first he returned to the house in the evening; but at 1st he put him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His slster, anxiovs for his safety, employed people to sprinkle him; but they were soon djstagnant by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His oonduc, howeuer, has slightly changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence all his sricnds, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enlist again in society, and to watch him closely, anxious to renounce, in spjte of oath of hjs, all that Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his eyes of hook and suspense were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to refrain from masturbating, for God's sake, a soeiety that after-\nI saw him so loud. However, when the remorse proved to be unwavering, the guards thought there was a true lriterpose, and fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was high time to regain a trust in gain that had been imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nTo save him from the suffering that he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they were insanity, they hired a physicicile to return to the house, and take care of him. Ho hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by an earthly subject. His incoherence became the last so great, that he was confined to his room. There he often lied for days, inexhaustible from awake 6ejng. Hc had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a vitreous chandelier; — the only sign of affection and reminder left displayed sonclf at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with the appearances of thy severe lyaffllcted her, ho misunderstood her not to touch the hive. \"Ob, don't let him down, if your love for me is clumsy, don't care!\" But when she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"Truth! lrue!\" And again he sank in a state, even though she couldn't wake him up. The months last: little by little, as the year passed, his iricoherences bocage less often, and his mind shuddered a part of his morosity, while his guardians 6scrved, than several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of the bis guards entering his room, began to converse with his hysioian about the melancholic circumstance of the bei ng of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Immediately Auhrey's intention was drawn; he was anxiously asking whom. Glode of this return mark of the intellect, whose thy fear that he had been deprived, tbey deserved the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed astonished, and astonished TBem ftll1 again by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They harassed Nat, but in a few minutes his sjster was with him. Hc was apparently agony able to be affected by the insluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thalbt of her brother's being more alive to the feelings of afaction. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accomplished; when he suddenly picturing a l0cket on his breasl; openjng it, which was bis surprised to bomb the features of the monster who had had if lang influenced his life. He captured his portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled him foot vnder. She asked him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, that he would remove him as if he did not understand her, while he grasped his hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of face, he made him swear that she would marry him, for he—but he could not accommodate—he again became inflamed as he was rot voioe gave him his oath—he turned suddenly, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but did not ignite. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who heard everything, and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and for...\nHe fired her from Miss Aubrey, fired her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and began to wait, but one day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined having seized his mind, wanted to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the show, and had been reused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he did not begin to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered an insanity, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, ond, by the constant presence, and lhc prctence os great affection for the other br and interest for his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. What could resist his power? His language had dangers and a toll to tell—could speak of himself as an individual with a rio-syinpathy with any peak on the crowded earth, except with hor to whom he addressed himself;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing aocents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use Serpenl's art, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his career. The title of the older branch fell long to hjm, he obtained an irritating erbassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the mclrrage, (in spite of his brother's disturbed balance,) which took place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to tinker with the servants, but in the vajn. Ho asked for a pen and paper; he slipped it; he wrote a letter t0 his sister, conjuring her, as sbe valued her own happiness, hcr his honor, and the honor of thossc now jn the grave, which once held her in arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay but f0r a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the most heclvy curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, tho ravingf of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied irimates of the hause; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be conceived more easily than described, the n0tes of preparation 6usy. Camo in the morning, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servans takes hold of their vigilanoe, they gradually fly away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a related was out of the room, and in a moment ring himself in the apartment where all werc almost assemb1ed. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the hive: he immediately appropriated himself, and, taking his arm by force, shook him from the room, without a voice with fury. On the stairs Lord Rutbven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if my 6ride in the day by day, your sister is dishonored. Womori are fragile!\" He pushed him to his servants, who, by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his brother nat, who had found the aeration, had broken a vesicle of blood, and he was carried to bed. This misfortune was not mentioned to his sister, that he was not present when he entered, as the doctor was in the throes of agitatig her. The marriage sown, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of near death. He desired his sister's guardians, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated: he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but Wben Thoy arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvlhven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nL0RD BYRON RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world afflicts her all, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence its guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, one of the ships of his Majesly, in the year 1882, we rushed into the harbour of Mitylenc, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi of cattlo and vegetables to be there, bring many British ships to the vlsit—warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way f0r bound ships t0 Smyrna, its premiums pay amply for tho deviation or a voyage. We landed, af usval, at the base of the bay, and while the men were employed in the watering, and the pure trading for the cattle wlth the natives, the arid clergy myself took a ramble lo tho cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been befaro. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come for Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before arriving1 in his felucoa. \"He raised me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he would have given me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am probably Get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The c0ttage above the hill, facing the river, bclongf at bim, and he left an old man in charge 0f it: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zécheries sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and lived there about fourteen months, but not constclntly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the various islands.\"\nThis story excited our euriasity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening from the house where our covntryman had retired. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to them. It consists of four apartmentsf on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a bathroom, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: pl ain of the walls of the groin, tclble marble on each side, a myrtle barley in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play your through the branches by rnovirig a spririg fixed on the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed furniture. In the room stood an English half-cabin doz eri, and an empty baok-case: there were no mirrors or singing points1. The bedroom had more a large mattress lying on the floor in a tbe, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed marble reefs, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers,whlch were then in a large box of soaman in the closet: it was open, but we rioted thirik ourselves justified in the examination of the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roufseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Rvinsof Einpires by Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah by Klopstock; the novels by Kotzebue; the play by Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise by Milton Lost, an Italian editorialist, given to Parma in I810; and the small pamphlets fram the Grcek press in Constantinop1e, much torn, but no English book 0f no description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord read these books before he left, and forgot to place Thomas with others; but, he said, they must remain there until his return; for it is so special, that if I sent one thing without orders, he would float on me for a week together; there are many others. One day I made him a fervour; and I have the prodvce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty Zecbins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small oo tclge in the wood, and that Lord Brugbt here of Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of wbat.\"\nThe Tbe appearance of the house Tbe was extremely pleasant. The portico at the front was long fistious steps and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marblc canned with black pliths and fret work cornices, (as it is now eustomary iri Grocian architecture,) wcre considerably hlgher than the roof. Ro0f, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a sinus turkey carpot, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, for the Greeks spend the evenings smoking, light wines bugirig, such as af \"lachryrna christ i\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little strcamlet glided, rapes, hedges and limbs intertwined on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrlle, a marble seat with a back made of wood of ornamerita1 was placed, as we are told, the lord spent mony after his arid evenings until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and tacking. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed because he was Uery Dcvovt, and that he was always present in our time twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to MovntCalcla, covered oliue wjth and myrtle trees in bloom, and ori the svmmit including an ancient Greek temple appeared majestic iri rot. A small streumassif from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the slats near the Mau-\nRitain's base. The smooth sea as glass, and a colourless horizon by a single cloud, terrinates the victim in front; and a little to the left, through a ujsto of 1ofty chesnut and palm trees, several small if lands were observed distinctly, spreading the wavy light blue with groen emerald bone spots. I rarely enjoyed a morc view that I did not do tbis; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his riame but Dominick, hjs banker, who had g0neto Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could he say, hut I'm sure I won't be,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, 6ut on our return to the basn we learned several details of the secluded lord. He had worn eight young girls when hc was lasl on the island, and had even danced with them at feasl nuptiol. He gave an eel to a man, orfees to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman Wbo lost bis own iri a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor cbildren. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, to have beeri a very eccentric and benevolcntcharacter. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage does not have the right to reveal. He had a very bcautifvI daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walkirig on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a piano-strong, and taught him himself the usc of it.\nSvch was the jnformation with the whilch that we left from the peaceful is1e os Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, warfsing that rambling to Greeoe could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philanlhropy of disposition, arid all these eocricitjes whjch brand ecumenical genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the bow, a student of WYATT'S, who had truffled in Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual, he said, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byran; I rnet bim in rny travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of hjs Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calc1a in the eurey page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our research at lhe cottag c, 6ut we comforted with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a certain future mcly; but at my hat day rievcr return. I oppose it, believing that he is not interesting, and in court in the name of his seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with the human community, ar contributing arduously to foot pain, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be plairily collected from these small anecdoles. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly detected in the pooms of his seigneury, secm to have their seat in the bosom hjs. The tenderness, sympathizers and charity seem to guide his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is a strange reason to mark him as a being on which the religion of art has affixed its seal, and ovor whose head Volunteer has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"rails\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his Ioves or his pleas, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed again towards the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself admits that the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a death-tracking. The character of Lord Byron is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and to avoid applause from the wor1d, Is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approval of canscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prlnter, Crown caurt, Fleet Street.",
    "18": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon that this story is founded is very general in the Eclst. Among the Arabs it seems common lobe: he did not, however, externalize himself to the united Greeks after the estalishinent of Cbristianity; and he did not take his present form end the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt so burjod on their territory, he increased graduated, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and the bavtivel. In the West, it explodes, with a slight variation, throughout Hungory, Polarid, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the 6elief existed, that vampyres night imbibcd a cert-\nA part of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of erosumplions; while these fattened human blood-svckers — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to causo the blood to flow srom all passages of jr bodics, and evori of the poref even of the skins of lhcir.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious, and of course credible aocount of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvngary. After an examination of the commander in the ohief and rna grates of the place, they declared positively and unanimously that about five years assior e, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had beeri heord to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he was tormented by a vainepyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the orth of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days clout his death and sixth, many people complain of having been tormented by the hive, and a deposition was made, tbat four persoris were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Since the evidence was thus obtained, Thcy used the aecuflomed remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where ho is reporter for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. This d0ne, this thoy cut off the bis's head, put his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The sclme measurements were adopted with the tbose corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, 1est thoy should, in turn, become agents on olhers which survived the ème cm.\nUniversal belief is, tbat a person sucked by a vampyre bccorns a vampyre hirnsclf, and sucks in its turn.\nChief baillff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems to bet adapted to illustrate the subjecl of prosent observations than any other inftanee that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of death aster punishment, for a heinous crime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but copulated to limit his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved the moss while he up0n earth – he was bourid by ties of kinship and affliction.—A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first upon the ear, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus fhail of his back shall be praised; and then haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, in the midst of the stream of Iife; yet forget the banquet that persecutes shall feed thy livid living corsus, victims of Tby, they shall still expire, are known the devil for their sire; as ye cursed, ye cursed them, thy flowers shall be inlaid upon the stem. But it is the crime that must fall, The youngest, the best flouted of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! You will put an end to your task and you will mark the last tint of his cheok, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must be blown out Who freezes o'er they without blue life; Then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in ljfe o lock when horn The pledge of fondost Trouble has been worn—But riow is carried away from you Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinchy tooth, and your hamburger 1ip; and then harass yourselves on your tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror depart from the cursed spectre of them.\nMr. Southey also presented iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampyre 0f the young girl of Arabion Oneiza, who is presented as having rumbled from the grave with the aim of torching him that she loved better during her existence. But if it cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of her life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity clnd innocence. Tbe veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishjng cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calrnet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradjtionary riarrativcs illustrating his effects, hos put fortb some dissertations learned, tends to praver him as a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this dreadful superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limils tbe of a note, riecessively dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be conlued by simple remark, that tbough the term Vampyre is that in most of the Gerrieral acceptances, there are several other synonyms wjth it, mclde use of in the variaus parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that in the midst of the accompanying dissipations on a winter in Londori, a nobleman, more remarkable for his sjngvlarities, appeared to the vclrieux of the chiefs of the ton, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted its attention, so that it could by a glance calm it, and throw fear into those breasts whenc tboughtless rcjgncd. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explate from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works your heart's tho; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead weighed on the skin it could not pass. His curiosities invited him into all the houses; all wanted to see Hiin, and those who were ill-used by the excitement and weight of boredom were having fun raising something in their presence, capable of attracting their attention. In spite of the tint of her shell, which never gained a warmer tint, nor of the buffoon of modesty, nor of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours were tiring, many female hunters, after notoriety, began to gain his attention, and won, at least, some marks of what they might call the afsection: Lady Mercer, who was tho mockery of every monster worn in drawing-rooms Sirice her mcliage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but pvt on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his attention:—although in vain:—when she passed before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, he was still as if thoy were not perceived;—evcn ber uriclppalled impudence was bleak, and she left the field. But although commrnori adultery can never influence the direction of his eyes, it is not the female sex that is indifferent to him: yet it is the apparent caution with which he speaks to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that fcw knows that he addresses himself to the foetals. He had, commenting, the reputation of a winning language; and even if it was that he overcame the fear of flrigular bis c haractère, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatrod of vice, he was also often omong those women who boast about their fex of their domestic virtues, as among the thofes who shovel her by their vices.\nAbout the same thing, Thore came to London a young gentleman from Aubrey's riam: he was an orphan on the left with only one sister in the great wealth of the possessfiori, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important burden of his mind to the care of the suba1ternf mercenary, he cultivated his imogiry more than his judgment. He therefore had this high feeling of honor and frankness, which ruines every day so many fears of mjl1iners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice lhat was thrown by Providennc only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the Romans: he thought that misery 0s a cottage was merely constituted by the ve sting of clothes, which were af hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by the irogular jr folded on various colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the virtues of life. He was beautiful, frowned and rich: for these reasons, upori his entry into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing favourites or romirig: tho daugbters at the same time, by their brilliant faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his tales and hjs laughed at me. Attached as he wos to the rannance of his folitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the tcl1low and wax candles that sparkle, not of the presencc of o ghost, but of the lack of snufflng, therc was not fovndation jn real life for any bone that congerics pleasant images and descriptions contain in the volumes of thosc, from which he had formed his study. However, finding the same complement in his pardoned vanjty, hc was about to give up his dreams, when the extra0djnaryster we described abovo, met him in hls clreer.\nHe struck him; he grasped the impossibility even of an idea of haracler of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacjt consent to their existence, imp-\nlie by the avoidance of their conlact: allowing his imagination to imagine too lhirig who flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this objoct in the hero of a romance, and to observe the offspring of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He acquired himself with him, paid him attentioris, and so far, in his opinion, advanced that his presence was always recognized. He learned that Lord Ruthveri's asfairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was on the journey. Desiring to give some information about this singular chclracter, which, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to execute the tovr, which many generations was necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of skill they have had to make them stand out. They consented: and Aubrey immcdiateIy mcntioning his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such an o mark of esteem srom him, who, apparently, had not iri comrnon with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had pasfed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrcy had not had the opportunity to study the harassment of Lord Ruthven, and n0w found, that, th0ugh much more of his actors have been expounded to his uiew, the results have offered different conclusions of the apparent reasons for his conduct. His appearance was profuse in his liberality; — the idle wanderer, and the beggar, roused with his hand rhorreth that enough to deliver their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he launched his alms; - these were sent fram tbe door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask s0mething, not to sniff out his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink hjm always decept in his iniquity, he wcls sent far with rich cabarity. However, this was attributed to the greater import of the victim.\necumenical, which predominates gonerally over the absenteeism of virtuous indigents. There was an inconsistency about the charjly of her Lordship, which was ftll more impressed on her mind: al1 those on wh0m it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scoffo1d, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufsels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised to appear eagerly with whoh his compani0n sought centres of sor tbe vice-sashionable; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: to be be wagered, and aIways grenbled successfully, except where he knew sharper was his antaganist, and lhen lost bc evcn more than he gcliné; but it was always with the same immutable face, with whom erally looked the arorid society: He was not, however, when he encries against the young novician eruption, or the father without chance of an enumerous family; then his very desire seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction applause of the wcls spirit set aside, and the eyes sparkled with more fire than the cat's beat with the half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the wildly rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drowned him inside the cockroach of this fiendre; WHjlst mony a father sat fronlic, in the midst of the eyes talking of silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his immcnse wealth lotie, where to buy even enough to seal their present desire. But he did not take a nanny from the gamble table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of the Inany, he had just pulled the last gjlder from the convulsive catch of the Innocent: this mjght but was the result of a certain degree of kriowledge, which was not, however, capahle as fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often seized himself to represent this in his sling, he implored him to rebuke this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not yield to his own proflt; — but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and ope n1y to him; hawever, this never happens. Lord Ruth uen in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and lbaugh Aubrey was near the object of historiosity, he obtained no grafting gratification of him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break that mysteria, wbich to his exalted immagjnatiori began to assume the appearance of supernatural bleeding.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; be the lefl in daily presence on the mornirig circle of a Countess of Italiliclri, while he went in search of the rnemorials of clnother almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, the lettenders came from Englari, which he opened with impatience; the sirst came from his sister, bowing to nothing but affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he entered into his imagination that there was bad power in his composition, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his friend immediately Ieaving bis, and urgcd, that his umbilicator was terribly vicious, because the possession of irrosistjble p0wers of seduction, made his licentiouf habits more dangarous to sociate. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born of the hatred of his character; but he demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the associate of his vilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of unconscionable virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the accustomed of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not rescued to expose all the dcformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvbrey determined upan leaving the one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the tbe eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for completely abandoning the bim, purposing, in the rnean during, to monitor it more closely, and not to let pass any slight circonnetonce without attention. He inherited in the same circle, and soori perceived, that his Lordship endeavoured to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the 1ady, whose mainly home he frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried family is met wjtb in society; so he wcls obliged to wear his peans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in oll his windings, and soon discovered that an assignatiori had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an incredulous girl, th0ugh tugbt. Having no time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and he constantly asked Hiin for her intentions with respect, insorning hlm at the same time that he knew that he was meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were veiled, as he believed, and that he would have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry, if he had\nHe wanted to marry her, he just laughed. Aubrey retired; and as soon as he began to attack a child, he said that from that moment on he should refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rendition of their proposed day, he commanded his servant to seek other partmonts, and called the mother of the lady, informed of all that he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of her Lordshjp. The assignment prevailed. Lord Ruthven riext day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a seplation; but the riot implied any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Avbrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Romc, Aubrey led his steps towards Greece, and passed through\nOn the peninsula, he quickly found himself in Athens. He soon took care of himself in the tracirig the archives of ancient glory which, apparently, were ashamed to chronicle the act of the free men only before the slaves, had said to themselves 6enath tbe sheltering the ground or many licheris. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a look, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have f0rmed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the hope promised by faith in Mohammed's paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much for anyone you thought that she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on lhe plajn, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, however, one would have the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the suitable animal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe has often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities of the apnea, arid ofton would be the unconscious glrl, engaged in the pureujt of a bulterfly koshrnere, showing all the beauty of the shape of the ber, floating as it was on the wind, lo tbe staring greedy of him, who forgiven the milkcrs that he came from deciphcred on a tclblet almost erased, in contemplation of his figure sy1ph-likc. Often, her lresses fell, os she flirted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and sadistic1y sadistic shades, he might well excuse the sorghetness of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the hc very object had been thought of by the vital importer to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the harms that all the senses, but none can appreciate?—It was insanity, youth and beauty, without it being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew the remains of lh0se, he wanted to keep a memorial for his hovrs fvture, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of the horative; she would then describe to him the dclnce rotating on the open plain, painted, to him in a11 the brilliant colors of the youtbful mororiory, the wedding sbe remembered having looked into his infarction; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impressionist on his mind, told him all the pennies of his nurse. And often as she told her the story of the ljuant vampy, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and slept tief, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful femcllo to prolong her exjslence during the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at it from so many idle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe quoted to her the old men, who had detected in Lasl one living among the lhemselves, after several of their close relatives and chjldrens had been found marked with the seal of the fiend's appetite; and wben sbe found so unbelievable, she begged to believe it, for he had been, pointed out, that those who hcld darod to question their existence, had always had giuen evidence, which forced him to confess, with grief and heart broken, to confess. She details to prevent the traditional appearance of the TBese monsters, orid her horror was increased, by the pillowrig a pretty descriptioni0n of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could not be truth iri her fears, at the same time he marveled at the many coincidences that hcld all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural heathen of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey begged more and more to Ianthe; his innocenone, so contrasted with all the affeoled virtues of the women among whom he had saaught sow his visjon of romance, won his heart; ond whie he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hospitals, boring ari an educated Greek girl, slill he found himself moro and inore attached to the almost magical form to lull him. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiqvarianrefearch, he was going away, discouraged from not returning until his object was reached; but he always had the impossibility to fix bisatlentlon on the ruins around him, who was in his mind, he kept a thal imclge seemed alone the rigid possessor of his lhovghts. Ianthe was not conscious of his love, and wcls never the infantile frank sclme that he had first kn0wn. She always felt repulsive of him, but it was because she had no one left that she could visit her favorite fantasies, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that she had still shaken the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to the parents of lo hor on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, confirmed their existence, pale of horror to this very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to take one of his excursions, which held him for a few hours; when he heard the name of the place, he begged him once not to come back at night, for he had to pass through a wood, without Grcek ever remaining, after the closing of the day, on any regardatjon. Tbey described it as the resort of the vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and gave the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path. Aubrey ranade light of the representatives of the Jr, and tried to laugh at them ul of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at the bis dared thvs to mock a picterio, lnfernal power, the very name of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next day, Mornirig Aubrey set out on his unattended tour; he was surprised to observe the mclanchole face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, misled them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and urged him to return. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the day-libt was about to end, and that on the horizon there were some of these spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gathered jnto a mass of tremendaus, and povre all their rage on the devoted amount.—He finally mounted his horse, however, determined to catch up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these outcasts, is almost unknown; I have shortly after sunset, the neighborhood begins: and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was abov o—his exuberant thunders had barely a resting interval—its thick languishing rain forced its way to beat the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he carried with dreadfvl quickly through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the nejghbourbood of a hovel that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves of dry brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he learned, hoping to find one to guide the back of the city, or at least trust to get a shelter from the pool of the star. As he approached, the thunders, because they were silent, allowed him to hear the terrible shouts of a wombln that mixed with the stifled stuffing, exulting with a laugh, conlinuating in goose almost without noise;—he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: sound, moaning, guided him. It was apparently not perceived; f0r, although he had stalled, the sounds continued, and no no nolice was taken from him. He found himself in the eontact with somc 0ne, which he immediately faked; when a voice cried out: \"Again gagged!\" to which a loud laugh continued; and he flanked him whose strength seemed superhuman: defied to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but he waved in vain: he was lifted from his feet and was struck by the unalarmed force against the ground: — his enemy dragged himself over him, and began to tremble on his bush, had put his hands on his throat — when he shook the glare of inany t0rehes penetrating through the hole that gavc ighl in tho doy, disturbed him; — he rose instantly, and, throwing his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mother the crash of the branches, as the tbe wood was broken, was no longer the beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on the individual straw of ury with soot flakes. At Avbrey's desire, they sought out his whom had attracted him by his cries; ho was agaln left in the darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torbes once mare burst upon him, to perceive the alry form of his beautiful conductor brought in the lifeless Corsica. He closed his eyes, hopjng that it was only a vision derived from his imagination of djsturbod; but to be again seen the same form, when he closed them, extended to his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even a ber lip; but there was a silence on his face that attaches almost as well as life as the orice lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and upori his throat was the marks 0f teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, sluggishly struck horror, \"A Vampyre! o Vampyre!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside the ber who had recently asked him for so many brilliant and magical visions, now flanked by the f1ower-bone life that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was benvmbed and seemed to run away from the search, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he said alinost without consceleration jn hjs hand a naked dagger from a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search for his wboma mothcr had rnisscd. Sad screams, as they learned, told the parents a terrible disaster. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they saw the oause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and punched with the corse.\" They were inconsolable; 6oth died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was 0ften delirium; in these intervals he could call Lord Ruthven and upori Ianthe — by some combinati nable he seemed to be beg of his former eophan to spare the being he loved. At other times, he impregnated maldictions on his head, and we were as his doster. L0rd Ruthven, chanoé at the time of the tbis to arrive in Athens, and, of any inotiue, listening to the state 0f Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and bocame his oonslant wait. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and fertrified by the sight of him whose image he had read by painting that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault which had caused their solatation, and even more by the attrition, anxiety, and caro which he showed, soori reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he appeared only an apathetic behavior that had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the foreign man, except that at tlmes he was surprised to meet his staring staring at him, with a grin of evil exultation plclying on his lips: he did not know wby, but this smjle haunted him. In fact, Lord Ruthven became apprehensive in the waves of watchirig and tidal waves raised by the breeze of the invalid, which marked the progress of these orbs, which revolved around the world of the ovary, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the cyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat elasticity of the mind that had once distinguished him so distinguished now seen t0 hove fled forever. Today he was as much an Iover af solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; bvt mueh that he fought for solitude, his mind could not find him in the nelghbourhood os Atbens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had previously sequenced, the forms of Iclntbe beside him — if he sought him in the woods, his step would wander in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; lheri sudden tuming tour, would show, to his wild imagination, his face pae and his wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, whose fealure created so bitter associations in his mjnd. He proposed to Lord Rvthve n, to whom he was bound by the care he had takon of him during his jllness, to visit these parts of Greece and had not yet split. They travel in all directions, and fight every place to remember what they could see; but while they hasten from one point to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. Thcy heard a lot of thieves, but they graduated bogan lightly these reports, whieh they imagined that they were the invention of individuals, whose intrigue it was to excite the generation of those they defended-\nIt's about supposed dangers. As a result, only once did they travel with a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. As they entered, however, a narrow dcfile, whose bottom was the 6th of a torrent, with large masses of rocks dug down from the nearby precipices, they hcld reclson to repaint their negligence; for they were hardly those who engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised tbo whistle of 6ulllels near their hoofs, and by thc echoes the report of several guris. In a moment, the guards of Tbeir had left them, and, placing themselves with bchind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report of Tbe came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shouting their advarice, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should go up above and take them back, they immediately decided to rush forward into the witchcraft of the time. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bot in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his peril, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wound, immediately struck his arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reformulation, Avbrey soon encouraged him to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; arid havirig agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their president — they were happy to keep the entrance until their eomrade returned with the promised lbe sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's rapid effort has diminished; in two days death has followed, and death has climbed in motion with rapid steps. His arid behavior had not ehangod; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects about him: hut towards the end of the last ev ent, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced to 0ffer his help with more than the usual seriousness—\"Help me! You can save me — you can do more than tbat — I don't mean my life, I've heard death if my existence is as small as that of the passing day; but you can save my horror, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do any lhing,\" said Avbrey.\"I need a little space, I can't say what there is, but if you know me, my honovre was a free spot in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time to Englari—I—I—Ijfe. \"—\"He will not be known. \"\"Swcar!\" cried the dying man, raising him with exulting violence, \"I swear to you that by all your nature you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or your dates to any living being in any way whatsoever, what will happen, or what you will see. \"His eye seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing at his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but fell asleep, and the many circumstantials who were present at his knowledge, this man arose upon his spirit, and did not know why; and when he remembered his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, as if it came from the presupposition of something horrible awaiting him. He got up early in the morning, he fought to enter the hovcl in wbicb he had left the corpse, queried an inet hirn thief, and irritated him that he was not changing there, after having been conned by himself arid comrcldes, upori his retreat, at the pinccle of a nearby mountain, accord-\nThey promised that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took the men's seueral, determined to bury him on the place where he was. But when he was mung at the summit, he put neither the corpse nor the clothes in traco, and the Ro6bors swore that they reported the identicol rock on which they had laid lhe hody. For some time, the bis spirit was perplexed in the res conjeetu, but he finally re-wrote, convinced that they had buried the orpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, set in which all apparently conspired to hcight in this superstitlous melancholy that bad seized on his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Olranto or Naples, he himself accuses himself of organizing these effects which he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing scvera1 weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of Uictim. There were several daggers and ataghans. As he transformed them and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise to stage a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastening to go further, he found the weapon of Tobe, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was dressing there, the sheath of Tbe of special shape, which he held in his heel. His eyes did not seem to need a certain certainty — they would shake their eyes to be bound to the dagger; however, until he wanted to unravel; but the pcltricular form, the same varied teddy on the arid sheath had been similar in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eaoh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his fir incursions concerned the lady whom he had tried to snatch Lord Ruthven's seductive arls. Her parents were in distress, the fortune was wasted, she had not known since the seigneury's departure. The miride of Aubrey becclme alm0st broken under so many repeated horrors; feared that the lady tbis had been victimized by the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose arid silent; and his only oonisted oecuation in urglng the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to savow the ljf of the suine which he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swayed him on the English coasts; ond he hastened the home of his fathers, and there, for a mountain, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of the sister hjs, all memory of the past. If previously, by her inntin motorists, had gained her affection, now that the Wombln was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winnjng grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon femblies. There was none of this bright lightwhieh exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded partent. His blue cye has never been illuminated by the softness of the miride wicker. There was a melancho-\nthe sacred charm of this one that did not seem to emerge from misfortune, but from some wlthin feeling, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not tbal light foot, which goes astray where a butterfly or a collar can attract—he was sedate and pensive. Wben alone, her face was never shaken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would iri her presence fargel those sorrows that she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smilo f0r that of voluptuclry? He shook as if thososos eyes,—thal tace then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had been ready to the world, he thought bcen 6y ber gvardians more appropriate that his presentation should be delayed until the relvrn of his brother of eontinent, who he mjghl bo his protector. It was now, Thérèse, resolved that the next drawing room, which was approaching quickly, should be the era of inheritance in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and fed on the melancholy that supplanted him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so strong by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own consolation to the protection of his sister. They soon went to the city, and prepared for the day noxt, which had been made like a drawer room.\nThe crowd was in excess — a living room had not been held for a long bed, and all the wh0s were eager to get into the smi le of royalty, bclstenedthither. Aubrey was there with her sister. Whjle stood in a comer near him, without taking into account all around him, committing himself to the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a volce that he recognized too well, sovnded in his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He had hesitated to turn, fearing to see a fpeetre that would explode him, when he perceived, a little far away, the stern figure that had drawn his attention to this place vpon his first entry into society. He looked until his members were the most numerous to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to force a passage through the crowd, ho threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, ond fixed his hands vpon his hcad, as if he feared that his thoughts would brow from his brain. Lord Ruthuen agaln begged him — the circumstances began to open — the dagger — his oath. — He woke him up, he might riot that it was possible —\n—the dead rise again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which the spirit rests. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; sor thovgh he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could riots managed to win insormalization. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a malrori, he removed irit0 a pause, and there gave himself to his own thoughts of wandering. Finally, seeing that many weroes were leaving, he woke up and entered the enclosure, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he ottemplated to pass and approached her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these traits that he was most atrocious. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her towards the artery: it was the d0 or he sounded himself hindered by the crowd of servants who were waiting for the Siberian lords; arid while hc was committed to passing them, he heard this voice whispering near him — \"Remember your oath!\" — He dared not turn around, but, in a hurry to his sister, soon arrived at home.\nAubrey became very distracted. Is before his mjnd was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now thal the certainty of the living agony of monsler pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was to Uain that she insulted him to explain to him what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His starry oath bim; —wow then to allow this moribund to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not on his progress? Hjs very sister was touched by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would have 6elieve hlm? He thought of using his skilful hand to free the fram world such a wretched; but declth, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes flowing with tears, the work, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear the stillnoss and solitvde, for fear that his house, wanders the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and hc wanders, bone often exposed at midday as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; but finally he placed it at dawn to rest whenover faligue orert took it. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but he who fled from a pursuer was soon dislodged. Driving, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea of tal being theft by his absencc all his sricnds, with a fiend among them, bones whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, set up watching him cl0sely, anxious to predict, despite his oats, all that Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a trail, his distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sistcr wos al Iast forced him to refrain from weakening, for his sok, a society that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the Guclrdians took hold of the interposition, and fearing that his mind would lighten, they thought it was high time to take over the trvft that had been imposed upon them before by Aubrey'f parentf.\nDesiring to save the hiin from the irijuria and the sufferings he had daily bewitched in his wanderings, and to protect him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they uttered madness, they engulfed a doctor to reside in the house, and the lake constclnate care for him. He seemed to notice it with ardour, if completely his mind was absorbed from a lrrible subject. His incoherence became the last so great, that he was confused with his cbam-\nThat's right. He often lied there for days, incapable of being awakened. He was compressing badly, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and rccollection that remained appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing hands, glances that afflicted him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"0h, don't touch him, if your love for me is alive, don't approach him!\" When, beyond that, she asked whom he was reciting, her only answer was: \"Truly! True!\" And agajn he sank Irito a state, from which it was not evcn sbe coû1d that woke him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was passiririg, its inconsistency became less frequent, and its mlnd threw a part of its morosity, which its guardiaris observed, that several timos in the day he was going to punch on his fingers a certain number, then srnilo.\nThe bad weather almost passed, when, in the last month of the year, onc of his guardians engulfing his room, began to coriver with his doctor upori the melanoholy circvmstance os Aubrey being in such a terrible siluation, when his sister was gorig ncxt day to get married. Immediately, Avbrey's attractiveness attracted himself; he was hovering towards whom. Happy with this brand af returning intellect, from wbich they seared it had private bcen, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsdon. Thinking that he was a count y0vng with whom he had rnet in society, Aubrey a somed plaids ed, and aftonished them even more by expressing his intention lo to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They responded to the riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brevity, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the spirit of his brother once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to gather his upori his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and each accomplishing; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; the opening he, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who had so long influenced his face. He captures the portrait in a paroxysine of rage, and the pietina under his feet. Upori hor asked him why he thus created the resemblance of his future Husbclnd, he looked as if he had not underestimated it — then by taking hold of his Hor hands, and observing it with a frenetic expressiori of countermeasures, he told him to swear that she would never marry that Monfter, for he—but he could not advclnce—it seemed as if this voice clgain bye hiin remembered his oath—he turned fuddenly around, thinking that Lord Rulhven was near him bvt faw person. Meanwhile, the guards of the physiciari, who had heard everything, and who thought it was only a reminder of his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, desired out of him. He kneeled down to them, he begged, he begged for them, but one day sor. They attributed this to the madness they imagined had taken possession of the spirit, had the opportunity to pacify it, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called tbe inornjng after the draw, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood it; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his arid pleasure was hardly hidden from those among whom he had obtained this information. Ho hastened to the house if his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great affection for the 6rother and the interest Iri his destiny, hc gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers that could be told: Bimsels were spoken of as an individual who had no sympathy with any bolng ari, the crowded ear, save wjth she to whom he addressed himself bimsels;—could say how, since he had kriew, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preseuration, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing appeasements;—in the end, know so well how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the long-term elder branch falljng to him, he kept an iinportant embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his deportation to the continent.\nAubrcy, when he was left by the doctor and his guardians, lingered to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked sor pon and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, encircling her, as she valued her own hclppness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for a few hours this marriage, on the whip, he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but when he gave him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to mess up Miss Aubrey's spirit by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night stopped without rest at the house of the occupied prisoners; and Aubrey heard, with horror, perhaps more easily conceive himself than described, the notes of preparation well filled. The morning came, arid the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilanco, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the custody of an old ari impotent woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and in a moment found luise1f in the opartent where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the proud one to perceive hjm: he approached immodestly, and, taking his arm by the advance, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. When ori tho staircase, Lard Ruthven murmured the ear jn bis—\"Remember your oath, and kriow, except for my fiancée by day, your sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his entourage, which, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could not support himself 1onger hiinself; rabies not finding ventilation, had broken a bladder of blood, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his slsler, who was not present when hc entered, as the doctor feared to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and to be married and married 1stft London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; blood effvsion produces tbe neclr appraach symlomas of death. He wanted the guards of his sisler to be called, and that an hour of midnight had been beaten, he would tell in a composite way what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven disapproved badly, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was hel beforo him, where to choose his place af rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nSeeing through the Greek Archbishop, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in Ycar 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this pl acc, and the supply of cortains of rattles and Uegetables to be had tbere, bring many British ships to Uisit—both men of war and merchant merci; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its blounios oinply reimburse for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed to water, and the sacriller was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the clergy and I took a ramb to the cave called Homer's School, and other piacef, where we had been boforc. On the front of Mount Ida (a small moriticle so named) we met and hired a young Groek os our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island the days before our arrival at bis Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I n0t chose qvlt Mitylene, where I am like a married gely. He was weird, he was very nice. He left him an old man in charge: he gave to Dominick, to the vineyard lbe, six zechins hvndred for him, (a currency 60vt L250 E nglish,) and resided there about four months, although nat constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very mucb, and we lost n0 time in haste at the home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who was leading us to Tbe mansiori. It consisted of four rooms on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting room, a living room of 6 bedrooms, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green wolls, martel tables on each side, a large myrt1e in the cenlar, and a small fountain underneath, which could make the braurets play in movjng a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent post-brow; a large sofa or sofa complete the furniture. In the hal1 there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty box.There were no mirrors or a single painting. The bedehamber had only one large mattress lying on the fIoor, with two quilts of cotton and a bed of corn pjllow-tbe throvghout Greeco. In Ibe sitting, we observed a marble break, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to extract the content. On the painting of recreation, we find the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boilou, arid Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Ziminerman, in the German lariguage, Klopstock'f Mesfiah, the novels of Kotzebue, the play of Schiller des Robbers, the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; se verol petits pamphlets fr0m the Greek press in Constantinople, a lot lorn, but not in English 6ook of all the dccriplion. Most of these books were filled with marginal n0tes, written with a pericil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched al1, and marked with sheets af paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"Tobe lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his retum; for it is so special, that if I moved a thing without order, it would frown me for a little bit together; hc is also useful. I once made a servloe; and I took the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except for twenty zeophines which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in the cutting of cl frnall in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know why.\"\nThe entrance to the house outside was nice. The portico at the front was fifty steps l0ng and fourteen wide, and the flutod marble pillars with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now eustomary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surmounted by the light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkoy carpet, brieath a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the household loins are thus surpassed, as on it the Greoks pass their ovens by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christj\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nFor fear that we would enter the house, a small stream was gone, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shcld of two large bushes of myrtlc, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to his sons. \"I suppose,\" said the old husband, \"that he prayed far away he was very fervent, and that he was still attending our Twico church for a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe uiew of the seat Tbis was what could be torpedoed \"a bird-eyc vjew.\" A 1ire of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount CaIcla, covered with olive trees and blooming blueberries, hanging on the summil of wbich a temple of ariclont Groek appeared in majestic rot. A small current from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the cln horizon inlaid 6y a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a ljttle on the left, through a view of high chesnvt and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly obferved, spreading the light blue wave with spots of green emoraId. I rarely had a sight more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic s0litude: noo knows name bul Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our corilator, \"I'm sure he won't do it,\" he said, \"my old friend, can't you say it,\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to look at Armonlan, but when we came back to town, we learned to...\nThe details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nupal feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to olhers, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who had lost his own in a galc, and he often gave the Greek will to the poor cbildren. In short, it appeared to us, of all that we have gathered, lo was a very eccentric character arid benevolent. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the Cabin Tobe considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very 6eauliful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought out a piano-forte, and taught him the use of hlmfelf.\nThis was the information with which we left the island of Mitylene de Peacyfu1; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arriving in Palermo, our doubts are extinguished. Falling into the cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling iri Egypt and Greeco, \"The individual,\" he did, \"who in you are anxious, Lord Byron; I have it in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vjsite him al Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had beeri somc ycars srom home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pul in our hands we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every page. Didn't we regret not being more curous in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc ori on a day of sutvre; but to me that day will never come back. I'm making this...\nIndeed, there is no harm in believing it and in doing justice in the right name of his Iordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive dlsposition, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or add pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of beauty, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem lovc thcir sitting in hif bosom. The tenderness, the sympathy, and especially the applause to guide all his actions; and his courting on solitude restc 0f is in additional reasori to mark bim as a being whose heart the Religion has put its seal, and on which the head Bonevolence has tanned his annuitant. No man can circulate the previous \"traits\" without feeling proud of the bim as a countrymcln. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not suppose a right t0 to give an opinjon. The reports are always attentive to prudence, especially when they are directed against the moral irity of man; and the one who dares the jvstisy himself before this heinous court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a fel1ow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in scrutinizing, and flouting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virlu and self-approving heart c0nscience.\nTHE END\nGjllet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "19": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Wjlliam Po1idori\nTHE suporslition on which this tale is based is vory general in the East. Arabs it seems to be commori: it did not, however, extend senclf lo the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it only assumed jts prefent form since the diuision of the Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried on their territory, it gradually incrusted, and formed tbe subject to many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the bone the yaung and beautiful bone. In the west, it spread, with a little variatiori, throughout Hungary, Po1 and Austria, and L0rrain, where the cxisted belief, that the vampyres soaked in harm by a certain port of thorium blood uictims, which mingled, I0 their strenglh, and died rapidly of consumptlons; while these human blood suckers were fattening—and their vejns became distilled to suck a stclte of repletion, to cause the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even from the pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible, accruing to a particular case of vampyrism, which is statcd took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the chief and magistrates of the place, positively and unanimously asserted, that about five years earlier, a cortairi Hcyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been harassed to say that, at Cassvia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, by eating from the sorno of the earth of the tomb of tho vampy, and by rubbing himself with lime blood. This precaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming avampyre luiflf; for, about twenty or three days after his death and his hut, many people complained of being tortured by him, and a statement was made that four people had been depraved of life by his attacks. To preuerit furlher malice, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as is supposed to be usucll in cases 0f varnpyrisrn) frosh, and completely free from corruption, arid emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid bl0od. As the evidence was obtained, they ran the habit. A pole was completely led through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as sadly as if he had been set on fire. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into the grave. The same measures were adopted with corsesaf the people who had died previously curly vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should be oeome agents on the olhers who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vclmpyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tvrn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems that 6ettcr adapted to illustrate the fabjoct of current obsequences than any other jnstance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is consjdered as a sort of dead punjshment aftor, if there is a heinous crime committed while there exists, that the deceased is not over 1y do0 med to vampyrise, but forced to limit the iridescent visits only to those beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he fights by ties of kinship and affection.—A suppositori alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre; and when thou hast haunted the place of origin, and sucked the bl0od of all thy wreath; and from thence thy daughtcr, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of Iife: yet hate the banquet that shall draw thy living soul, thy victims, even thou shalt perish, and know the devil for their life: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursedst them, Your flowers are darkened on the stem. But he who falls for your crime, the youngest, the most beautiful of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your lame heart! You must put an end to your task, and you must mark the ringing of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glass glucence must see Whlch sreezes o'er his lifeless blue; Theri with the unhalifted hand must wear the braids of his yellow hclir, of which, in life, a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn—But now is carried cheerfully by lhee Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning lip, and your harging lip, and hunting your tomb, Go, and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from more cursed spectra than they.\nMr. S0uthey hcls also introduced in wild but beautiful bis Poein of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arab Oneiza, wbo is represented as having returned from the grave to torment him She's the 6 most loved one when she exists once. But this caririot bo supposod resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tourncfort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work on this subject, besidos a variety of anecdotes, traditional narrativetiff illustrative of its effects, put forward learned dissertatioris, tending to prove that it is a classi cal, as well as barbaric error.\nAlthough the present rnay suffices for the iimits of a note, which is unjustly devoted to exploration, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre if that in the most fanciful acceptance, it arogate several other syrionyms wjth, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroccolocba, VardouIocha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of a London winter, he appeared to the various parties of the dethoton leaders a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than for his rank. He looked at the mirlh around him, as if we couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who fell this feeling of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the object, did not seem to be pentrotering, and put on a look to pierce inside the work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. If he was charged in all the houses, everyone saw him, and they had been accused of excientity, and now felt the weight of the enul, we were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their alternance. In the epile of the mortal tint of her face, which never gained the guerilla tint, either of the bouffon of modesty, or of the strong emolion of passion, the form and the exterior were beautiful, many women hunters aflora notoriety aspired to gain her ottensions, and to gain, at least, some marks of whom the term migbt love: Lady Mercer, who had been thomackery of each mors iri drawing-rooms shewed from his mar rigle, thrown into himself, and everything except put on the robe of a mountain, to omit her opinion:—although in vajn:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived;—cend her impudence impuded inappluded whos baffled, and she left the field. But although the female adulter could not influence the acuity of his eyes, it was not because the female sex was indifferent to him: yes, it was the apparent cavtjon with wbich that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew how to address the hlmsel females. He had, rainbow, the reputation of a winning language; and if jt was that even he overcame fear af his sjngular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like howteri among these females wbo formtho vanter of thelr scx of their domestico vlrtues, as among those who venture it by their vicos.\nAt the same time, a young man named Aubrey arrived in Londori: he was an orphan for fear of having a single slster in possession of a great well-being.\n, by parents wb0 died while he was still in childhood. For fear that the guardians, who thought that it was only to take care of his fortune by the lake, would renounce the importarit of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cuves his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this feeling of honor and romantic frankness hjgb, which daily ruin so many apprentices rnllliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown ln by Providorice simply for the picturesque effeot af the scene, as we see it in romances: he thought tal the misery 0f a cottage was limited to the jacket of clothes, whieh were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of thc paintlcr by their irregular folds and various c0lovred patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of p0ets were the realities of life. He was bclndsome, frank and rich: for the tbesercasons, when he entered the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to decipher with the truth of 1easl their favorite languishing or blushing: the girls at the same time, by their brigant cauntains as he approached, and 6y their dazzling eyes, when hc opposed his lips, soon led to false notions of a talentf hif and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his s0litary hours, it was begun to find1 that, except in the caridles of tallow and wax that twinkle, born of the presence of a ghost, bul of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these assemblies of plaidslrig images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed the hif study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreoms, when tho extraordinary being we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked bim; and the very inconceivable to form the ari idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in hlmself, who had other signs of his obscrvationaf extemabjects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of lhejr conlact: to allow his lincgination to imagine everything that was wilting his propensity lo extrovagagant ideas, he soan formed this objeot irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rattling that the person before hiin. He became acqvclinte with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced in his opinion, that the presence bis was always re-echoed. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and he soon discovered, from the notes of preparation on the street, that it was abominable to trade. Desiring to obtain information about this singular character, which, until now, had on him curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for bim to perform the t0ur, while for many geriatrics has been sinil neo-trying to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of violence to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not a1lowing thom to appear as if fa1len from the sky, quander s candales intrigues arc mention af les sub-jocts 0f pleasantry or praisc, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately deserved his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fl atterod by sueh a brand of csteem of him, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other meri, he accepted with pleasure, and in some doy they had passed the circling waters.\nHltherto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity of a Lord Ruthv...\nThe character of, and now it has fovnd, that, by far more of its aotions were exposed to its point of view, the results offered different conc1usjons fret the apparenl olives to its conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idle vagabond, tbo, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey did not avoid remembering, that he was not on virtuous tbe, reduced t0 indigenco by the mesfortuncs even attend to the virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were scint from the door with sneezes barely removed; bul when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wall up in hif lust, or to sink him deeper into his iridquity, ho was sent far wilh rich charity. It was, he commented, attributed by him to the grafting importunity of the vicious, which, in general, predominates in the retiririg bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was a circonstance about charity towards her Lordship, which was even more impressed in her mind: every lhase upon which it was granted, InevitabIy found that there was a curse on her, for they were all ejther led to scaffolding, or sunk at the bottom and the moss abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrey surprised the apparent ardour with which his companion sought the centers of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in every tbe spirit of the Faro table: he bet, arid always won with success, except where the best known struck his antagonist, and then he lost more than he won; but he was still with tbe sarne unforgivable fao, with which he generally looked at the sooïte arovnd: it was not, however, when he heard the eruption young novice, or the fat without chance of a family of numbers; then he wanted to strengthen the law - this abstraction appclent of the mind was put aside, and his cyes were shining with more fire than that of the cat when dclllying dclllying with the half-dead mouse. In the city, he left the old easy youth, Tom from the pillow, cursed, in the solitude in the midst of a dungoo, the fate that had attracted him with the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, wilhout a single farthirig of his immcense delay weath, or with it to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take a m0ney from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last bo gorilla had snapped from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, who waf riot, however, able to fight the cunning of the rhore ex perienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his own profit; — but he delayed him — for every day he jumped his sricnd gave him an opportunity to scroller frclnkIy and op only to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, to be granted no gratification more gratification of him than the constant excitel of vain1y wsbing to break this inystry, which to bis exalled imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost for a while the sigbt of his companion; he left the bim in daily attendance on the morning circus of an Italian count, while he went in search of tho memorials of another deserted city. While he was engaged, letters came to England, and he impatiently penetrated; the first was fram his fist, wielding nothing but affection; the others were his guordians, the latter stunned him; if he had previously inherited in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough rouson to believe. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and urged that his chccraoter be terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction was more dangerous for solitude. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been generated by the hatred of his character; but that he had badly demanded, in order to revive his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of the careless vltue, to the lowly abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the account of thoir vltue, had, sjnce his departure, cast aside evon the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of vices lheir to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which ch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon the hiin completely, purpasing, in the way, while, t0 watch him more closed, and not to let pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, tal bis Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady of Tbe, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for a woman who is urimarized to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eye followed him in his windings, and soon distraught that an assignment had been attached, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, a hard girl without thought. Not wasting time, he entered the apartment 0f Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he knew that he was hating her very close. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions werc as he assumed\nsed a1l would hclve on such an oocasiori; and on beirig prefsed wbether that he intended to scam it, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, he must disappoint from that moment on the accompaniment of his Lordship in the rememote of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seek further appli cations, and calli ng on the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven riexl day simply sent his sergeant to inform hls complete penalty loa separation; bul did not suggest any suspicion of his plans having been foliod by Aubrey jnterp0sltion.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directod hif marched to Greece, and crossing the Penjnsu1a, soon found himself bimself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the hovse tbe of a Greek; and soori himself took care of himself by tracing the faded reeds os financializes glory on the moriuments which, apparently, enticed to chr onicling the acts of freemon only before the slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so attractive and delicate, that she had formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of a tbefiant bone into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of mjnd so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. Dancing on the plain, or tripping on the side of the hill, it would have been thought that the gazel1e a type of p0 or its beauty; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this sleeping luxury Iook of the animal svited but to the tasto of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, shows all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind tho, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he had deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the c0ntemplation of his figure of sylph. Often her braids would fall, as she fljtted araund, expose in the ray of the sun svch deljcately briing and quickly erase himself hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who first and escape from his mind the objcct even that he had previously thought of the vital importance your proper serpretation of a passage in Pausanjas. But why try to describe charms that are all seen, but none can appreciate?—It was inn0cence, youlh, and casty, vuntucated by aridstifIing ball drawing rooms. As he drew remajns of which he wanted to preorce a memorjal for his future hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of his pencjl, tracing the socnes of his place of origin; she would then describe to him the circlrig dance on the open plain, painting, to him in all the brilliant colors to the youthful inemoratory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having looked at in his infoncement; and then, turning to subjects that obviously bad Mado a grea ter impressionnerjon on his mind, would tell in all the supernatural tales to his nurse. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the ties of dcarost, forced each year, by attaching herself to the life of a lava woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, his blood was running cold, he tried to tear him from such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ionthe quoted to him the names of old men, who had, in the end, elected an old amorig themselves, after several parents and children heirs had been found marked with the seal of the apity of the fiond; and when she found it so iircredulovs, she begged to believe him, for he had been, pointed out, that the discorders who had debanded to question exjsence, had always had evidence given to him, that they had been obliged to do so, and that they had had had a broken heart. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still pcrsist persuading her, that lhere could not be true in the fears of the ber, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to exoile or believe iri the punctual power of Lord Ruthven.\nAu6rey began to cling to Ianthe and even more, his jnnoeence, so caught up in all the infected virtues of women omong that he had soughl for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a girl Grcek uneducated, he found himself even more attached to the almost magical form of TB before him. He sometimes moved away from her, and, sleeping a plari for the antiquarian somo search, he left, decided the riot to return until his object was reached; but ho always found it impossible to fix his attontion on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained a tbal fcemed image only legitimate tbe possessor of his ghts. Ianthe was not capable of his love, and had never had the same infallible frankness that he had known for the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was him because she didn't have 1onger clny with whom she could live her favorite bluffs, while her guardian was busy in the skelching or the discovery of a few frogs whooh helfcaped the deftrvctive hclnd of time. She had appealed to her parents or the suhject of Vampyros, and both, with the present severaI, affirmed their oxislonce, pae with horror in the name itself. After Saon, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both not to come back at night, for he had to go through the wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration.\nHere we go. They described it as resart 0f the vampyres in the night orgies of thcjr, and denounced the heaviest evi1s as improning on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey praised their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal p0wer, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattended on his cxcvrsion; he was surprised to obscure the melonchole face of the host dehjs, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terror. Ianthe, whom he was about to leave, came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him for retum, and allowed to put the power of these inactjon beings;—he promised. He was so busy in his research that he did not perceive that the daylight was going to stop, and tbat iri tho horizon there was an af these spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly assemble in a mass trcmendous, and pour out all their rage towards the devoted land.—He at 1st, Howevcr, climbed his horse, determined to catch 6th speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in this southern climadef, is almost unknown; immediately the sun feels, the night begins: and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its failing thunders had barely a resting interval — its thick heavy rain f0rcedits path through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue llthning seemed to be running out of breath and radiating at its feet. Suddenly the horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible rclpidity through the tangled forest. The animal at the point, through the fcltigue, stopped, and found, by the glabre of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hashish which hardly lifted up the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Dlsmount, he approached, advanced to find someone for the gujde in the city, or at least relying on the obtlinity of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shrioks of a wianan who mingled with the stjfled, the exulting mockery of a laugb, continued in an almost eye-free sound; — he was surprised; but, blushing the thunder that was raging again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remarks were made by hjm. He found himself in a coritact with someone whom he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out: \"Again gagged!\" to whom a loud laughter took hold; he felt overwhelmed by the one whose strength was found superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his onemy threw himself on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his haris in his throat — when he glamorous torches rnany penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; — he instantly1y pink, and, leaving his prey, rvsbed through the door, and in a moment crashing branches, as he broko through the wood, was no longer bearded. The storm was still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought out, who was dragging him with his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was hjs h orror, when the light of l0rches once again bvrst upori him, to marsgray the cliry form of his beautiful conductor brought a corse of liftles. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an arifjng vision of his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no c0lour vpon cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence abovt his face which seemed almost as attached as the life that once inhabited the threshing: — on his neck and chest was blood, arid on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men ponted, wandering, simulariely struck with horror, \"A V ampyre! A vampire!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey waf posed by the sido of his who hod lately was the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died the wilhin. He did not kriew what he was, his mind was rocked and seemed shvn reselection, and lako refuge in vacclincy, he held unconscious alrnost in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her that an annuitant had missed. Their unthinkable cries, as Lhey approached the city, signalled a terrible catastrophe. \"That it would be impossible to describe their gicf; but when they became client the causo of the death of their child, they did so in Aubrey, and p0inted lo thc corse. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2e with a very violent fever, arid was often delusional; in these hc iritervals would call Lord Ruthven and on Ianlhe—by an incomprehensible ocombination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. To other linden trees, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven went there to arrive in Athens, and according to Wbatever's motive, in hcaring in the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant landing. The lcltter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starred by the sight of him whose image he now had with the end of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the false It which had caused separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. But as soon as his conualescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey pigeivcd no djfforence from tho former man, exepts that sometimes he was surprised to meet his eyes fixed undisputedly on him, with a smile of ma1ciovs exultation playing vpon his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the last stage of the recovery of lnvalid, Lord Rvthven wcls apparently engaged jn to monitor the waves without tides raised by the cooling creoze, or by marking the progress of these orbs, circumcise, like our world, the sun without movo;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this sbock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had such a distinguished it now seemed to be running away never sore. He was now as o lovers of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bul as he is for solitude, his mind could find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the vines which he had once frangled, the shape of Ianthe stood on the bis side – if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of modest life; then to turn, would show, to his wild irgination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, each feature of which created bitter fuch associations ln bis esprit. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tendor's care, to take him during the disease bis, that they should visit the parts of Greece neitber had seen again. They went in all directions, and searched for all places where a renown might be set in motion; but they hastened from one place to another, but they did not seem to listen to the battle they were watching. They heard many robbers, huts they begged little by little to diminish the relations of lasc, which they imagined to be only the indiv idualf's invontion, whose interest was to excite tho generosily of those whom they defended against the preterized dangers. As a result of neglecting the inhabitants, one day they traveled with a few guards, more to serve as guidos than to defend. At the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocky drafts coming from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of the riegligence of the air; for there were few members of the party engaged in a narrow pass, they were surprised by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by the account of several guris. In an instant, the guards were afraid to have them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to be in the directjori from which the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubrcy, imitatirig their example, withdrew for a bit bchind the sheltoririg tower of defilement: but shameful to be so guarded by an enemy, what with insulting cries told them to hang, and being exposed to a slave without resistance, if one of the thieves sh0uld cli mb ab0ve surd lake iri the back, they deteririod at the same time to rush in search of enernia. Hardly had they lost the belt of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought bim to thc Grourid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer being the object of the contest or of his own peril, is soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately thrown his arms and svrenderod.\nBy the promises of a great ravine, Aubrey soon pushed them to throw his wounded fried into a nearby hut; and havirig accepted a ransom, he no longer cared about their presence, they contented themselves with mcrely to keep the entrance until the comrade thojr returned with the promised sum, far from where he had a scam. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to be accommodated by basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as insensitive to the pain as he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who was encouraged to offer his help with more than usual caresses—\"Assistant! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I have taken into account my existence as little as that of Passiririg day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. — \"Ineed bul little — my life flies quickly — I can't explain the whole — but if y0v would hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — ouid if my death was unknown for some shooting in Englari—I—but life. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying husband, rising up with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that, for a year and a day, y0u will not give your knowledge of my criins or death to any living being, whatever happens, or what you can see. His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" Sajd Aubrey, he laughed at his p1low, and no longer breathed.\nAubrey rested, but didn't sleep; the mclny circonsclances attending to his knowledge of this man rose on his mind, arid he knew nat Why; when he performed his oath a cold chill came upon bim, as if the presentation of something horrific were waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when O Robber met Hiin, and informed him that it was not long there, wailing down from his sons and comrades, at his retirement, to the pirinacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they gave evil to his seigneury, that he should be exposed your first cold ray to the moon that shaves after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and took several of the men, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. Bvt, whom he had climbed to the top of Tbe ho, found no trace of the c0rpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were penetrating the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was stunned by conjectures, but he returned to Lasl, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nLosing a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently aspired to raise this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon adorned at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol to transmit it to Otranto, or NapIes, he took advantage of it by fixing the effeots he had by making him belong to Lord Ruthveri. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of attack, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. When he turned them around, and looked at their curious forms, which was surprising to find o sheath adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in fatal hut tbe — he shvdered — rushed to win the furious proof, he found the weaving, on his horror can be imagined when he discovers that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not lack any other certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular form, the fame of the shoots on the hast and the sheath were similar in splendovre on both, and I have no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each one.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the way back from hjs, clt Rome, hjs first investigations were about the bad lady hc with the intention of extracting seducivc arts from Lord Ruthven. Her parenles were iri distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this 1cldy had caused a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. Hc became morose and silent; and his only pusist job iri exhorting the speed af the pastilions, as if he were going to save the life of somo that he held dear. He came to Calais; the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tied him to the English parts; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to the loft, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all remembrance of the past of lho. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more saddened as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning gracc that won her eyes on the applause of the salon assemblies. There was no light brilliance tbclt that exists only in the cured atmosphere of an annoid apartment. His blue eyc was never illuminated by the reindeer's levity. There was a melancholic charm abovt it that did not seem to emerge from misf0rturia, but from some sourling in it, which seemed to indicate a sub-I conscious of a brilliant kingdom. Except not was tbat light foot, which strays where to er a butterfly or color can attract—it was sedclte and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by the brightness of joy; but when her brother breathed in her affection, and her presencc would forget the pains that she knew to destroy her rest, who could have harassed her smile for voluptvary? It seemed af if those eyes,—that face then played in the light of their own native spbere. She was still eighteen years old, and had not been brought to the world, it had been thought by her guardian more in shape that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return fraternizing the continent, when could be her proleclor. So it was now solved lhat tbe next drawjng-room, which was rapidly opproaching, should be the time of his enlry in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey prefers to stay in his father's house, and feeds on the melancholy that surpasses him. He could not feel the iriterest on the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit of hjs had bcen so torn by the hadents having wilnes sed; but to be discouraged from sacrificing bis own comfort to the protection of hjs sisler. They came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been dished out and a living room.\nThe crowd was in excess — a tiirig-room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened to go. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the thal of remembrance the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he just felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, smiled at his ear—\"Remove your oath.\" He was having trouble with tvrn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would make him lose, when he pierced, a little distance away, the figure of the samc that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked up to 1 hls limbf almost refuseirig to carry their weight, he was forced to take the tick orm of a friend, and to predict a passage through the crowd, to be thrown hjmself into the hls car, and was driven home. He hastened with hasty stops, and six of his barrids have lifted his head, as if he had sighed that his sighs were bursting out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in the dreadfuI picture — the dagger — his oath.—He himself, he could not be as possible — death rises agajn!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be reol — so he decided to go back to society; for although he tried to ask for the indictment L0rd Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his fisher to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated to a reef, and there he prepared for his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that many were leaving, he awoke and entered another room, and found his sister overwrapped by many, apparently in a serious conversation; hc tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed his spankings to him. He hates foam. And he took his sister's arm, and hurriedly he swept her into the street; and at the street he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged, he heard this voice murmuring again near Hiin: \"Remember the oath of Yaur!\"; he dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey bocame almost distracted. If, before his mind was absorbed by a svbject, how much more compictively was he absorbed, now that the certainty of the amateur's love binds a pressed gain on hjs lhoughls. Her sister's attention was no longer heard, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and he terrified her. The inority he thought was that he was more obsessed. His oath surprised him;—did he say to let this monster wander, 6 to ruin himself on his chest, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. If he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought of using his own hand t0 frec the world brake such a wretched; but doralh, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in a bis room, he saw no one, and he only struck his sister, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, rio more able to support flillness and loneliness, ho loft his house, wandered from slreet to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted bim. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humidity of the middle. He was no longer recognized; he first came back with the tbo h0use; but finally he set him up with your reft where fatigue overtaken him. His sister, anxious for security, entertained people to follow him; but they were quickly removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – from thought. His conduct, the howling, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea left by his absence the offering of his friends, with a fiend of the arnangst, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to again attract society inta, ond wateh closely, anxious of f0rewarn, in spile ofhjs oath, all that Lord Ruthveri has approached spiritual intimacy. But when he entered a room, bis hagard and the suspicious glances were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for the love of the heart, a society that affected him so strongly. When, commentevcr, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the gvardians took hold of the intrusive, and, fearing that the bis spirit would become alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that was previously imposed on the thcrn by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to drunken him with wounds and svfferingf which he had every day encumbered in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they oonsided madness, they built a physlcian with rosid in the hovse, and constantly take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, so his mind was indeed obsorbed by the subjeet 0ne terrlblc. His incoherence was so great that he was confined to his cham6er. There, he often spoiled himself for dcly, unable to be attracted. Ho had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glassy luster; — the only sign of affection and remembrance was manifested on his sister's entrance; then hc would begin something, and, grasping his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he misunderstood her from not typing him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near Hiin!\" When, however, she asked whom he resisted, if only the answer was: \"True! True!\" And again, he fell into a slate, that she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months:gradua1, however, as the year passed, his iricoherences became less freckled, and his spirit softened part of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day he counted on his singers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe dynasty had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of the guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the circumstantiated melancholy of Aubrey's bejng in such a horrible fituation, which went his sister the next day to get married. Undoubtedly the attentiori wos of Aubrey attracted; he asked anxioufly to whom. Happy to have marked the return of the intcllect, whose TBey feared that he had been deprived of beeri, lhey mentions the name of the Count of Marsderi. Thinking that he was a yovng's count whom he had met in the soeiety, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They didn't answer, bvt in a few minules his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected 6y the irfuence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought that his brother was once alive with feelings of affection. He began to flatter himself with all his warmth, and to congratulate bor upan on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and arduous accompaniment; who suddenly he piqued a medallion on his chest; open it up, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced him for so long. He split the portrait into a paroxysm of rclgo, and trampled it under f0ot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed her future husband's refemblancc, to be looked at as if he had caused her to riot—then seize her haries, and gastirig on her with a frantic expression os coventenance, he said that she would never marry this gentleman, for he—but he could not advance—it seemed that this baye bim voice remembered his oath—he suddenly turned, thinking Lord Ruthven wos near him bvt sclw no one. In the moticine the guards and the doctor, who badly bearded the whole, and thought that cewaf but a retum of bis djsorder, entered, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, wanted her to be the hiin. He fell on his larn knces, he implored, he raised lhein to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this your the madness that they imagined hcld took possession of his mind, wanted to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven called Tbe morning after the shooting, and bad incn refused with all the elso. When he became aware of Aubrey's health, he realized that he was the cause, but that he was taught to believe that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be attributed to those among whom he did not gain this training. He hastened to go to the house with his former companion, and by a hard presence, and by a great affection for his brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually became in the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wor? His long life had dangers ond toil to rocount—could speak of himself as a lndjvidual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded eclrtb, except with her that he addressed himself;—could you know how, since he knew her, her existence, had 6ogun to seem worthy of conservation, if she simply wretched that he could listen to his soothing appreciatives;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, that he gained beautiful affections. The title of the former Banncb was given to him at length, he obtained an Irish embassy, which served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) that it took place on the eve of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was lcft by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the fervents, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; they gave him hlm; he wrote a letter to his siftcr, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own fault, her owl honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, that one day he held her in their arrns as the hope of Ibeir and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this weeping, when he denounced the heaviest curses. The promisod servant they would deliver; but give it to the doctor, so it is better not to harass Miss Aubrey's spirit any more by, qual he considered, thc raves os a maniac. The night did not rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Auhrey heard, with a horror that can be easier to conceive than described, the notes of bufy preparatlon. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Avbrey grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless woman. He took the opportunity, if a sound had come out of the room, and in a moment, it was in the apartment where all of them were 16 immediately assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him with rage. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your 0atb, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, that Sister Yaur was dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the elder's wife, had kidneys of him. Aubrey could no longer support his sons; his rage had not found a vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. It was riat mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physiciari was afraid to shake him. Marriago was celebrated, and the bride and bridegro0m left London.\nIncreased weakness of Aubrey; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be c allod, and when midnight had struck, to be bound in a composite way that the reader tbe persisted—he died immediately after.\nTbe's guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, ond Aubrey'f Fister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING A ANACCOUNT FROM THE RESIDENCE OF LDRD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world stands before him, the hero will choose his place of rest, and the guide of Gravity.\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty's vcsel, in the year 1812, wo put int0 the port of Milylcne, in the island of this dwarf. The beouly of this plagiarism, and the supply of certclin of cattle and vegetables still at the 6th had there, led many British vessc1s to visit him — both men of war and merchantinen; and although he rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums paid a great deal for tbo deviation from a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was watered, and the shipowner negotiated for the cattle, the natives, the c1ergyman, and the inyself took a ram in the cave called Homer's School, and in other places, where we were here. On the front of Mount Ida (a sma1l mound so named) we had the spirit and engarod a young Greek like our gould, who told us that he had come from Scio with a lord of the Engl, all the Ifland four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and should have given me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his fclucca very often to the different islarids.\"\nThis account exudes our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste any time hastening to the bouse where 0ur peasant had resided. An old man who led us over the mansion has gracefully accelerated us. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. Tbey were simply decorated: green coloured walls, marble lables on ejther slde, a large myrtle in the center, and a benothed srall fountain, which could be made to play through the branehcs by movirig a source fixed in the small brorize cl sjde Venus in a lean posture; a large hood or sofa camplotted furniture. In the hall stood an English half-dozon of the cane chairs, and an empty k-case boo: tbere were rio mirrors, nor a single pajnting. The bedehamber had only a large rnalter spread on the ground, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a plow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man said vs, flipod with books and papers, which wcre then iri the breast of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the content. On the tablet, the hives of the Empires of Voltaire, Shokfpcare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of Volney; Zimmerrnan, in German; the Messioh of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press al Conslantinaple, much to nr, but no English book of any descrlption. Most of these books were filled with morginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. Thc Messiah was literally scratched alI, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remclrks.\nThe man said: \"The Lord had been lurig lhese books in the evening before he defiled, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for he is so special, if I had put something without order, he would frown on rene for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service, and I have the praduc of this farm for the trophle of the carca oss, except twenty zechins that I pay to an agonized Armenian who resides in a small hilling iri the wood, and wh0m tho lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the outer huso was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty steps long arid fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and sret-work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were eonsiderahly higher than the roof of tobe. The roof, surrounded by a balustrade with light stamens, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awnjng of strong coarse linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, as on larn the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, clnd enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left of Tbe, while we were closing the house, a small brook slipped oway, grapes, oranges and lime trees were embedded togetber on its b0rders, and under the shade of two large bushes of blueberries, a marble seat with an ornamental wood background was placed, on which we were told, the Iord pasfed many of his evenings lingered until twelve hours, reodating, writing, and aligning to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe viow of this seat was what we can call \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, surrounded by olive trees and blueberries, and on the top of whicb a temple of Grcek appeared in majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, vntil it was the last iri the woods near the base of the moritaine. The smooth fea like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by an island of fins, finished the view in front; and a little 0n left tip, through a vist of hazelnuts lofly and palm trees, small fevorous islands were distinctly o6servated, spreading the light blue wave with emerald spike spots. I rarely liked a vjew more than I did; for our investigations were without results as to the name of the pers0n who hcld sold out in this romantic solitaire: no one knew his namo but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armerian,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't say it,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can, do it, I dare riot. We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but a return to the city of Ibe we left the sovereign details of the ifoliated lord. He had bit eight thyig girls when he wos lasted on the Ifland, and eueri was dancing with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving tbees. He also bought a new b0at for a fisherman who badly raised his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been an eccentric and caring vory character. A circumstance we learned, whieh our old frjend at the cottage thought appropriate not to discoloso. He raised a very beautiful girl, with whom the lord was osten seen walkjng on the shore sea, and he did wrong bought him a piano-strong, and taught him so much to use it.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; 0ur imaginations everything on the rack, guessing who this logger in Greece or him. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eocentricities that mark the poeuliar genius. Arrived in Palermo, gripped our doubles wero dissipated. Fal1ing in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had 6oe traveling to Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual,\" he said, \"aboul that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trclvels on the island of Tenedos, and I visited him in Mitylene.\" Wo had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we have been a few years of hame; but \"Enfant Haralde\" being put in our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply djd we regret not having been curious in the research ovr al the cottage, bvt we comforted ourselves with the idea of resuming to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I do this spreading, believing that he riots completely urinlerest, and in court in the gaod name of his seigneury, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, inverse to the association of the humon riature, or contributing in any way to soften its sentences, or to add to its plaidsuros. The fact is directly upside down, af can bo plain1y galhered from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of finor of the heart, so elegantly doped in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in bis bos0m. Trend, sympathy, and charity oppear to guide all his acions; and bis courting rest af solitude is cln son of roa extra to mark him as a being on whose heart ReIigion put his sea1, ond ouer whose head Benevolence threw his coat. No man can read the above pleasant \" traits\" wilhout felling provd of him as a peasant. Respecting his rents or pleosures, I don't suppose a trubbt gives an opirian. The reprimands must be received with caution, in particular the wheri directed against the iritegrity morcll of man; and the one who dares justjfy hjmsels use that the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a fcllow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is w0rthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the worl'd, is the surest testirnony of a virtuous heart on-Approve consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-courl, Fleel-Street.",
    "20": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very crazy in the East. Among the Arabs, he appears to be a common bc: he did not extend, hawever, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; clndit did not assume his prosent form sinco the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which timo, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, he gradually indecisived himself, and formed the subjecl of many wonderful stories, still extinct, of the dead rising from their graves, clrid feeding on the blo0d of the beautiful young clnd. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout all Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the cxisted belief, that vampyres nightimbibod a certain porti0n of the blood of their victims, which bceame emaciated, lost their strengtb, and quickly djed of consvmptions; while these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veins becamo dissolves to such a stote of repulsion, to cause the blood of passages of the irbodief, and even of the pores themselves of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is curious, and, of course, crediblo accounts of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvngary. He oppearf, that with the exception of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the island, they positially and unwaveringly affirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, namod Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cassovja, on the borders of the Turkish Seruia, he had been tarnished by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and rub himself with his blood. This precautjon, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy, for, about twenty or thirty days after death and burial, mony persoris complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of reading by bis attacks. In order to avoid sowing evil, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in the casos of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting to the inuth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to a personalized remedy. A stake was completely divisive of Arnold Paul's heart and body, which is said to have shouted so terribly as if he had been olive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. Sarnetic measures were adopted with the corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they would become agents in their tum over others who survived lhem.\nThe universal 6elief is, beats a person chased by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nMoristrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of observations prefers than any other infestation that might occur. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a fort of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed in existence, that the deceased is not only made for vclmpyrise, but lamented to limit his infested visits only to those beings he washed the most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—An aluded supposition in the \"Giaour\".\nAs Vampyre sent him to the earth, then shall thy corsus be cut off from his tomb: then haunt the place of origin, and suck the blaod of all thy seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, by midnight draineth the stream of life: yet hate the banquet that knocketh shall feed thy living lovable corsus, thy victims, which still expire, shall know the devil for their sire: as ye cursed, ye slay them, thy flowers are wretched upon the grave. But he who for your sting must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Bénira with the name of his father — This word will envelop your heart in flaming! But you must put an end to your tuft and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who made his blue lifeless; then the spirit of the hand without tearing tearing apart The tresfees of his low hair, of whicb, in life a lock when the offering of the tender affectionary was carried—But now is borrious far by Leo Memoriol os thy agony! But with your own blood, your snoring and your harging lip, and after your grave, Go-clnd, with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll, these in Harror, are mixed with a more cursed specter than they are.\nMr. Sotbey also intraduccd in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corsc of the good Arab Onei2a, who was reprimanded as having returned from the cave for the purpose of tormenting him, which she loved better during her existence. But it cannot be assumed that t0 was the result of the sinfulness of her life, that she was harassed throughout history as an omplet type of purlty and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account of his journeys of surprising cases of vampyrism, to which one claims to have an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a uariety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, has pulsed some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classical error, as well as barbaric bones.\nMany curious and jnteresting opinions on this singularly horrible superstition could be added; thovgh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple reinarking, that if the term Vampyre is the acceptance of an iri mast gene, there are olhers Sovereign synonymous with it, the madc use of in various parts of the tbe world: like Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThere are vampires.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parties of the leaders of thc tone, more remarkable for his slngularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous caught his attention, so that he could by a laok suffocate him, and throw foals into those breasts where reigned unconsciously ncss. Those who felt this serisatlon of apprehension did not explain from where he had risen: the same was true of the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, ouid to the glanco lo orie pierce through lho the interior works of the home; but fell on the check with a radius of lead weighed on the skin that he could not pass. The peculiarities of Hjs caused Bim to intoxicate every house; all desired to see him, and lhose who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in lheir prescnc capable of erecting their ottention. Despite the dead hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, whether it is the modesty of modesty, or the emotion of passion, although her strength and contours are beautiful, many female hunters have tried to gain her attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they say of affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters she had been wearing in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put in the robe of a mountain6ank, to attract her attention:—but in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed to her, it seemed that they were reckless;—even her unapplied imprudentness was flouted, and she had to avoid the field. But the adultery commori could not influence even the gujdance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but such was the caution with which he spoke to the virtuoso woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever speaking to hjmself lo females. He had, howovor, the reputation of a winning tongve; and if it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that tbey were m0uded by his apparent hatrcd device, he was often among those women who formed the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as omang thaso who shoved him by their viccs.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphari left with a single sieve in possession of the great wcalth, by parerits that died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself also by the guards, who had their duty to sow the fortune, that they abandoned the greater charge of his mlnd at the core of merconary subalterns, he cultivated moro his imagination than his judgment. Ho had, therefore, this feeling of honor and condor high romantjc, which every day ruin so many apprentices of thousand. He believed everything to sympathize with the virtue wjtb, and thought that the vice was launched in 6y Providence simply for the picturesque effect 0f seen, os we pay in romances: he tang ht that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter 6y their irregular folds and vclrieux colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the virtues of life. Ho was beautiful, devious, and ricb: for these reasons, when he entered the jnto gay circles, in any mother surrounded him, trying to describe with the truth of the east their languishing favourites: the girls clinged at the same time, by their fiery runnings which he approached, and by their glittering eyes, when he opened his lips, soori led him to false riots of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but fr0m lack of snuffing, there was no furnace in real life for any of these congreries of folds and tough descriptions in the volumes of thosc, from which he had formed his study. However, finding some comperifaction in his gratified vanity, he was lowered to reljnquish his dreams, which the extraordinary being that we bave abovc described, passed him through in his career.\nHe observed it; and very irresistible to form an idea of the character of an entire husband absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs to his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence, implied by the evitanoo of their contact: cllIawing his imagination to imagine every thing tbat flattered his propensity to cxlavagant ideas, he quickly formed tbis ohjcct in thc hera of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become acquainted with him, has paid him attentjons, and so far has had on hif opinion, which his presence wos has always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was on the journey. Desiring to obtain information about this character singer, who, until now, had only whipped his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the vice's career in order to put themselves on an equal footing with the elderly, and not to allow them access as the sky has fallen, that scandalous intrigues are mcntioned as subjects of ploasantry or praise, according to the degree of competence shown in their conduct. They agreed: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive a bim proposal for jojn. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which by chance had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they passed the waters of the circle.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has made sure that, although many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results offer different conluations of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idle, the vclgobond, and the beggar, received fr0m his hand mare that was enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not try to point out that the jl was not on the iurtuouf, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, which he had given his alms; — these were sons of the gate with sneezes barely removed; but when the profligatc came to ask for something, not to relieve his wills, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. It was ardently attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which, in general, extended to the bafhitude of the retreat of the virtuous needy. There was a circonstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the Iowest and the inost abject miscry. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the vices of fashion; he entered there the whole spirit of Faro's tab1e: he bet, and always played successfully, excepl where the best known was his aritagonist, then he lost even inority than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at the ciété around: it was not, however, that he encountered the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of f0rtvne — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, arid his eyes sparked more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the mouse half-deciding. In every city, he lifts the youth formerly deafening, torn from the circle, he cursed, cursed, in the soljtude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him wlthin lhe to reach 0f his fiend; while mony cl father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his immense wealtb fire, where to buy even enough to satisfy their desire presentered. He did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder whom he had just pulled from the convulsivo catch of the innocent: it could but be the resv1t of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, h0wever, capable of taming the attainment of the most experienced. Au6rey often wishes to represent him to his friend, and begs him to resuscitate this charity and pleasure which have proved the ruin of all, and which do not tend to his own prosit; — but he dislodged him — for he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly at bim; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven jn his car, and amjdst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye without voice as his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain great or gratification from her that the tough excitement of vainly wishing to breclk lhat mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the tedious appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey spent time lost sight of his compani0n; he left bim in daily attic on tbo morning circle of Italian Countess ari, while he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, that he entered into impatience; the first came from his sister, 6reathirig nothing affection 6ut; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination of irito that there was a bad power resident in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on immediately crushing his friend, and urged, that his character was terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had acquired, for enhanoc his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had to be cast out from the pinnacle of the urisulized virtue, down from the abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that every female, wbom, he had suggbt, apparently on the habituance of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed to you the deformation of the whale of their vices to the publc gaze.\nAubrey dismayed leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjrigle luminous point on which rcst the eye. He resolved to instil a perfect pre-lext to abandon it completely, by seeking, in the medium wbile, to monitor it more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same oircle, slow soori perceived, his Lordsbip wos finishing to work on the inexperience af the daughter of the lady wbose whom he mainly frequented. Iri Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met with the society; he was therefore obliged to keep his plclns in secret; the eye of the Aubrey hut followed him in all his windings, and soon defamed that an assiduary had been designated, which would be the most likely erid in the ruin of a young girl, though invincible. Without losing his fire, he won't miss Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked the lady for her repulsive intentions, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his desire to meet her. Lord Ruthven replied, that the intentions of hjf were such that he assumed that all would have on such an ocoasion; and after being pressed that he intended to marry hor, he laughed meroly. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship on the night of the visit, he ordered bis servant to look for other apartments, and called vpan tho mitcr of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about his Lordshlp's choracctcr. The assignatiori were...\nThat's right. Lord Ruthven the following day merely sent his fervent to notify to hls full consent to a septclration; but did not suggest clny sus-\nThe picion of his plclns was thwarted by Auhrey's interp0sition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the Peninfula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the hovse of a Greek; arid soon occvpiced himself in the race for documents erased from ancient glory on inunumenls hot apparently, shame to chronicle the acts of freemon only before the slaves, had asked the emselues under the ground shelterjng or mary colored licheri. Under the same r0of as he, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that sbe could have formed the madel for a pointer wanting to pour on convls the prornised hope of the faithful in the paradise of Mohammed, except that his eyes spoke t0o a lot of spirit for any ori to think that it could belong to those who had no Sauls. As it was deigning on the plain, or tripped along the side of the moon, one bathe thovght lhe gazelle a poor type 0f his bounties; for whom havo exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of naturo arimated, for this luxurious look asleep of the anjmcll adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light step of Ianthe often abated Avbrey in his search for swelling antiquities, and often w0 could be a non-corresponding girl, tight in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty to its shape, floating as it was on the wind, to the aigor look of him, who forgot the letters that he came from doyphcred on a nearly effaced tablet, in the cortemplement of his figure of sylpb-like. Osten would like his braids to fall, as if it were a matter of threading, to display in the ray of the sun such brilliantly shining shades that quickly fade, he migrates well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets his body escape the very object that he has hcld before thinking of the vital importance ta the good interpretation of a possession in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate?—It was innocent, youthful, and beautiful, without being affected by crowded rooms with arid drawers Stiflirig balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep the memorial for his future hours, she snuck herself, and looked at the mogic effects of his penciI, plotting the scenes of his place of origin; she then described at hjm the circular dance on the open plinth, painted to him in all the brilliant colors of the memory of the youth, the pomp of marriage that she remanifested while looking at her childhood; and then, turning to subjects who had emptied a greater impression on her mind, hlm recounted all the supreme tales of her nanny. Her apparent conviction of what she was telling exacerbated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as she said in the account of the livjng vclmpyre, who had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to provide her life for the following months, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh out of svch idlc and horrible puppets; but Ianthe quoted to her the name of old men, who had at last deciphered one living among the lhemself, after many of their relatives and chjldren had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, begged him to believe it, for he was evil b een, notes, that those who dared to question their existence, have always had a proof of givon, which has forced TBem, with the staggering pain, to confess that he was lure. She detailed the lraditlonal appearance of these monsters, and her horror multiplied, by a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her breasts, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural pore of Lord Rvthven.\nAubrey bcgan to be more arid altach to Ianthe; his innocence, his contrast with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he did not seek for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while ridiculing the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari without duet Gre ek girl, he found himself still mare and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He would rip it out to Tyrncs srom it, clnd, forming a plari for some antiquariari research, he would leave, determined not to return until his object was reached; bvt he always found it impossible to fix his clttentiori on the ruiris around him, while in his mind being retclinated an image that seemed to be the only right tbe owner of his thoughts. Ianthe was dishonest of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. She seemed to have left the bin reluctantly, but there are difficulties because she no longer had one with whom she could screw her fav-\nwhile his guard was busy sketching 0r discovering a fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to ber parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale of horror in the name itself. S0on aftcr, Aubrey decided to carry out one of the bis excursions, which was detairi for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, at the same time begged him not to return to the night, as it must necessarily pass through a waod, where no Greek would ever remain, after the doy closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the mousse ailments as imminent on him wbo dared to cross the way to Jr. Aubrey made the ligbt of their representatives, and tried to bring them out of the idea; but when he saw them mocking a superior, infernal power, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nNexl morning Aubrey went on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and urged him to come back, and the night took the power of these beings to be pul iri actinjon; —bo promised. He was so busy in his research that he did not perceive that the light of the day was about to end, and there was in the hori2on one or those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly, got into a huge mass, and poured out all their fury on the devoted land.—He finally went up his ha rse, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: the butt was too late. The dusk, in these southerly climates, is almost urikriown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echo tbunders had barely the ari de resl interval — its heavy rain forced its woy through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked lightning blue tbe seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse took frigid, and was carried with draconian speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found itself, by the glare of the ligbtning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly rose up from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he seized, hoping to find one to guide him to t0wn, or at least trvsting to get her1ter coat of the storin. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a womani mingling with suffocation, exulting with a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound;—it had begun—\nbut, awakened by the thunder that aclin rolled on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced to open the door of the cabin. He found himself in the darkness of the uttor: the sound, h0wevcr, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for although he collided, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He did not hear any more talking to anyone who immediately felt himself harassed by a force which seemed superhuman to him: he determined to sell his lifc as dearly as he could, and read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the gr0und: — his enemy threw himself on the bim, and knelt into his chest, had laid his hands on his rod; — when the glass of many torches penetrated into the hole which gave rise to ljghtin; — he rose up instantly, and threw his prey, and rushed through the door, and in an instant the crash of the branches, as he pierced the wood of the torches. Tbe storm was still n0w; and Aubrey, unable to m0ving, was soon heard by lhose without. They entered; the light of their torch fell on the mud, and the lhatch loaded on each individual straw wilh heclvy footflakes. At Avbrey's will, he lay down for the one who had drawn bimby shouts; he was again left in dclrknesf; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again upon him, to the airy shape of his beautiful conductor brought a corse without life. He closed hif eyos, hopirig that it was only an arislng of vision of bis disturbed the imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, extended by his side. Tbere was rio color upori his cheek, not even on the ber lip; but there was silence on his face lhat seemed almosl as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — for his men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was 1aid next to her who had recently been to him objecl of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was tainted with a bourbier and seemed to run away from reflection, and he took refuge in a shelter, he held alrnost unconsciously iri his hand a bare dagger from a particular builder, whicb had been found in the hut. They were quickly met by different parts that had been erected in search of her who had missed a motter. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, foretold the parents of some terrible cltastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the Corsican. They were incoriable, both died in the heart of the broker.\nAubrey being pulsed to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals, Lord Ruthven and Ianthe would be called upon – by a certain inexplicable umbiliation, he scemed to beg of his former companiori to spare the beirig he loved. At the time, he permeated the maldiction on the head of bis, ond the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ebabi to this timc lo arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, on jng of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he resumed his delirium, he was horrified and starred at the sight of him whose image he had n0w combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by words hjs kirid, imploring almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and climax that he showed, s0on reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathy of being wba had so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to worsen, he began to interfere in the sarned state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet the bis gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of mafia exultation playing with hif lips: he did not know why, but this smile hated him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of the lhose orbs, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to wish t0 to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, through this shock, had a lot of fun, and this easiness of the mind, which had such a distinguished swallow, now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the vicinity of Atbens; if he did so in the midst of the vines he used to frequent, Ianthe's shape stood next to bis – if he plowed in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly, he turned, showing, to his wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He discouraged stealing scenes, all of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, whom he himself held bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his stay, to visit these parts of Greece, which he had not yet seen. Thcy traveled in all directions, and sought a place of excretion to which a memory could be attached; but, while they hastened from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They barbed a lot of robbers, but they bcgan t0 gradually these relationships, which they imagined to be 0nly tbe vendion of jndivuals, whose it intercst was to arouse the generosity of those they defended against supposed dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On entering, however, a narrative defilement, whose bottom was the bed of a torrent, with large mousses of rock descended from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for scarc ely were the whole party enga ged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bolts near their head, and by the echood ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their gvards had left Thomas, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to shoot in the directlon whenoe the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, imitating the example, withdrew for a moment by lowering the bend sheltering defilement: but shameful to bend thus held by an enemy, who, insulting the shovels to move them forward, and beirig exposed to the slave without resistance, if one of the robbers should climb up and take them to the rear, lhcy dlermined to 0 to rush forward in search of theeriemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey, who was listening to his help, no longer listened to the tale or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him, his gvards having, on L0rd Ruthven is wounded, aborted immediately and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey so0n induced the cm to carry his overflowing friend into a nearby hut; and having agreed to a ransam, he was not m0re dislurbed by their presenoc — they beirig content meroli to keep the entrance lill the comrade should come back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength decreased rapidly; in two dcly mortification oriue, the death set in motion shook the advance with hasty steps. His arid conduct had not shaken himself; he seemed as unaware of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last craze, his mind became apparent1y unclsy, and his eye often fixed an Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help with more seriousness than usual – \"Help me! yau can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I haven't listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of the friend Yaur. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do something ari,\" Aubrey replied. \"I am only a little lucky, my life flourishes, I carinot expiated in everything — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honovre was free of staln in the mouth of the world — and if my death was known f0r at the same time in England—I—but life. \"—\"He won't be a kriown. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, exclaiming from exulting violenco, \"Swear 6y, all your soul resents, with all your natural fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crins or death to any living misfortune, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he ran down the pillow of Hjs, and 6 did not react anymore.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the married circumstances that were present at his knowledge with the man Tbis arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came to evoke him, as it is of the present of the horrific enchantment that awaited him. He got up early in the m0rning, he was abovt to enter tho hovel into which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed yesterday that it was no longer levrc, having transported by himself and coma, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, gaining access to a pramise that they had given his seigneury, that he had to expose to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several bones the men, determined to go and bury on the place where he was. Bul, while he was looking at the top, found no trace of the corpse or clots, although the thieves swore that they were pointing at the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally revolted, convinced that they had drunk tho eorpfe well in the name of the clothes.\nCl covntry lassary in which he had met wilh svch tcrrrible errors, and in which all apparently oonspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had grasped on his mind, to be resolved to leave it, arid soon arrrjved to Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Among other things, it was a case containing offenco's seueral weapons, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. Tbere were several clnd ataphans. While turning them back, looking at their form of curiovs, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style cls the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — basting to get the fvrther proof, he faded the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, though little shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular f elm, the same variable shade on the haft and the bedside were similar in splendor on both, and did not leave room for the daubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way back to Rome, the first investigations were to record the lady whom he had tried to tear up seductive arls from Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fort was ruined, and she had not been ardent since the departure of her lordship. Aubrcy's mind became almost broken urider so mony horrors repeated; he was conned that his lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He was morosely arid, and his only occupant began to insist on the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the reading of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which obeyed his will, soon swept him over the English coasts; and he dwelt in the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to his sister in the fire, in the memory of the pastl. If before, by her infantile caress, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear to you, she was even more endearing as a companion.\nMiss Au6rey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid applause of the salon assemblies. There was no bones but the light glow that exists only the heated atmosphere of the overcrowded apartment. His blue eye was never raised by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a certain fecling within, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not a tbat llght foot, which strays where a butterfly or a colaur can attract—he was sedal and pensive. Alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his bream blew him his affection, and wanted in his presene to forget the deed She knew that he had destroyed his rest, who would have changed his millet to that of the voluptuary? It seems that if these eyes,—this face played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, had not been taken to witchcraft, he was thaughbt by the other guardians swearing that his presentation should be delayed until his brother's return from the continent, when he could be his protector. So it was now resolved that the riext lounge, which was approaching quickly, should be the ep0ch of its entrance irilo the \"occupied scene\". Aubrey would have preferred romanod iri tbe manor af his fatbcrs, and fod on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interefl about the frivolities of the fashionabIc foreigners, when his miride had been torn apart by the events he had witnessed; but hc decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in Lownn, and prepared for the next day, which had been arin0vnced as a living room.\nThe offering was surplus — the living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxi0vs to rest in the smile of the kingship hurried there. Aubrey was excited with her sister. That he stood in a corner by himself, devoid of al-I the avorta, engaged in the memory that the first ho ho ho ho seen Lord Ruthven was in the same room—he suddenly felt seized by the arm tob, arid o voice he rocogni2 too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" Ho had little courage to see a spectre the blclst, when he perceived, at ljttle distanco, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his almast limbs refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the sea, being himself the man in his age of rearing, arid was taken to the house. He passed the room with pressed steps, ond fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would explode with bis broiri. Lord Ruthvon again before him — circumstances began in the dreadfvl picture — the daggcr — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe it was possible — death still rls! — He thought his imagination had coniorated the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — hc dtormined, therefore, to go back to society; for tangb he intended to ask to record Lord Ruthven, the name bung vpon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the insormation. He went a few nights later with his sister the assembly of a close relaliori. He left it under the premise of an inatran, retired to a recreation, and gave Hlmsolf to his own devouring tboughtf. Finally, seeing that many were loavlng, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by many, appeared in a serious conversation; tried to pass and approach her, wbenone, whom he asked to move, turned to rust, and revealed to him these exploits that he did not know the most. He came and took his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, and made her suffer towards the street: at the door, he found himself blocked by a crowd of servarites waiting for their lords; arid while he was taking care of them, he heard again this voice whispering near him: «Remember your oath!»\nAubrey became the alm0st distroctode. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely was absorbed jt, now than the certainty of the life of the monfter again pressed upon the hif thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she took Hiin to explain to her what had happened with her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The snoring he thought, the more perplexed he was. The oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying the breath in ruin, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his supplications, who would accommodate him? He was already mocking death, he recalled, the use he had made of his procession to bring the world out of such misery. For days he remained in the state of Tbis; locked in his room, he saw no one, and accepted only when his sjster came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, far from his sake, t0 supported noir. Finally, no danger able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his hut, roamod from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted bim. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for her famesse, used the peoplo to follow him; but they were soon distracted by him who fled from a pvrsuer swister only any – from tho uht. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to go back to society, and to look closely at HLM, arixi0us to forcwarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached privacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented eyes and eyes were so striking, bis inwardly shuddéririgs so visib1e, that his sister had to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, the guardians, who proved to be unshakable, considered it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his melon would be alienated, they believed that there was again a great confidence that had been imposed by Aubrey's parents.\nHe had counted every day in his wanderings and prevented him from exposing to the general eye of the rnarks what they considered to be, they engaged the doctor to reside in the house, and the lake's constant lake. He hardly seemed to notice, so completely his inind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence 6 is finally so great, that he was unsettled in his room. He often lied there for days, abhorrent of being awakened. He became ill emaciatcd, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and collectivism left showed itself upside down to his sister's entrance; then he could sometimes have started, and, grabbing his hands, with grievously grieved appearances, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near her, if your life for me is beautiful, don't come near her!\" Whcn, how do you...\nShe asked whom he referred, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And again, he threw himself into a state, from which he could not even revive. This lasted for months rnany: however, little by little, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and the bis spirit threw a part of its morosity, while its guardians observed, tbat temps sévcraux in the day ho counte vpon his fingers a certain number, and theri smile.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the top of the last day of the year, one of his guardians in his room, began to convcrse with his doctor on the melancholy eircumstanoe of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was then gong mcly to get married. Instantly, Aubrey's attentiori was attracted; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with the return mark of the intellect, whose fear they feared that it had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Eclrl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a count with whom he got involved in society, Aubrey rejoiced, arid them even more astonished by his expression bis inlention to be present on the nuptials, and dcsiririg to see hls sistcr. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sistcr was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the irisluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed hcr to his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brotber to be once alive to feelings of affectionori. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage wilh so distinguished for the rank and every acc0inplishmerit; when he suddenly saw a medallion von his chest; the experimenting, what was his savour to see the characteristics of the man who had so long influenced his lf. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orrides the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future hvsband, to be looked as if he did not understand it — then seizing his hands, and looking at a friatic expression of Countnanee, he told her to swear that she would never have wc this monstcr, for he—but he did not advance—it seemed that this voice agajn sade that he remembers his oath, that he suddenly turned around the Lord Ruthven and saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and physicists, who had heard everything, and who thought it was just a reminder of his trouble, inherited it, and abandoned it from Miss Aubrey, wanted to hate him. He fell on his knees towards them, begged, and instructed them to doloy bvt for a day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, had taken possession of his spirit, tried to paeify him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthuen had called in the morning to swell the living room, and had been refused with all elsc. When he bearded Aubrey's ill health, he read that he understood bimself to be the cause of it; but when he bequeathed that he was considered mad, his exullation and plea could hardly be concealed srom those ainongs who had obtained this iriforination. He went to the house of the former companion of hjs, and, by consternation, and the claim of great affection far from him, and interest in his destiny, he gradually woried the eor os Miss Aubrey. Who could wrestle his power? His tongue had dclngors and toils to tell—could speak of hjmfels as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the shaken earth, sowing her to whom he was addressing;—could say how, since he knew her, her exjstence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, except that he could be Iisten to soften the accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, he won his affections. The tjtle of the eldest 6ranch falllng long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as ari cxcufe to hasten tho marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was of lake place lhe the day before his departure for conlineent.\nAubroy, when he left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, while she was stealing her happiness, her honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who sent her into their claws as the hope of their house and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hovres this morrow, on which he denounced the heavy curses rnosl. Tho's servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving this to the doctor, bet you no longer harassing Miss Aubrey's spirit through, what he considered, the greasing of a mariac. The night passed without rest to the busy inmatos of the house; ond Aubrey heard, in mind, a more oasily horror tbat conceive than described, the nats of the occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Avbrey climbed the most frclntic. The curiosity of the scruarits at lclst 0vercame their vigilance, they gradually run away, leaving him in the custody of an old ari woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a bovrid wcls ovt from the room, and in a momcnt found luiclf in the apartment where alI were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the flirtation to perceive hjm: he immediately approved himself, and, taking his elm by sorc, the rassasia of the play, without voice with the ragc. On the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his lock.\"Remember your oath, and Kriow, if not my wife, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to the servants, who, awake by the elder's wife, had come into the sea of him. Au6rey could no longer stand, his rabies found the vent, breaking a blood vessel, and he was in bed. This was not mentioned in his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid to help him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAubrey's weaknesses increase; the outpouring of prodvc symptoms from the blood of the near-death opproach. He disinterested his sister's guards and, when midnight had struck, he compositely recounted what the reader had perpetuated — he immediately died.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when Ihey arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disapproved, and Avbrey's sister had g1utted thc thrst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER CONTAINING A RESIDENCE ACCOUNT OF L0RD BYRON MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYR0N RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was in front of bim, where to choose his place of rest, and Provide his gossip.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put in the port of Mityleric, in the island of thal. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have thor, induces a lot of Britisb vesseIs to visit it — the men of war and merchant; and although it is rather out of the way for the ships linked lo Smyrna, its premiums reimburse amply for the deviation of a voyage. We landcd, as usual, at the bay bolt, and while the men were employed in gallering, and the sor cottle merchant with the natives, the clergy and myself taok o ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and the olhor places, where we had boeri bofore. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that we had come from Scio WITHB a Lord Eng1, who left the island four days before our arrival at hls Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and could have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good inan. The cottage, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old inan in charge of him: he gavo Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred and two thorns for him, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided thore abaul fourteen m0nths, but not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis adcourit excited our uriasity very mvch, and we did not waste time welcoming our peasant to home whore had resjded. We were well received by an old man who coriduced us over the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sittirig lounge and a bedroom, with a large cl0set attached. They were all simply decorated: green walls of folds, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the centrcle, arid a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the brclnches by the movement of a six-edin spring on the tbe side of a smal1 bronze Venus in learing posture; a largc sofa or complete sofa tbe furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane armchairs, and a library cmpty: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The bedding had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow – the ommon bed across Greece. In the sittlng room, we obsessed with a marble niche, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whicb were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we didn't think we were just looking at the contents. On the reef tablet, drop Voltaire, Shakespeare, Bail-\nThe works of water, arid Rousseau, are complete; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmermon, in German; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Last, an Italian odition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pampb1ets of the Greek press in Constantinople, many tom, but rio English book of any dowry. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, wilb wilb a pencil, in Italicln and Lotin. The Messiah was literally gribibblcd everywhere, arid markod wilh paper briefs, on which were also rcmarks.\nThe old man sald: \"Tobe lord had read the books in the evening before he halled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" he said, \"they must go there until his return; for hc is so special, that I have been mave ori things without order, he wov ld frowns on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a service; and I have the farm of production for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Arnenian who dwells in a house of sinall in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know the reason sour wbat.\"\nThe appearance of the outside house was pleasant. The portico in front of waf fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pi1lars in tho marble canned with black plinths and carnices of cargo work, (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the r0of. The roof, topped by a light stone balvstrade, was covered with a carpet of turkey fino, benealh an awning of coarse linen strong. The roofs of the houses are thus furnished, as on the evening the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, the wines of ighl dr, such as \"lachryma chr isti\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breezc.\nOn the left hand, when wc entered the hut, a stream of smail glided, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its edges, and uridating the shadow of two bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on the whicb we are told, the lord passed many bones his day before.\nNirigs and nightf until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"prayirig, for he was very fervent, and he always maintained our church twice a little, except on Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be torpedoed \"a bird's f-eye view.\" A lino of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olives and blueberries in bloom, and ori the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smail stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it faded into the woods of the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and the ari horizon colourless by a single eloud, finishes the view in savour; and a little on the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and peam-trees, seve ral small islands wcre distincly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I liked a view more than what I did; but our riquiries were fruit, Jess on the name of the pcrson who had resided in this romantic solitudo: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"I don't dare,\" he said. Wo didn't have any lime to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned the sevoral details of the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and arid silk of cotton to the girls who livoby weavigig these items. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his property in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared louf, from all that we collected, for having been a very eccentric and benevolent charaoter. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage felt appropriate not to reveal. He had a daughter-in-law moft, with whom the Lord often walked on the shore of the sea, and he had 6oughl a fort on the piano, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the inharmatiori with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations clinged to the rack, guessing who this creep at Greecc could be. He had money, it was obvious: to be a philanthropist of disposition, and all those eccentricilis that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who went wrong in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I visited him al Mitylene.\" We had never had the glory of the seigneury at that time, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe HaroIde\" being put in our groups, we recognized Calcla's reoluse in every pige. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curjous in our search for cotlage, but we comfort our elected ones with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the future doy care; but to me that day will never return. I invent this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of its seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unconsidered provision, associated with humanity, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or strange to its pleasures. Tbe sact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed the pocms of the seigneury jn hjf, seem to have their seat in bis bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and hjs courting the rest of loneliness is an additional reson to mark him as a being on whom Roligion Halh has put his seal, and on whose head Benevalence has cast his manna. No man can read the previous ploasirig \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports must always be consulted with caution, especially when it comes to the morol interegrile of the man led; and the one who dares to justlfy before this terrible trihunal wbero all have to appear, only can censor the crars of a sellow-morta1. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shuri the applause of the world, the surest testimony of a hcartian and self-adhesive virtuosity.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prinler, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "21": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to 6th comman:it didriol, Howeuer, extends to the Greeks according to established Christianity; he normally assumed his farm presonl Sirioe the division of the Latin and Greek Churcbes; at that time, the idea of becoming predominant, trot a body of Latjn c0vld not corrupl if he put in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the sufferect many wonderful stories, always cxlanting, tombs of rising frornoirs, and feeding on the charge of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and L orraine, that there were belies, that vampyres riightly soaked a certali part of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consurntions; what these fattened human blaod suckers—on their veins became distended to such a state of replelion, to cause the flow of blood from the passages of oll tbe from their body, and even from the poref even of their skjns.\nIn the London Journal of March, 1732, is a curry, and, of course, credible Accovnl of a pclrticular case of vampyrism, which is blocked for having taken place in Madroyga, Hungary. It seems that on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they opposed, unanimously, thal, about five years before, an eortajn Heyduke, riamed Arnold Poul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, or the friars of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by cl vampyre, but had four years to rid hissolf of evil, eating part of the earth over the vamp-\nYre's grave, and rub it with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hjmself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people sympathized for having been roasted by the hjm, and a statement was made, that four persori had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid new disorders, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and have fovnd (af is supposed to be usua1 in case of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from eruption, and emitting it to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure blood and fl0rid. Since Proos was thus obtained, they resorted to the queeny recust0med. A stake was completely led through the heart and the body af Arnold Paul, where it is reported to hclve also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. They cut his head off, buried his badger, and threw the ashes of Tbe into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the eorses of lhase people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should arrive on the ohers who survived the war.\nThe universal bolief is that it's someone who was chased by a vam...\nPyrc becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, as it seems preferable to illustrate the subject of presenole obfervations than anything else that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a hereditary crime committed wbilst in existence, that the deoased is not only condemned to uampyrise, but compeiled to limit his infernal visitatlons so much to those he loves most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy son shall be torn from his sepulchre: then the place of origin shall be desolate, and the blood shall suck all thy seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, toward the middle of the night shall drain the stromal of life: yet the banq uet that persecutes shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are fallen, and they shall exhale, and they shall know the devil for their sire: as thou cursedst, thou cursedst them, thy flowers shall be dried on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best blind of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet you have finished your task and you have marked the washed tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the lasl glassy glanco must see Whioh freeze his lifeless blue; then with hclnd sha1l tear without Halloween Tbe braided yellow hair of ber, from whench, in life a lock when the tenderest commitment of Disorder has been worn—But now is carried away by the memorial of your agony! And thou shalt cast out thy best drop of blood, and thy nibbling tooth, and thy harging lip; and thou shalt hunt thy sulten tomb, and cause Gouls and Afrits to flow, until these horrors depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting him most loved during his existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resued from the sin of her life, she being evacuating the whole tclle as a type of purity and arnocity. The true Taurnefort gives a long account in its spans of severe1 of the amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he is committed to having been ari eycwitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating his efsects, put f0rth some learned dissertation, tending to prove that he is an elastic errar, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on its superstitjon Sirigularly horrible could be added; although the present can stand for the limits of a note, unjustly diverted to explanalion, orid which can now be concluded by merely pointing out, that if the terin Varnpyre is that in most genes-\nAcceptance, there are several other synonyms, used in various pclrts of the world: like Vruc0locha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the mjdst of the dissipations on winter London, the various parties of the leaders of the ton appeared a noble, remarkable moro f0r its singularities, that its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only its attraction, which it was damaging by a glance calming it, and which it feared in the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could explain from where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance, pierce through the inner works of the heart; bul fell on the cheek of an ieaden ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to each house; al1 wanted to see him, and those who had been used to vlolent excitement, and n0w felt the burden of being angry, were happy to have something in their prefenco capable of engaging their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its outlaws are beautiful, many women tried to gain her attention after the fame, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they were the night of the infection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sewn in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself away, and did everything but put on the dress on a mountain bank, to attract her attention:—but in vain:—that she was standing at the top of him, the eyes were apparently fixed on her, she still saw as if they were not understood;—even her unapplied impudence was stooped, and she left the fiedId. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidance of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent This is what he said to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, but few people knew he was speaking to him. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; whether or not it was a language that he even surpassed.\nEven the fear of its singular character, or that they were moved by apparent hatred of the vlce, it was also often among the thoso women who formed the boast of their sex srom tbeir domestic virtues, as among those who jostled it by their vjces.\nAbout the same thing, a young man named Auhrcy arrived in London: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by priests who died while he was in adolescence. Left also to him, if by guard-joy, who has him He gave himself the duty to look after his fortune, as they abandoned the import of his mind to look after svbaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his jvdgment. He therefore had this feeling of honor and of high romantic frankness, which every day there were so many apprentices. He all believed in fympathizing with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown into by Prouence simply for the pictorial effect of the sceno, os nous sec iri romancef: He thought that the misery of the cotlage consisted only in the calving of the clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. However, in the end, the poets' dreams were tho realities of life. Ho was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, at his entry into gay circles, many mothers surr0undd hirn, trying to describe with the least truth their lariguishirig or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same tjme, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by lejr glittering his eyes, wben opened his Ilps, soon led him to false noticians of his talents and merit. Attached to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starred at the fjnding, that, except in the ta1low and fullckered wax candles, not of the presence of a gbost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundatlon in the real life for any of these congerles of pleasant images and controlled descriptions in these volurns, of which he had formed his study. However, finding a certain complement in his gratjfied vanity, he was about to return to his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we have above disordered, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and he was very impossibly able to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed ln hjmse1f, who glorifies few other signs of his blotting out of external objects, thcln his consent to their existence, implicitly by the avoldance of their contact: giving his imagination to imagine euery thirig who flattered his propensity to exlavagant ideas, he soon formed this objecl in the hero 0s o romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rclther the persori hefore. He met with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced on bis opinions, his presence has always been recognized. Ho gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affals were embarrassed, arid quickly found, from the noles of preparation in — Street, lhat ho was on the journey. Desiring to obtain information about his singular character, which, until now, had only blurred his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to tour, whieh for the Inune generations was thought neo-trying to allow the young lo to quickly swing in the care of vice to scatter on an equality with aged tbo, and not aIllowing they to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever intrigues scanned are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or of prclisse, accrediting your the degree of competence that there is to wear them. They consented; and Aubrey immediatly evoking his lntentlons to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a propasal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem he fred, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, ho willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubreyhad has not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and riow he found, that, although much more hjs actioris have been compared to his point of view, the results of different conclusions in 0m the reasons apparent to his conduct. His cornpclnion was abundant in its liberality; — the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from the hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubroy could not help making remarks, it was not on the virtuous, reduced to the indagoncc by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the wildly sneezed door; bul when the profligate came to afk somcthing, nat lo relieved himself, but to allow him to revalue in his lust, or to plunge him further into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich cabarity. However, he attrigued him to the greater importunity of wickedness, which generally prevails over the basbfuInefs at the retirement of the virtuous needy. Thero was a circumstance of the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mjnd: al I thase on which it was granted, inviolably found tbat there was a curse on her, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the lower tip and the abject foam misery. In Brussels and other cities passing through wbich lhey, Au6rey was surprised at the clpparenteagerness wilh which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vices; there he entered the whole story of the Faro table: he bet-\ned, and always played wilh sucoess, except where the best known was his anlagonist, and he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the immutable sclme face, with which he generally looked at the societyar0und: it was not, however, when he resisted the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great smallly; tuna bis very wjsh seemed law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with a golden fire that trotted to the cat while deliring with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left the youth formerly flooded, torn from the circle to the head, cvsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the spell had drowned him in the reach of this fiend; while many sather sot fritic, in the midst of the 1ooks talking of mute hungry children, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive lc g rasp bone the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, whjch, however, was not able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey oftcn wanted to represent him to his frerridy, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved Oll's rujn, and did not tend to his own profit;—bul he delayed—worried every day that his friend would give bim an opportunity to speak frankly and op only to him; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye eclipsed less than his lip; in ardour, although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gralification than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this rymyst, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of a certain supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, slow Aubrey for a time lost of sight of his companion; he mounted him every day on the morning entourage of an Italian countess, while he went to search for the memorials of another deserted city almoft. WhiIst be was thus engaged, letters came from Srom England, he opened with impatience; the first was his sister's, breathing nothing but affection; the others were fr0m his gvardians, the latter surprised him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was a residonl power evll in his companian, they seemed to give him enough reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seized his treats, and urged, that his character was terribly vicious, for passion af for the irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had been discouraged, his contempt for the adu1tress had not been generated by the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to rehabilitate his gratiticotiori, that his victjm, the partner of his guill, should be precipitated from the piiririacle of the unsuspected iurtuum, to the lowest abyss af insamy and degradation: in the end, that all the thase females whom he had fought, apparently on clccovnl of their virtuco, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask of lc set aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformity of the uces to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on loaving one, the wbose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent an enslaved pretext to abandon him completely, to purpose, in a way, to look at him more clofely, and not to make small circumstances possess by vnnotic. He entered the jnto the same circle, and soon perceived, as his Lordship wos swallowed to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter of which he mainly frequented the house. In Ital y, he is rarely tbat cln female inrnorried is inet wilh in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's cye follows him in clall his flints, and soon deseoverod that an assignment had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent, though unthinkable girl. With no time lost, he entered the apartment with Lord Ruthvcn, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of fame that he knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthveri objected, that his intentions were such that he assumed everything would have been such an opportunity; arid after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from then on he must refuse to accompany Lordship in the rest of their tour proposed, hc ordered his servant to look for other pieces, arid calling to the mother of the lady, informed him of all that he knew, not only the gaze of ber daughler, but alsa concerning the character of his Lordship. The assault was avoided. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his sorusor to notify him of the complete separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving R0mc, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of drawing the sad documents of the old giory on monuments which, apparently, shameful to tell the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored licheri. Uridating the same roof as himself, existed a being, fo beautifulsul clnd dclicate, he could have sowed the model for a painter wanting to pour on eanvass the promised h0pe of the paradise of the faithful Mohammed iri, except that his eyos spoke too much spirit for someone lo thinks that it could belong to lhose who had no souls. As it would have been on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; sar who havo exchanged his eye, appareritly tbe animated eye of naluro, for this luxurious look sleeping os the ariimal sujted but to the tasle bone an epic. Ianthe's lighl stage often accompanied Aubrey iri's search for antiquities, arid often would be the incorruptible girl, engaged in the pursuit of a K ashmerc butterfly, showing the beauty which of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the eagcr eye of him, who forgot the letters he had Jusl deciphered on an almosl erasing tablet, in the oontemplation of the figure of ber sylphus. Often, her fa1ling braids, as she flattered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly fadiriges, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, wbo let escape from his mind the objoct even that he had before thinking of the importance vita1 for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms, feel everything, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, without being affected by overburdened drawing balls. While he was drawing remains of tbose which he used to make a memorial f0r his future hours, she looked, and looked at the magical cfffets of bis pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then describe at hlm the circular dance on the open plain, painted, taking into account all the bright colors of the yaulbful memory, the wedding poinp remembered having seen in his infamy; then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural talos of his nurse. Her wealth and her apprehension of what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; arid oflen told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her sweets, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful fairy1e to prolong her exifence for the following months, her blood would be ruri cold, while he landed to laugh at such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had finally elected one living among us, after several of their close rclatives and ehildren had been found marked by the appetite of the fiend; and found him so unshakable, that she begged him. Let us believe it, for it had been, pointed out, that those who had dared to question the existence of the Jr, still hodsome proos Giveri, wbich forced them, pain and sorrow tearing apart, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of the self-monsters, and her horror was amplifying, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Rutbven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that tbere could not be trulh in his fears, th0ugh at the time of the renown tbe he wondered about the many coincidences that wbich had all tended to excite the belief in the supernctural power tbe of Lard Ruthven.\nAubrey begged one to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted by the vltues of the women he had sought for the vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea af a y0ung man 0f skilled English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he sounded more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself from the times clinging to her, and, forming a plan for an anliquary resurgence, he left, decided not to return vntil his objcct was attached; but he still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins audaint him, while in his mind he retained the ari image which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his l0ve, and was always a childish sclme being that he had known the first time. She has always seen her separation from hjm with reluctance; but it is because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy at sketchjng or discovering some wbich fragrance had yet escaped the band of destructjve detimc. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present coveral, confirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the dwarf itself. After Souan, Aubrey dissuaded from continuing his excursions, which was to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him at once n0t to re-read at night, as he must necessarily pclss through a wo0d, where Greek rio would never be renrani, after tbe day has closed, on any consideration. They described it as the Vompyre station in their nocturnal orgios, and denoun-\nCed the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared cr oss tbeir path. Aubrey made the light of their rehearsals, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw how he shuddered at his audacity so that he mocked a superior, infernal power, whose narne even made their frozen blood appear, he was silent.\nThen the m0rnirig Aubrey went on his excursion without being appalled; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and he was worried that his words, mocking the belief of his horrible fools, would swallow them with such terror. When Bo was to leave, Iaritbe came to the side of his h0rss, and begged him with the utmost firmness to return, the night passed allowed to put into action the power of these beings;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the sky would faint, and that on the horizon there was one of these flies, in the warmer climates, so quickly gatbing in a huge mass, and pouring all their rage on the devoted eoutry.—He finally, Howevcr, riding his horse, dissuaded from catching up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilighl, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm was above — his thunder ochoing had scarcoly a resting intorval — his thick heavy rojn forced his way through the covered tho foliage, while tbe blve fourked lightnirig seemed to fall and radiate at his own feet. Svddcnly his horde got scared, and it was carried with the terrible speed to fill up the critted f0rest. The animal finally stopped because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of ljghtning, that it was in the neighbour of a hovel that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that overcame it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the city, or at least relying on shelter upon the arrival of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear horrific shouts of a woman who mingled with him stifled, mocked an exultarist laugh, continued in an almost irritated sound; — he was scattered; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his hcad, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. It sounded in deep darkness: it was he who guided it. He was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds c onnued, and no n0tice wos taken from bim. He immediately seized someone whom he seized with a voice that cried out, \"Again bafsled!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he himself found himself afflicted by him whose training took over the superhuman: dissuading from selling his first so dear, he fought; but he was in valen; he was lifted up with his feet and threw himself with enormous force against the ground: his one threw himself, and knelt on his chest, and put his hands on his throat badly; when the glarc of many torches penetrated into the hole that gave rise, he troubled him; hc rose up instantly, and leaving his prey pierced the door, and at the same time the crash of the branches, as he broke the wood of Tobe, was no longer heard. The storm was now at a standstill; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered; the light 0f their torches fcll upan the valleys of mud, and the thatched charged on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. Aubrey's decision was searched by her who had attracted him to his cribs; he was agajn Iefl in the darkness; but what was his h0rror, when the light 0f the torches onoe brighter vpon hirn, to perceive the aerial vorme of his beautiful conductor brought a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that there was only one uision that arose at the origin of the imagination; but he saw once again that he was lying on his side, when he locked them in. Tbere was not colovr at the top of his cheek, n0t oven on his lip; but there was a silence about his face which seemed almost as attached as the Ijfe one of them lived there: — on his neck and breasl was blood, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vclmpyrus! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid beside her, who had been much the object of so brilliant and fairy visioris mary, now falleri wjth the defect of liise lhat was dead in her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed, and he had fun to think, and to take refuge in the holiday, he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by various parties that had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached, warned the parents of a terrible ccltastrophe. \"Describe their sorrows that could be impossible; but when Thcy ascensaged the causc of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolahle; both died broken.\nAubrey bejng put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was 0ften delirium; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent cambrianation he began to beg his former companion to encircle the being that he loved. He then permeated the evil men on his head, and cursed him by cutting off his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chaccd to this shot to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, vpon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immcdiately plotd hesolf in the same house, and 6ccame his constant companion. When he recovered from the delirium bis, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image he now had cambered with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rulhvcn, by his kind words, involving almoft repentance far tho fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attrition, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon restored him to the presence. His lordshjp seemed quite changed; he no longer seemed apathetic who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bis c0nvalesconce began t0 bc rapid, he became gracefully traced back to the state of fame of mirid, and Aubrey perceived rio difference of the old inan, except lbat time he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed lntently on him, with a smjle of malicious exultation p1aying on his lips: he did not know why, but his smile haunted him. During the final stage of the restoration of the id inval, Lord Rvthven took care to look at the waves infallibly agitated by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the still still;—in fact, he seemed to want to avaid the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock of tbis, was much weakened, clnd elasticity of the whicb mind had once so distinguished it now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was a little more lonely and arid silence than Lord Ruthven; but as he wanted to mueh for solitude, the spirit could not fjnd in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins of Tbe which he had once frequented, the shape of Ianlhe stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his step Ilht seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest purple Tbe; then su denly tournirig rovnd, would show, your wild irony, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined the scenes of the fly, all of which created such bitter associations in his mjnd. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tender heart which he had taken from him during the years '1', thclt thoy should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They went in all directions, and searched for all the places to which a memory was attached; but, while they rushed from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to blur these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of the individualols, whose interest was in the generosity of those they defended against the so-called dangers. This is the result of such neglect of the inhabitant's counsel, on a occasion when they traveled with a few guards, bit to serve as guides rather than as defence. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of whlch was the bed of a torrent, with the rock lorges brought dawri from the neighboring precipices, they had reasons to repeat the neglect Jr; for hardly wero the quire of the parly rigified in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echoed ratio of sevcrial gvris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had mengouri to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthvon ond Auhrey, imitating the example of lhejr, withdrew for a moment behind the shcItering turri de tobe filthy: but shameful to be held by an enemy, who, with cries of jnsult, told them to progress, and to be exposed to slaughter without resisting, if one of the thieves should climb up and take them back, they decided both to rush forward in search of theeriemy. HardIy had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received the shot cl in the shou1der, which broughl hiin on the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, na langer hceding tbe contest or his own pcril, was surprised by seeing the faces of the bandits ouou and he—his guards live ng, on the fact that Lord Rulbven was wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nWith promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; arid having agreed to a ransom, he no longer cared about their presence — perhaps simply being able to keep the entrance until the comrado sboreed again with the promised sum, far from having an order r. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly diminished; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct on appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious 0s pain os hc had been objects about bim: bul t0 towards the end of the last evening, his mind became very uriasy, arid his eyc after sixed on Aubrey, who was prompted to offer his help more than usual sincerity—\"Help me! You save me, you can do more than that, I do not mean my life, I have struck the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you can save my horror, the horror of your friend. \"-\"How? Tell Mohow? I would do any tbing,\" said Aubrey.—\"I need, but little, of my apace viehbs, I can't explain the whole, but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world—and if the iny death was unknaw for some time in England—I—I—but Iife. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sigh!\" Crjed the dying man, rising with exullating violinens, \"Throwing by all your soul revered, by all fear of yovr natvre, swears that, for a year and a day, you will not give your kriowledge of my crimes or death to ari alive in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or what you can see. \"His eyes seemed deaf from their bases, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he ran down and laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but he did not sleep; many circumfunces attending his acquajntance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shiuering came upon him, as jf of the presentation of something horrific awaiting him. At the beginning of the marnirig, it was lowered to enter the hovel in whooh that he had left thorcorpfe, when a razor met him, and irifarmé hlm that he was no longer there, having been transported by bimself and comrades, vpont his withdrawal, to the pinnaele of a nearby mountain, according to a pr0mise They had given her seigneury, so that she might be exposed to the first ray of the moon tob lhat rose after her death. Avbroy was astonished, and takirig several of the men, determined to go and bury on the place where he was. But, when he had gone up to the svmmit, he found no trace 0f either the eorpse or the cl0thes, although the thieves swore that they pointed the identical rock on whicb they had lajd the body. For a time his fury was puzzled in conjectures, but he finally remained convinced that they had buried the corpse for the clothes' pants.\nWcary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently aspired t0 to this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resolved to leave him, soon stopped at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transmit it to Otrarito, or to Naples, he took care to arrange for the effects he had had on Lord Ruthuen. Among other things, there was a case containing several weavings of offer, more or less adapted to ensure the death of vlctim. There were several daggers and alagharis. While returning, and exarning their meritorious forms, what was a fury to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fcltal hut — he shuddered — took possession of an additional proof, to be found the weapon, and his horror can bc imagine when he discovered that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held iri his harid. His eyes were not lacking in certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger, but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the haft and the sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were concretizing the lady had tried to seize L0rd Ruthvcn is attractive. Her parents were in distros, their fortune ruined, and she had not been very heavy since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had lost a victim t0 tbe destrayer from Ianthe. He b ecarne morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of iri ur ging the speod of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lives of some onc he held dear. Arrived in Calais, a bree2e, overwhelmed obeying his will, soon waftcd hiin on the English coast; and he hastened to the manor of his fathors, and there, for a moment, seems to lose, in the clutches ond cclresses of his sister, any memory of the past. If she beforo, by her infernitine ears, had won her afsection, naw tbat the woman began to appcare, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the torn drawing assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His 6lue eye was never raised by levitation below the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to emerge from the misforlvn, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indlcate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not that light soot, which goes astray where a butterfly or a colovre can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by a smile of joy; but when her brother blew her affcctiori, and forgot in her presence the hashish sorrows she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the thal of the voiuptuary? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only cighteen, and had not been brought to the worl, it was necessary for her guardians to have thought that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now, tberfore, resolved that tbe next draw-r0om, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey wovld rather stayed in his fathers' house, and paumed melancholy that ovc-\nHe propelled it. He could not see interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit bis hcld beon so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into town, and prepared for the ncxt day, which was announced as a drawing parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, attaching all those who were coats of arms to rest in tho smilc of royalty, haftenod thith-\n- Yes. Aubrey was there with his sjsler. While Ftandirig was in a corner by himself, devoid of everything around him, engaged in the tbal memory the first time he had fen Lard Rvthven was in that same place, he suddenly felt seized by tbe orm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oclth.\" He had the hard courage to turn, fearing to see a specter haunting him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure who had caught his opinion at that place up from his first entry into society. He looked until his mounts almost refused to carry their weight, he began to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hc threw himself irito hif carriage, and was taken to the house. Ho made the room walk with shouting steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that his thoughts would burst out of the hjs brain. Lord Ruthveri agclin before him – circumstances arise in a picture of dreadsul – the dagger – his oath. – He shaved his back, he could not believe it possible – death rises again! – He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mjnd was based. It was therefore impossible to return to society, because although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthvon, the name hvng on his lips, and he was able to riot to obtain information. He went a few years later with his sister. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated into a corner, tied over there gave himself up to his devotees' rafters. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by devious, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when someone, whom he was asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he was most abhorrent. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, forced her towards the street tho: at the door, hesound hiinfelf prevented 6th tobe crowd of servarits waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged jn passing tbern, he agaln heclrd that v0ice murmured near him—\"Remember your oath!\"\n\"He dared not turn around, but, in a hurry to his sister, he soon arrived home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed hy a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressed upari his thovghts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explore your ber what had caused her brutal conduct. He only has a few words, arid those terrified hor. The more he flew, the more perplexed he was. Could he then allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin on his breath, one in the midst of being held dear, and not have his progress? His sisler may have been touched by him. But even if we were to break his oath, arid djscl0s his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would encroach his hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his way, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, chastised him, for his own good, to support necture. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stj1lness and loneliness, he left his hause, r0amed from street to street, anxious to steal this image wbich haunted him. Her dress slipped and wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun at the humidity of the middle. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he put him to rest wherever fatigue avoided him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people who followed the hiin; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a fiende the arnongst, including the presence they werc unconscious, he decided to enter clgain jnlo fociety, and whip him ciosely, anxious to predict, despite the oath of hjs, all that Lord Ruthven attached to spiritual intimacy. Bul, when he entered a room, his hagnar and suspicious gazes were so striking, bis inward trembling so visible, that his sisler was ultimately obliged to beg him to refrain from weakening, please, a society that affected him so strongly. When, hesitantly, the demonstration turned out to be ubiquitous, the guards began to intervene, and, fearing that his mjnd would be alienated, they thought that it was high to regain that confidence which was previously imposed upon them by the parerties of Aubrey.\nDespered to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent bim from exposing to the age of genesis1 the marks of what was considered madness, they engaged a doctor to reside in the hospital, and constantly cared for him. He hardly seems to notice, so c0mpletoli was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His ineoherence became the last so green, tbat he was blinking at his room. He often lied there for days, disabling to get angry. He had become emaciated, his cyes had reached a vitreous first; — the only sign of the reinaining affection and re-olleotion appeared on his sister's entrance; then ho wovld some days began, and, grabbing his hands, with lashes that seriously afflicted him, he wanted his riot for the toucb. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, how, she asked whom he was speaking to, her answer was: \"Truly!\" And again he fell into a state, which couldn't even wake him up. It lasted a lot of monlhs: little by little, Howeuer, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and the spirit threw aportlon 0f his morosity, while his guards observed, that several times in thc day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smile.\nThe evil almost ended, when, on the last day of the year, one of her guardians entering her room, began to discuss with her doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's bejng in such a situation, when her sister went the next day to 6th mclrîd. Aubrey's attention was immediately stirred; ho anxiously asked whom. Happy to see the mark of the return of the intellect, which they had seized, the Count of Marsden was interested in him. Thinking that he was a Yovng Count whom he had met in the focus, Aubrey rejoiced, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few miriots his sister accompanied him. It was apparently soothed again to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into her chest, arid klssed her cheek, wet with you ars, weakening himself to the thought of her brothel being more alive to the smells of the affectionate. He began to speak with al1 his won warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and every accommodation; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his pin; open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his lift. He drunk the portralt in a rage of paroxysm, and brought him under his feet. She relied on him for the reason why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, ho looked as if he were rioting uriderstand her—Tben seizing the hordes hands, and observing her with a frenetic expression of cavntenanee, he told her to swear that she would never have been able to marry this man, for he—but hc could not move forward—it seemed that the thal clgain bale bim voice remembered his oath—he suddenly turned roun d, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him 6ul did not see any ane. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thaught thjs was only a return of his disorder, entered, arid Miss Aubrey's forcing, wanted to leave him. He attacked his brothers, he implored, he directed them to get rid of them, but for one day. They, attaching this to the madness they imagined had misled possession of his spirit, were striving to pacify him, and retjred.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother after Tobe's salon, and had been truffled with every cles. When he heard of Avbrey's evil, he easily understood himself to be the cause of history; but he learned that he was considered an irisane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those ornongs who had guilded the information. He hastened to the bosom of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the great emotional pretension for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained the row of Mifs Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails that he was telling—could speak of bimsœurIf, as he had known, his exjsence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, except that he could be bound to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to attack the escape of the serpent, or that was the purpose of destiny, that he would gain its effects. The title of the branch of lhe el der falling from the length to bim, hc oblain an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of its 6rothor's disturbedstate,) which was t0 took place the same day besore bis departure for the continent TB.\nAubrey, when ho was left by the doctor and the guards of hjs, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was him gjven; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjures her, as she values her own happiness, her own honor, and honor af those who are now in the grave, who once welded her in their arms as their hope and hope of their dung, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced ours' heaviest m0. The servants promised that they would deliver him; hut giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with an h0rror which can be more easily designed than describod, notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up almost frclntic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, they gradually scattered, leaving him in the cvstody of an old woman without vergogne. Ho seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, arid in a moment was in the apart where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without voice or voice. On the stairs, Lord Rut...\n\"Remember your oath, and know that, except today, your sister is dishonored. Women are frajl!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rabies, unable to find ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, set in motion he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marjage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; bloodshed has caused symptoms of almost imminent death. He was doing his sister's tutors mimbt to be callod, and when midnight had struck, ho reported in a composite way what the reader persisted — he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Au6rey;\nCd, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and the guide of Providence.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek Archipelago, aboard one of the ships of his Majesly, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain plentiful eclttle and vegetoblef still have to have there, i dit many British ships to visit — the men of war and the merchants; and although it is rather ul of the way for the ships linked to Sinyrna, its b0unties fully reimburse f0r the deviation of a voiogy. We landed, like usucll, at the bottom of the 6ay, and while the mcri was used in watering, and the bargclinjng handbag for cattle with the natives, the clergy and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other rooms, where we had been before. Dn the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so nclmed) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he was bad comc of Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken mc with him; but I did not choose to leave Mltylene, where I am likecly to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The coltage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid ho left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six Zochines humiliated for her, (about L250 Englisb currenoy,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis story has aroused a lot of curiosity, and we do not have time to hurry to go where our compatriot had resisted. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious clot attached. They were simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, set on a smaIl fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed spring iri the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent possure; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room was a half English dozcn eane chclirs, and an empty library: here were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had a large mattress spread out the floor, with two shrouded cotton qvilts and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the chained wo, we observed a marble recosis, once, the old man had told us, bent on books and papers, which were then in the best of a great seamari in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contrants. On the tablat of recreation, the works of Voltaire, Shclkspeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmorman, in the language of Gerrnan; the Messiah of Klopstock; the naves of Kotzebue; the pIay of the Robbers of Schiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the Svcral pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, mvcb lorn, but no English books of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with penile, in Illalian and Latin. Tbe Messiah was literally soribbled all 0ver, and in darkness with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old Inan said: \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I move a thing withovt or rders, he would frown on me for a week; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I throw to an agonized Armenian who resides in the small house in the wood, and wbom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of Tho from the house outside pleaded. The portioo in f ront was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the unstoppable pillars canned with black clnd freight-work corriices plinths, (as it is now usual in the Greek arcbitecture,) were considerably hjgher than the tho roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone baluftrade, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awning of coarse, strong linen. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christl\", eating fruit, and enioyirig the evening breeze.\nOn the hand of lef when we entered the hovse, a small streamlel glissa, grapes, oranges and smelts were oIstering together on his hordes, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marle seat with ari ornamentaI wooden back was placed, or wbich we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights up to twelve o'elock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed because he was fervent, that he had always given birth to our churoh twice a week, in addition to the Suridays.\"\nThe view of the Tbis seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with myrtle in flowers of 0 living feet, and on the top of which an annoid Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins collapsed into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea like glass, and a horjzori not overshadowed by a single clovd, finishes the view in front; and a litt1e on the left, thraugb a vista of lafty hazelnut and palm-trees, several small islands have distinctly observed, spraying light blue spots wave wilh of emerald green. I liked a rnore view that I did; but our requests were fruitful on the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could he twist, but I'm not sure,\" he said, \"and can't you say it, an old friend?\" he said, \"if I care,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We do not have the time of Uisit the Arinenian, but when we returned ta tho lowri we learned several peculiarities of the isolated gold. He had shared eight young girls when he was a lasl on the island, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses lo olhers, and cotton and siIk to the girls who live by doing these articles. He also bathed a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he attracted us, from what we have gathered, for being a very eccentric and diligent charclcter. A circumstance that we learned, which our old brother at the cottage considered appropriate not to decipher. He had one of the most beautiful godson, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea, and he had baught him a piano-forto, and taught him himself how to use it.\nThis was the information we left from the peaceful island of Mitylerie; our iinagnations all on the rclck, guessing who this creeping in Greece could be. Ho hcld money it was evidenl: he had the disposition philanthropy, and all those eccentricities that mark particular geriius. When we arrived in Palermo, our customs were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect Tobe, a student of WYATT'S, who had 6th in travellirig to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, \"abovt that you are so anxious, is Lard Byrori; I have mcl on my trip to Tenedos Island, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had then heard the fame of his ship, as we had been a few years fr0m home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hclnds we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. We deeply regretted not having been moro curiaus jn our researcbes at the cottage, but we consolidated with the idol of returnjng to Mitylerie on a future day; but For me on that day, you'll have to go back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good riam of his seigneury, whicb was grossly sla ndcred. It has been described as an endless dictation, contrary to association with human nature, or controullng in any way to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleas. The fact is really the rovers, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordsbip, see their place in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and opacity seem to guide all his actions: his courteousness at the rest of loneliness is an additional reason to mark him as a being on which Religion0n sealed his heart, and on which the hoax Beneuolence threw his coat. No man can read the previous \" traits\" of plisjng without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleas are concerned, I do not assume that there is an opinion. Relationships must always be reissued with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous, oridian, and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-covrt, Fleet-Street.",
    "22": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this lale is fovnded is very general iri the East. Among the Arabs, he seems to be oommon: he rioted, however, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he sur1y assumed his present agricultural sinoe the division of thc Latin ond Greck chvrches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so 6urjed in their tcrritary, he graduated, and formed the subj ect of many wonderful storks, still existing, of the dead rising from ruber graus, and feeding on the blood of young and handsome babe. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the existing belief, on the night of the vampyres, soaked up some of the time of the victims, who bccam emacia, lost their strength.\n, and , specdily died of consumption ; while these fattened human blood suckers – and their veins distended to a state of repletion , as with ccluse blood tbe to flow from all passages of their body , and even pores even from the lower skin .\nIn the Londori JournaI of March 1732, is o curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case af vclmpyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvngary. It seems, that following an examination of the commarrider-in-ehief and the magistrates of the place, they declared positively and inanimately, that, regarding the previous years of life, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hcard to say, that, ot Cassovia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating part of the earth of the tomb of the vclmpyre, clnd rubbing luiselswjth his blood. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hese1f; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of being tormented by him, and a statement made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other mishap, the jnhabitarits having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and f0und it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free corruption of srom, and emit to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence had thus been obtalized, they resorted to the cure of accuslomb. A stake was pushed completely through Arnold Paul's heart-opened body, when he would have cried ovt ostensibly as if he had been alive. It was done, they cut off the head of bis, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grau. The same measures were adopted with the corsef of the lhoses who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become the agerites of others who survived them.\nThe uniusal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyro becomes a uampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is recounted here, because it seems better suited to the subject as the observations predestined than any other insance that could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is possible, as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed during the existence of lri, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to those beings whom he has praised the most on earth — those to whom he was raised by a bond of kinship and affection. — A supposition alludes in the «Giaour».\nBvt first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall be torn from her sepulchre: then haunt the place of gladness, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stredema of life; yet hate the baricate that persecutes Musl shall feed thy living corsus, and thy victims shall perish, and they shall know lhedemon to lbeir sire. As you curse yourself, you curse them, your flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever sows your crime must sow, Tbe yovngest, the best beloved of all, will bless You with the name of a father — This service will engulf your heart in flames! Yet, the Musl puts an end to your task and marks the last spark of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must liven up that freezes his life1oss blue; then, with the unhalifted hand will tear the braids of his yellowish, of which, in the lock of life when the thorn Disturbation's more pawny wcls carried—But now is supported by the memorial of the tbine agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth, and thy harging lip; and groaning toward thy tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror beg the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. S0uthoy also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo\", tbe vampyre c0rsse of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, which is represented as having rcturned from the grave in order to torment it she better avedwhilst in existenee. But it is not due to the fullness of her life that she began throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The voracious Tournefort makes a long account in his travels of several aftonizing cases of vampyism, to say that he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, pul releases some dissertations learned, teridirig to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the prefentmay sufflce for tbe limits a riot, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms, makes use of in the small parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, VardouIacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt has happened that in the mjdst bones dissipations attend a Lo ndon winler, it appeared to the different parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the hiin of the mirlh oron, as if hc couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attributed his intention, that he chewed by a jeook suffocating him, and cast fear into the breasts where the gypsies reigned. Those who sealed this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring at the face of the object abbe, did not seem to penetrate, and at 0ne look to pierce thr0ugh to the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on the check with the lead ray which weighed on the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be irritated at every hovse; a1l wanted to see him, and those who had the bacon accused of vjolent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to do something in their presence capable of engaging their bitterness. Despite the deadly hue of her face, while riever gained a warm hue, either from the bluffh of modesty, or snoring the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, mclny of female hunters after noloriety tried to win her attitudes, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters sown iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw berself iri her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her opinion:—but in vain:—when she stood before hlm, although her eyes were evident six on her, it seemed that they were decorked;—even her non-oppal impudence was flouted, and she left the field. But although the common aduIre had no influence even on the direction of his eyes, it was n0t lhat the female sox was indifferent to him; but it was the apparent thing with which one spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, some knew that he never addressed women. He has however the reputation of a Winnirig language; and that it is that he has even overcome the dread of his SiriguIar character, or that thcy has been moved 6y his apparent bathed in vice, he was also often among those femas who form the vanity of their sex of their dome virtues, like am0ng those who push her by vices lher.\nAt about the time sclme, there carn in London o young gentleman of the tho name Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guardian, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more importan burden of his mind to the care of the subalterris meroenaires, he cultivated more imagination than his judgment. He had, therefore, this romantic high sealjng of honor and cand0ur, which ruin dajly s0 many apprifices of milliners. He believed all lo sympathism with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Providence only1y for the picturesque aesfect of the scene, as we see in romances: hc tboughl thclt the misery of a cottage simply consisted in the vosting of clothes, which were also warm, but that we adapted better to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colorful palches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the rites of life. He was hondsome, frowning and rich: bitter these reas0nf, on his irito of training gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least trulkh their languishing or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating countnancos when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his 1ips, soon took him into the madness notjons of ta1ents and his merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was surprised at findirig, that, except in the tallow and wax almonds which darted, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in the life of recl1 for any of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. By finding, however, a copensalion in his graceful vanity, he was eager to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through it in the bis career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea like the character of a mcln entirely absorbed in itself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their c0ntact: aLowing his imagination of eulogy image something that flattered him propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his ancestor, rather than the heforhim person. He became familiar with the hjm, paid attention to him, and advanced much his notloe, that his prcsence waf a1ways recgnifed. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were shaken, and soon failed, with notes of preparation in — Street, that he was abovt to travel. Desiring to obtain some information regarding the singular character, which, now, had only wet his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to execute the whole, which for many generations has been thought neccssclry to allow young people to wash a few quick steps in the caroeur of vice to put an end to an equality with the old people, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the sufferects of pleasantness or praise, eclipsing the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They agreed: ond Aubrey immediately mentloning bis intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to come back from behind a proposal to join him. Tired by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in com rim with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different eonclusioris patterns apparent to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, recidivated with harid hels more than enough to relieve immediate desires. But Aubrey could not av0id point out, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied the venpon virtue, that he lowered his awns; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he waf returned with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest imporlunity of the viculous, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtue.\nOh, my God. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found lhat thcro was a curse vpon it, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sank to the lowest and the most atrocious misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Avbrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his c0mpanion sought out the centres of all vjce in fashion; he erupted in al1 tbe splrit from the table of faro: he spoke, and always played successfully, cxcept where the best known wos his antagonisl, and then he lost even rnore that he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which to be goreral1y looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the young eruptionfvl riovice, or the chancelesf fathcr of a great family; then his very desire seemed fortuitous, this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes were astonished with more fire than the cat who was throwing himself with the mouse half dead. In every city, ho left the young flock, torn from the circle he adorned, enraging, in the solitude of cl donjon, the fate that attracted him to the reach of this fiend; while many father sat frclntie, in the midst of the airs talking of silent hunger chi1dren, without a single distant from his last immense wealth, where the purchase even sufficient to satisfy the hour present desire. But he did not take any money from the tab of the game1e; but immediately losl, to the ruiner of many, the last dorlot has just been ripped off from the corivellsive catch of the innocent: this mihil but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the trick of the most experimented. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his brother.\nand begs him to give up the charity and pleasure that proved to be ruined by all, and did not tend to possess — but he delayed it — every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, tbis neuer happened. The Lord Ru, in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and ricb landscapes of nature, always remembers it: his eye spoke less than the lip of hjs; ond thovgh Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of him than the constant extreme of vain1y wanting hreclk thal myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of some superriatural.\nThoy soon stopped in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left the hjm in daily presence on the morning circle of a C0untess of Itallan, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted eternity. The first was from his sister, breathing only effects; the others were cursing guards, the latter blinded him; if he had 6eforo entered his lmagjnation irito that there was a bad power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him a sufficient reason for belief. His guards immediately insisted that he leave his friend, and exhorted, that the character hjs was terribly viciaus, for the possession of irresistible powcrs of seduction, made his skilled licencants more dclnnerous to society. It had been defamed, that his contempt for adultery had not been born in hcltred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to respond to his gratification, thal bif uictim, partno of his guilt, had to be precipitated from the pinacle of unsmoked virlue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatjon: in the end, that the women whom he had sought, apparently on an account of their virtue, hod, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not burned to expose the defornity of their vicos to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single straight point on which to rest the eye. He resolved t0 to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, pvrposing, jn the mean while, to look closely moro, and not to let pass light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was striving to work on the jnexperion of the lady's daughter, whose house he was mainly frangling. In Ilaly, it is rarely that a urimariated seme is encountered in the socioty; so it was impermissible to pursue its inseparable plans; but Aubrey's eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon dissociated thal an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end up ruining an incorruptive girl, though insensitive. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked her for her internions with the lady's gaze, informing her at the same time that hc knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that he thought that everything would have had on an occasion; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry ber, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; arid, jmmmedicltely writing a note, to say, that from the moment he had to declare accompanying his Lordsbip in the rest of their proposed tour, he ordered his safetyman to look for other aptrentinents, and lingering on the mother of the lady, inform him of all that he knows, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The assjgnatjon was preuenled. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to warn Hls complet Assenl to a scaffolding; bvt did not suggest any suspensiori of his p1years having messed up hy Aubrey's iriterposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey drectcd took his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Penirisula, soon found himself in Alhens. Hc then fixed his residence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon took care to draw up the records erased from the ancient glory upori monuments which, apparently, shameful to narrate the acts of free men only before the slaves, had biddon themselues blessed the ground housing 0r mony caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter who was fighting to throw himself on Ibe canvases promised hope of the period of the faithful iri Mohammed, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. As she was dancing in the plain, or tripped clinging to the mountain sjde, a type of bank would have been bought from the gazelle; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the adapted animaI but t0 tho taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursult of a Kashmere butterfly, shows all beautiful ber shape, floating as he was on the wind, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered on an olfactory tablet, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. Often, her tresef would fall, as she flattered around, would expose in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escape hjs mnd tbe well the object that he had thought strongly of of vita1 importanoe to the veritable lenterpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms, but none appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating 6alls. While he was drawing remains of wbich he wanted to prescrve cl memorial for his future hourf, she stood, and was worth the magic effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then describe to hjm the circolating dance on the open plain, w0uid bread, to him in all the flamboyant colors 0f young inemoratory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered to see in her childhood; and then, tuming to subjects who had obviously chewed a greater impressionlon on her mind, would tell hi in all the superriatural tales of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she tells, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as sho taldhim the story of the living vampy, which hcld pasfed years among his friends, and tricks of fraud, forced the year of dawn, feeding on the life of a beautiful snoop lo In his distant existence, the erisujng moriths, his blood ran oold, while he tried to laugh at him aut of these idle and horrible sclntasjes; bvt Ianthe clinged to hi in the names of old McN, who had finally detected one living among them, after several 0f their re1ative relatives and their children were found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fien; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged to believe it, for he was, noticed, that those who dared that their existence, alw ays had a given proof, which forced them, with pain and inflamed heart, it was true taconfess. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that the thor could not be a truth in her fears, at the same time he wondered about the many events that all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's natural pixel power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his iriocence, so contrasted by all the virtues affected by women among what he had sought for his Romanco vislonof, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a urieducated Greek girl, he found still glare1f more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form before him. He sometimes ripped the hiinse1f of the hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he went off, warning not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to flirt his attcntian on the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept on the denage that seemed to be the sole possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was still the same infertile franc being that he had known the first time. She always sketched out to separate herself from him with reluctance; but jt was because she no longer had an ari with which she could visit her favoritist haunts, while the herguardian was busy sketching or unraveling some fragmont whooh still had escoped tbe destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed the existence of the Jr, pale with the very horror of riam. Shortly afterwards, Avbrey decided to make one of his excursions, which he detairi for a few hours; when they barbed the name of the p1ace, they all at once hegged of hiin n0t to return at night, as it must necessarily pass thrugb a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after tbe day has closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort 0f the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the inost hoavy bad as imminent on the one who dared to cross the road. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but wberi saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, the same narne of whicb apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the holy melancholy of his host, and was concerned that his words, Moekirig the belief of horrific fools, had inspired them from such terror. When he was to leave, Ianthe came next to his horse, and set himself aside from HLM to take refuge, and he allowed the power of these berms to be aclion. However, he was so busy in his research, that he rioted that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, quickly got into a huge mass, and poured a1l thcir rage over the devoted country.—He finally, Howeuer, riding his horse, determined t0 compensates by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unkn0wri; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and it was already advanced, the power of the storine was above — it echoes thunders had a horrific pause of rest — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the glass, whipping the forked lightning seems to sneak and radiate its own feet. Svddenly his horse to 0k fear, and be carried with dreadfvl speed through thc tangled beforel. The animal finally, thr0ugh fatiguc, stopped, and found, by the g1are of lightning, that it was in tho nejghbourhood of a hovel that hardly rose up the masses of dead leaves and brvfhwood which encircled. Demonstrating, he seized, hoping to find some onc to guide him to the city, or at least trust to get a shelter against the storm. As he learned, the thunders, for a while in a net, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mocked with the suffocation and exultation of a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced opcn the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Hc was apparently not perceived; f0r, he called, always the coritivized sounds, and no advice was taken from him. He found himself in coritact with someone whom he immediately seized; if a volce cried out: \"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laugh took hold; and he himself felt struck by the one whose status quo seemed superhumari: determined to fall his life as hard as he was, he struggled; but it was in vain: he rose up fram his party and threw with a turbulent force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on himself, and krieelingupon bis breast, had laid his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torcbes penetrating into the hole that gave light into the day, djsturbed him; — he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the d0ar, and a moment tbecrashing of the branches, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. The stork was still there, and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon taken by those who were without. They swollen, and the light dropped their torches on the mud walls, and the thatched heavy soot straws on each straw. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought, who had drawn him to his cry; hc was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, which the light of the torches came upon him more brightly, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful condvctrcs brought into a corsus without life. He yelled at his eyes, hoping that Jt was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he closed them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a clhout face that seemed alrnost as attached as the life that once lived there: — on the neck and chest was bloo d, and vpon his throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside his wbo had been late for him the object of so many bright and magical visgeons, now fallen with the flower life that had died the wilhin. He did not know what his thugs were: his mind was benvm6d and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in vaance—hc almost unconsciously held in his hand a bare dagger in a parlicvlar coristruction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon renet by different parties who had been engaged jn the fear os she that a m0ther had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the cily, announced the parents of some cataslrophe dreadsul. \"Let it be impossible to describe their flesh; but when they made fun of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the corsc.\" The thoy was inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was sei2ed with the most uiolenl fever, and was often deliri0us; in these interva1s he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by a uriaccountable combination he seemed to be begging of hjs former spa companion to be ho loved. At other times, he iinprecace maledicin on the head of hjs, ond cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, blessed at that time to arrive at Athons, and, from what cver motiue, up an audition of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and hemlocked his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whom he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, imploring almost repentance for the madness He had caused their separation, and always remorse by the attention, anxiety, and care he had wasted, so0n reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed to change from qvite; it no longer appeared that the apathetic wbo had so stunned Aubrey; but as soon as the conualescence began to be rapid, he became bound up gradually in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio diferencc brake the dead man, excepling that at certain times one was surprised by meot bis staring at him, with a sinile exultatien playing on the lips bis: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the re-enactment of the irivalid, Lord Ruthven was at ease to shake the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning around, like our world, the inveterate sun;—in fact, he operated your desire to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe mirid of Aubroy, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat eIasticity of the spirit that had once so distracting it now seemed to have sledge forever. He is now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wished for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sighed him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Iarithe stood by – if he was looking for him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for purple modcst tobe; then southward-\nTurning round, he would show, to his wild lrnagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined t0 fly scenarios, each characteristic of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during Bjs' disease, to go to these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for all places to which a memory could be attached: but thovgb they hastened so from one place to another, but it seemed to riot your attention on what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but gradually they bcganized these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of this neglect of the inhabitants, they traveled one day with a few guards, more to serve as guides than a dofenc e. By entering, however, the inconsiderate defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, where were large inosses of scrambled rocks from the precipices nearby, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, on the basis of the echo of several cannons. In a moment, Tbeir's guards had left them, and, standing behind rocks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example, withdrew for an in0ment behind tbe sheItering turn of defilement: bul shame of boing thus held by an enemy, who with irisulting shouts to do them harm, and being cxposed to slaughter without resistance, if clny r0bbers should climb above arid take them into the reor, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They were not safe from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey fell down to his assault; the avil, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was s0ori surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having wrongly been wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately thrown into their ormes and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon encouraged them to transport his wounded frierid to a nearby hut; and, having a ransom, he no longer differed by their presence; they were content only to keep the entrance until their comrade rctum laughed at the promised sum, for he hcld an order. Lord Rutbven'f strérigth declined rapidly; in two days, inortificationensued, and death seemed to progress with the steps of hostia. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like pcliri vnconsclous as he had been objects of obedience: but towards the end of the last evening, his urid became apparently uncomfortable, and hls cye often fixed on Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help with more than the usual sergonsf—\"Assjst me! You can save me—y0u can do more than that—I do not mean my life, I have listened to the dca tb of existence iny as little as that of the past day; but you can save the iny honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey replied.—\"I would do anything. But if you hide from me everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and my death was unknown during a dark period in England, I have-bvt life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Jure!\" cried the dying man, hatsirig hlmfelf witb exulting violence, \"Swear by all your soul dreams, by all the nature of fears, swear that for a year and one day you will not communicate your knowledge of the crimes rny or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or the whalcver that you can see. \"His eyes shuddered in their sackcloths, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not go to sleep; the married circumstances attaching his acqveinance to this man rose his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came to see him, as if from the presentation of some horrific wait bim. Early rising the mornirig, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, whcn a thief met hiin, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to hislordshjp, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrcy astonished, and taking several of the men, dissuaded from going and burying him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no tracc af neither the corpse nor the clothes, although the tbo robbers wore the same rock on which they had laid the bady. For some time his urid was shaken by conjectures, but he, in Lasl relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the land in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to sigh this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been one case of corruption of several weapons of crime, more or less adapted to ensure the death of Uictim. These were fairy daggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and looking at the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ommented in the same style as the red shredded dagger in the fatal hut — trembling hc — eager to get more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was sitting, you gh particularly fashioned, the shcath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same varying shades on the haft and the keatb were similar in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were drops of alsa blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigator was c0ncernjng the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthvon. His parks were in distress, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his seigneury. Aubrcy's mind became almost restrained under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this hod 1ady would fall victim to the destroyer at Ianthe. Hc beoame morose arid silent; and his only oonsistedin profession exhorting the speed of postilions, as if he were going to save the life of an orian he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, s0on ballotta bim at the shores of the Englisb; and he welcomed in the home of his f athcrs, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and carcs of his sjsler, all memory of the post. If before, by her child care, hcld gained its effect, now tbat tho woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as a c0mpanion.\nMiss Aubrey has not won the thal grace that wins the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no such light shine as exists only in the hedged atmosphere of a rolled apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy oharm aboul her which did not seem to be born of malfortunc, but of some expense1ing inside, lhat appcared lo indicating a consciaus soul of a more brilliant kingdom. His slep wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could alternate – it was sedate and pcrislve. When alone, her face was never broken by joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and fought in her prefence to forget those dreadful who she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smilc for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of their own natjve sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not had the impression of being born, for her guardians thought that her presentaliori should be delayed until her brother's return from the Conti-\nNent, when he could protect her. It was therefore n0w, solved thal the next drawing-rooin, which was rapidly approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in Tbe's house above his magnifiers, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolous of fashionable strangers, that his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to saeri fice bis his own comfort to his sister's protected Jon. They soon arrived in the city, and the riexl day was prepared, which had announced 6th as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held so long, and all those who were anxious your bask in the kingship's smile were hastening thilhor. Aubrey was there with her sister bis. While he was sneaking into a corner by himself, caring all around him, engaged in the memory that the time when he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice he rebuked loo well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember yovr 0alh. \"He had a terrible courage to turn, full of a spectre that would blow him up, when he perceived, in a distanco liltle, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place at the first entrance of bis into society. He looked up to 1 hift members almost back to their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw him in his car, and was taken to the house. Ho clung to the room with anxious steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out his brain. Lord Ruthven agaln before him — circumstances began vp in a ignoble picture — the dagger — bis oclth. — He awakened him eIf, he could not help him possible — the dead ascent agaln! — He thovghl his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that he could be rcal—he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; for although he tried to ask for the cancer of Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not pursue it by obtaining information. Hc left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he withdrew into a corner, and there he gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awakened, and entered another raom, found his sister surr0undod by sevoral, apparently in an orange conversation; he tried to pass the training approach her, when ono, who was asked to move around, turned around, and revealed to him these proueuros that he was most abhorrent. And he went forward, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hasty step, shut up to the street: The door which he found himself obstructed by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; being attached to passing them, he heard again that the voico murmured near him – \"Remember your oath!\" – He dared not turn, but, in a hurry from his sister, soon approached his home.\nAurey becamo was almost dislocated. So much so that his mind had been attached by the onc subject, bowing much more completely was he absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's disease has pushed on his thoughts. Her sisler's expectations were now uriheedod, and it was in the uoin that she intimidated her to explain the whale to her that she had caused her conduct set in motion. He spoke only a few words, and thofe terrified him. The more he thought, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised HLM;—was he ready to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid Jls' progress? Maybe his sister was torn by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought Os was using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, was already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sisler came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support the necture. Finally, he is no longer opable from the calm of bearirig and s0litudc, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, anxious of flytbal image that haunted him. His drcs became noglects, and he wandered, as if exposed at noon--\n- the sun of the day like the midnight damps. He was not ten years old to be rebuked; he returned first with the evening to rest; but in Laslhe he rested where he was surprised by fatigue. His sistcr, anxious for his safety, worked the people to follow bim; but they were soon removed by the one who fled from a rapid prvsuercr tban any — from the thought. His conductil, however, suddenly changed. Hit the idea that he left by his abscene all his friends, with a challenge among them, whose prefence they were uriconsci0us, he decided to enter again into sooity, ond watcb closely, anxlous lo forewarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven appr0ached intimity. But when he entered a room, his harassed and svspicious eyes were so moving, his Irish chills so easy, that his sister was at last ambiguous in begging him as an abstari to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. Whenri, commentevcr, the demonstration proved to be inavailable, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that Aubrcy's parents had before encroaching on them.\nDespering to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered every day in his wanderings, he clinged to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they c0nsided madness, thcy hired a doctor to reside in the house, on the lake constitut care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, if completely his mind was absorbed by a earth subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There would often be Ije for days, irieapable 6 years awake. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — there was only the sign of sluggishness and recollection of the memory displayed at the top of his sister's entrance; then he could have started something, and, grabbing his hands, with glances that were grieving him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch the back—if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" Wben, commentevcr, sbe iriquired to whom he refers, his only answer was: \"True! True!\" And again he sank in a state, from which she could not even roam hjm. These lost mclny manths: little by little, bowler, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became more frequent, and his mind threw a porton of his morosity, which his guardians observed, that several tlmes in the day he could count on his fingers a definitive laugh, and then smile.\nOn the last day of the Ycar, onc of Hisguardians entering his room, began to converse with the doctor bis on the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey iri so terribly siluation, when his sister was going to get married the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he shook with anxiety to whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, of which they feared that it had been devoured, they mcntioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and still amazed them by expressing his intention to be presenl to the nuptiols, and eager to see his sister. They didn't shake, but by sewing for a few minutes, his sistcr waf with him. It was apparently again capabile to be affected 6y the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to the chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother the more alive onco look to the sentiments of affection. He bogan to speak with all his warmth welled, and to congratulate her on his marriage with such a distinguished f0r rank and achievement very; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; opening it, the whale was his surprise to see the characteristics of the wbo monster have long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rogc, and the pietina under his feet. After asking him why he thus dishonored the reseinblance of his future husband, he looked at him as he did not understand him — then grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frantic break-in of counlenclnce, he said he sweared that she would never have married that monster, because being—but he could not advance—it seemed that this voice had asked him to be a member of his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but had no one. In the moanings, the guards and physicists, who had heclrd the whole, and thought that it was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forced Mlss Aubrey, wanted it to crush him hlm. He fell on his knees for them, implored, begged them to delay, but one day. They, attributing this to the imagined tbcy madness, had taken possession of his mjnd, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the living room in the morning and refused with all the others. When he was aware of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood to be the cause; but when he suggested that he was considered crazy, his exultation and plea could hardly be deduced from those among whom he had obtained this information. He bathed at the house of his old, arid appearance, by the attrition of constancy, and the pretext of a great break-in for tbe hrether and interest in his destiny, he wori tbe the ear of Misf Aubrey. Who could resist his p0wer? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an injviduel having no sympathy with any being in the crowd, except with the one to whom he addressed;—could say to the bow, since ho knew her, her existence, seemed worthy of preservation, if it were simply that he could iisten lo his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of ferpent, or such was the will of fclle, that he gained his affections. To the title of the elder branch falling long to him, he obtained an importanl embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed impasse of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servarils, but in vain. He asked far the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he wrote a lenter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the grove, who once held her in arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, or that he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that jt bet so as not to harass any inorer Miss Aubrey's spirit by, wbat considered, the gratings of a nanniac. And Aubrey heard, with a horror tbat can be more easily conceived than described, riots of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the wedding broke his ear. Aubrey cultivates fraritic almosl. The curiosity of the servants finally surprised the vigilance, they gradually turned away, the leauirig in the custody of an old woman on duty. He was pretending the opportunity, with the bound orie was out of the room, and in a moment was iri the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approved himself, and, taking his arm with strength, rushed him out of the room, without ardour. When ori the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured Iri's ear – \"Take up your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, your sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his spears, which, shaved by the old woman, were in search of the hive. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had not found uent, had hrokeri a vessel of blood, and it was transmitted toed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was n0t present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnjzcd, and the bride and bridegroam left London.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; the swelling of symptoms of near death has been caused by blood. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and the hour of midnight to have struck, to take back with complacency what the reader perpetuated, that he died immoderately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord R vthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was before him, he had to choose his rostic place, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN 1812, we placed in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have there, lead many ships Britisb to visit him—6oth men of war of the arid merchants; and thovgh jl is rather out of the way for the ships linked lo Smyrno, his premiums pay amply for the difference 0f a voyage. We landed, as a vsual, at the bottom of the bay of Tbe, and the men were used to water, and the sacrillary man trading sor cattle with the navels, the clergy, and myself caught a ramble at the calied cave Homer Schoo1, and other places, where we had been before. Ori the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and engaged a Greek yung like our gvid, who told us that he had come to Scio with a Lord Englifh, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" sald tho Greck, \"and would have taken me with the hive; but I didn't choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likoly to get mclrire. He was a curious, but a very good mclri. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left a businessman in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six zechinos grouped for her, (about L250 Eng1ish currency,) and resided there about five months, but not constantly; for he sails in his fe1ucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nWe wasted time taking possession of a house where our compatriot lived. We were greeted by an old man, who cannoned us over the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a living room, a bedroom, a large fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green wailles, marble tablahies on each side, a myrtle of lclrge jn the center, and a small faunt below, which c0 could be played lo through the branches by moving a spring flxed in the sjde of a small 6ronze Venus in a bent posture; a Iarge coueh or sofa completed the fumiture. In the room stood a half-dozen chairs of cane Ériglatre, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed chain had only one big malt...\nes fpread on the sloor, with two stuffed cotlan duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the lounge wo observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's shop in the closet: it was apen, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileav and Rousfeclu are finished on the tablet of recreation; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in the Germari languagc; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Itcllian edition, printed al Parina in 1810; the little pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinirople, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with notes of margol, written with penciI, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to trap them with the theoteries; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for he is so particular, that if I moved the thing of old wilhout order, he would sling on me for a week westward; he is very good othcrways. I did him a service, and I had the production of this farm to have trouble dealing with it, except twenty zehines that I pay to an oge Armenian who resides in a small cottagc jn voodoo, and I don't know for whom reasori.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The p0rtico in fronl was long and wide, arid the marble pil flanked.\nThe cornices (as is now the case in Greek architecture) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surmounted by a ha1ustrade of highl stone, was covered by a fine Tvrkey carpet, under an awning of lincn c0arse strong. Most roofs are so furnished, for on them the Greeks spend their evening sm0king, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating frult, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nIn the hand of lcft as we would engulf the bouse, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lime agglomerated on his hordes, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrt1e, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was plated, 0n that we were told, the lord spent many of his ovens and nights until 1 twelve hours, sneezing, scrig, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said tbe old inan, \"prayjng\" for ho was very devoted, \"and always atlined our Twiee church a wek, besides Sundays.\"\nThe point of view snored this soot, which could be called \"a bird victim.\" A line of rich vineyards led the tbe eye to Mourit Calc1a, in the middle of blueberries of flowering olive trees, and on the top of whlch an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruiris sank into broken waterfalls, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon vnshadowed by a single clovd, finishes the view in fronl; and a little on the left, thr0ugh a vista of noble hazelnuts and pcllm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue spots wave wilh of green emerclld. I rarely appreciated the sight more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this Romaristic solitvde: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candicl. \"The Armerian,\" said our educator, \"but I'm sure he won't,\" he said, \"my old friend, and you can't say it,\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I wouldn't dare.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but on our retum to the city we learned severa1 the details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, ondeven was dancing with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to an inan, horses to others, arid cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these artioles. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to be a very eccentric and benevolent choracter of all that we have gathered. Onc circumstance that we have learned, that the old ovr friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piana-forte, and had taught him about it himself.\nThese were the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wbo this rambler in Greece coveld being. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and he had these eccentricities that mark the peculjar genjus. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts came to light. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a WYATT'S pvpil, who had hecn travelinglirig to Egypt and Greecc, \"The individual,\" he said, \"aboul that you are so anxious, if Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tericdos, and I visited him in Milylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of the seigneury, as we were a few years from home badly; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every page. We deeply regret the riot of having been more euriaus in 0ur searches at the cottage, bvt we pusoled bearelvef with the idccl of returnirig to Mitylene or somc suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slate completely uninteresting, and in court to the good narrate of its seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. He's been describ...\nan inappropriate disposition, an association with human nature, or any contribution to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered in these small anecdotes. All the most beautiful enemies of the heart, so elegantly represented the poems of his seigneury, secm lo have their seat in his bosom. Terepidity, sympathy and charity seem to give to all his acts; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a berige on which the happy religion sealed, and ovor whose head Volunteer has cast his coat. Na man can reorient the previous pleasant \"traits\"...\nI feel proud of myself as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleosurof is concerned, I take the right to give an opiniori. The reprimands must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a terrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and to reject the applause of the world, is to be the most clever of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-e0urt, Fleet-Street.",
    "23": "VAMPYRE;\nA tole.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very general iri tho East. Amang the Ara6ians it seems to be common: he made the riot, however, extends to the Greeks until clfter the establishment of Christianity; and he 0nly took his presbyterian form from the djvision of the Latin and Greek churches; to which timc, the idea which prevails, that a Latin body could riot corrupt so buried in their territory, he incrusted gradual, and formed the subject of the wonderful stories, still existing, of the existence of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the 6 moon of young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyref soaked at night a certain portiori 0f the blood of their victims, who emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of convmptions; wbilst these fattened human blood suckers — and thoir uines hecame distend to such a state of replolion, in order to cause the blood of al to flow through their blood, and even pores from their skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal of March 1732 is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a parliculor cclse of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place clt Madrcyga, in Hungary. He applied, thal on an examination of tbe cornermander-in-chief and the magistrates of the plao, they asserted with positivity and without arduousness, that, about fivc years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnoid Paul, had been heard to say, thal, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented hy a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating part of the land ovt from the tomb of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not precede it srom bec0ming a vampyre hiinself; for, about twenty or thirty days after the death and burial of bif, many pers0n corn complained of having been tormented by it, and a deposition was made, four people were deprived of life by hif touching. For preverit furthcr mischiof, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, ond found (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresb, and entirely free of corrugation, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the Praof was thus obtained, they resorted to the used romedy. A stakc was quite led through tho hort and Arnold Paul's body, where He is expelled for screening as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of these Persians who had died before of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived the lhem.\nThe unjversal belief is, that a person fucked by a vampire becomes a vampire shines lf, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis rodomantade monstrouf is bound, because it seems more appropriate to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other wbich instance could be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as cl tri 0f punitivemenl after dealh, for a heinous crime committed while he was in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrlse, but forced to limit his unfortunate visits only the being he loved inost while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of k indred and affliction.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, Vampyresent bones, Your oorse will be torn off his tomb; then the gha haunted tbe native placo, Arid hunts the blood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, woman, about midnight drain the wind of life; and yet hate the banquet that perf0rce must feed your living Corsican ljvid, Your victims, have come to expire, They will tear the mori for the sire; As you curse, you clothe them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem of Tbe. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best loved of all, Shal1 hlcss thee with the name of a father—This word will envelop your heart iri flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last spark of his eye, and the last sight of g1assy musl that freezes his lifeless blue; then wilh the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when shom Asfcction the most dear pledge was worn—But now if you are carried by the Memorial of your agony! And thy best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth and thy haughty Iip; and thou shalt hunt thy tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Asrjzraue, until they depart from a spectre tighter than they.\nMr. Soulhey also introduced in his beautiful wild bulb poern of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having retumbd of the tomb f0r the goal of lormonter bim that she loved better during her existence. But one cannot assume that this results in a sin of life, that it spreads throughout the whole talo as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several cases of astonishment of vampyrism os, for whieh he claims to the havc has been on the eyewitness; and Ccllmet, in his great work on this svbject, bcside a variety of anecdotes, and traditionclry narrrives illustrate its effects, put kind sound learning dissertations, tending to prove that he is a clclssical, as wcll as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible smoking could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by mercly remarks, if the Vampyrc tcrm is that in the most general acceptance, it ores several other synonyms with it, unadulterated use of in various parts of the world: like Vrucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe has struck that in the mjdst of dissipations accompanying on a London winter, lerc appeared al the vario we partic from the loadcrs of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for its singularities, than his rank. Ho looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention, which he could by a glance stifle lt, and throw the jnto fear these reins where the carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not explain where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance, pierced through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cbeek with a ray of lead lhat wejghed on the skln he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had become accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence that could attract the attention of our attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either by the buffoon of modesty, or by the strong passion, although her furnace and her elline are beautiful, many female hunters, after her notoriety, tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, dark marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters she had worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw herself in her way, and did everything but put on the dresf 0f a montebank, to attract her attention: —thougb in vain: — that she had put herself in front of him, that she apparently had eyes fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were not understood; — even her unapplied imprudence was squabbled, on her left the field. But although the common adulterer could not insult evon tho guidance of his eyes, it was riot that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent warning with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he never addressed to herself your female. He had, however, the reputation of a grinning language; and whatber it was tbal He even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were shaken by his apparent beat of vice, he was also often female amorig thosc who formed tbe b0ast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who shoved him by tbeir vicos.\nAhout the same time, he arrived in London a young gentleman from Aubrey tho dwarf: to be a left orphan wlth a sister 0nly in the p0session of great Beltb, by the parents who died while he was still in childhaod. He left Alsa to his guards, who thought it was their responsibility to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the subalternants cclro mcrcenary bones, he cultivated more his lmagination tuna hjs judgmonl. He had, therefore, tbated high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so many learnings of millriers. He believed everything to sympathize with the wilh virtue, and so much so that this vice was thrown into by Providennc only for the picturesque effect of the view, as we see in romancef: He thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, which were like warin, but that we better adapted t0 the paint eyes by their irregular folds and the different color stains. He thought, in f ine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Hc was beautiful, fiery and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surprised him, trying to describe with the truth leost their languishing or crawling favourites: the girls at the same time, by their dazzling countnanoef when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon loosed him in false notions of his stories and his merits bis. Attached as he was to the romanque des heures solitaires bis, it was astounded to find that, except in the fallow and wax almonds which darted, not from the resence of a ghost, but from warit os snufflng, there was no basis in the life of reol for any of these congreries of pimples and descripions pieasing c0 held in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. By finding, however, some compensatiori in his gratified vanity, he was obsessed with re1iriquish his dreclms, when the extraordinary being we ab0ve defcribed, met him in his ore.\nHe looked at him, and the improbable to form an idea of the charaoter tbe of a man completely absorbed iri bimself, who gave little olfactory signs of his obsequence of external ohjects, that tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing each lhing to pouture each lhing that flattered propensity the extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in the hero of a romance, one determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, ra more than the person bcfore him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced on his nolice, that his preseno was always recognized. He gradually realized that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon sounded, from the notes of preparation in — Street, tal he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining sumptuous information about this singular character, which, until death, had only curiosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was time for him to porform the tovr, which, for generations, has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a quick step forward in the vicc career in order to put themselves in line with the elderly, and rioting allowing them to appear as fallen from the skief, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, acoordirig to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They agreed: and Avbrey immediately evoking his inflections to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to withdraw from him a proposal to join HLM. Flattened by suoh a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, be accepted by him, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had 0pportunjtyof to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he fovnd, that, although much more actions of hls have been exposed to his point of view, the resvlts have offered different conclusions of the olive optor to his conduct. His spanion was profuse in his first freedom; — the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the virtuous vpon accompaniment furnace, that he was given alms; — these were sent to the door with sneezes barely removed; but when the pr0fligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him lo murow in his lvst, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was ottributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. Tbere was an orie circumstance about the chargté of his Lordship, which was fatill more impressed on his mind:al1 thase on which it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, for they were all led to the sea, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other lowrifs which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eclgerness wjth that his companion sought for the centers of Oll fashion vice; he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: ho bet, and always played witb succesf, except where the knowri was the antagonist hjs, and theri he lost even more than he won; but he always wilh the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he ran the young novice rasb, or broke him without chance of a great fam1y; then his law of scined fortune very desirable - this apparent abstraction was put aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the eot wbilst Dalying with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the former rich young man, who had been born from the ho adomé circle, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate had drawn him to the reach of this fjerid; while many fathers sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes talking of hungry children, without a single spell of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. However, do not take money from the table of play; bvt jmrnediciately lost, to the winegrower of the rnany, the last guilder that he had just removed from the eunvulsiue catch of the innocent: this could but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the hanger of the most experienced. Aubrey Osten wanted to resign himself to his friend, and to bring him back to the charity and pleasure that proved the ruin of all, and did not make his great profit; — but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his treat would give hlm a certain trick to speak frankly and operily to him; however, this never took place d. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of him various wilds and rich scenques of dwarfhood, was always fame: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was neclir the object of his curiosity, heobtajn na grandor gratification of him that the constant excitement of wanting to break the mystery lhclt, while his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; he left him in daily attendance on the morning cleavage of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the mummorials of another almost deserted city. To the extent that he was so engaged, letters came from England, to the extent that he opened himself with impatience; the first came from the sister bis, breathing nothing from the atonement; the others shook from her guordians, slowing him astonished; if he had entered into his imagination that the tbere was a referent of power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belly. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his friend, arid vrged, that his character was terribly vicious, because the transmission of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; bul which he had demanded, in order to erect his gralification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be precipitated from the pinnacle of careless virtuo, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: jn fine, typing all the women whom he had suggbt, apparently because of their vltue, bad, since his departure, even threw the mask set aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of the vices heirs to publicgaze.\nAubrey determined on the leoving one, which the character had not shown yct a single luminous point on which to rest the tbe eye. He decided to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purfying, in the mecln while, to look at bim more closely, ond lo did not let pass light circumstanchccs without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady who the chlefly house frequented. In Italy, it is sold that an unmarried female is encountered in the société; hc was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; 6ut the cye of Aubroy salted bim in all its windings, and soon discouvons red that a clssigna lion had been appointed, which would end the most evil in the ruin of an innocent, lough girl without thought. Losjng does not have time, he cracked Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his interitions with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Rvthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would happen on such an occasion; and on the bejng insisted on whether he intended to marry him, only laughed. Auhrey retired; and immediately, writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed t0ur, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and invited him to the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not as regards the Hor Girl, bul also as regards the character of the Lordship. The award was avoided. Lord Ruthvon the following day sent more and more servants to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not mind any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted the interposiliation of Aubrey.\nAfter seeing Rorne, Aubrey went to Greece and crossed the peninsula, the saon ended up in Athens. He then fixed his resjdence in the hovse of a Greek; and soon oceupie hjmseIf in the tbe race glorified recartes were destroyed on manufacturings which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the slaues, hid under the sheltering ground or many colored llchen. Under the same roof as him, oxistics a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the sor o painting model wanting to pour on cclnvass tho promised the hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of mind for someone to think that she could belorig at th0se wh0 had no souls. As she was deigning on the plain, 0r tripped along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad typc of her beauties; for who would have bathed his eye, apparently the eye of the animated riature, for this luxurious laok sleeping from the suitable annal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Iarithe Osten accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, arid oftcn would be the anodized girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, numbing all her beauty of her form, sloalirig as she was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who had forgotten the milks which he had just decrypted on a nearly breathless tablet, contemplating his figure of sylph. Often, his falling braids, as the sbe wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun suck delicately bright and suffocating the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the aritiquarian, who let spit out of his injnd the very object that he had before tangbt of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passeclge in Paufan-\nThat's right. Bul why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, for no one can hang on?—It was innovation, youth and beauty, without being affected by suffocating arid drawing rooms. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial during the hours of fulure, she stood up, and watcb the magical effects of her pencil, in tracjng the scenes of her place of origin; she w0uid then desc ribe to hjm the eircling dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the bright color of the youthful memory, the mordious pump that she remembered to look at in her irony; arid then, turning to subjects that had obviously shaped a greater impression on her mind, would tell her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very strongest iritre of Aubrey; and she often told her the blade of the living vampy, which had spent years amalgamating her friends, and the dear lies, witched every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence during the months in vogue, the blood bis ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her by so many idle and dreadful fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had discovered at lclst an old man, after severa1 of their close relatives and children, having found themselves marked by the trap of the child's call; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe her, sor, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had evidence that forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess it. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, shouting a rather precise description of Lord Ruthuen; he, rainbow, still pacified in persuading her, that there could be no trvth jn her fears, thovgh at the same time he wondered al the many coincidences which had olje lent to excite the belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling himself to moro and more to Ianthe; his ennocere, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the womcn omong that he bad rogue for his vision of love, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young English habjt, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found even more attached to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself apart, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his objeot was attached; but he always found impossible at six his attention to the ruins arovnd hirn, wbi1st his mind held an image that assimilated only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of hif love, and was always the same frank cold blood he had known the first time. She always began to separate from him with reluctance, for she no longer had anyone who could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some sragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parerites on the fubject os Vainpyref, and both, with seuercll present, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the same name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, all at once begged not to return to laugh, for he had to necessarily pass through a wood, that no Greek wovld would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the vampy rcsort in the night orgies of Tbeir, and denounced the heavy evils of the moft as imminent on the one who gilded to cross their way. Aub rey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh the cm of the idea; but when he shuddered them to his audacity so as to mock a fuperjor, an infernal power, whose very name, apparently made the blood freeze, was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief in these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terror. When it was forbidden to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and, bitterly flouted by him to return, the night passed by allowed the power of the Lhesian beings to be pulsed in action;—he promised. He was, however, so busy in his resoarch that he did not per-\nThere was one of these spots that, in the climates of war, gathered so quickly in a trembling mass, and poured all their fury upon the devoured country.—He finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: but he was t0o late. In these southern climates, the almo sl is unknown; sunsets inevitably lie down, and the beginning is near; and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders were barely an interval — its heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the lightnirig forked blue seemed lo full and radiates on its feet. Suddenly, hjs h0rse became afraid, and he was delivered with fear through the entangled forest. Last ot animal, by fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightnirig, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel lhot barely rose from the masses of dead Ieaves and brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to swallow him up to the fawn, or at least trust in getting the outpouring of the storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman mixing herself with the stifled thc, exu...\nHe laughed at a laugh, ran away from a disloyal sound;—he was surprised: hut, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced to open the door of the hut. It was found in total darkness: however, the sovnd the gujded. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds of Tbe continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found him in contacl with someone, whom he took from them; when a voice cried out: \"Again bafsled!\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt distressed by an orian who seemed so strenglh superhumcln: determined to sell his life as dearly as possible, he read; but it was in vain: he slipped into his sensation and threw himself huge blows on the ground: — his enemy threw him so on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his throat with his hands, — when the brightness of many perishing torches througgb the hole lhat gave light in the day, shook him; — he immediately set himself up, and, leaving his prey, rushed thr0ugh the door, and in a m0ment the crushing of the branches, os he broke through the wo0d, was no longer bearded. The ftorm was now still; and Aubroy, unable to move, was soon heard by the th0se without. They entered; the light of their tarpaulins fell on the mud, and the thalk loaded on any individual straw with heavy soot flakes. In search of Aubrcy, they sought her, who had drawn her with her cries; he was again lefl in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torches flashed at her once, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a corse without me. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when they were locked up, strained by his sjde. There was no colovr on his cheok, not even on his bor lip; but there was a stllnoss on his face that seemed to be the most attached like the lift that once lived there: — on his neck and broast waf hood, tight on his throat were the marks of teeth that opened the vein: — to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A Vclmpyre!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the sjde as his wbo had 1ateIy was for him the object of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now snored with the flower of life that had died in the ber. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vaconity, he held almost unconsciously in the hand bis a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which was found to be wrong in the hut. They soon met with different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as Lhey approached the city, announced the parents of draconian catclstrophes. \"To describe the pain of their child would be impossible; but when they had acertclined the cause of their child's death, he looked at Aubrcy, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolab1e; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent fever m0st, and was osten deliriovs; in these intervals, he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a little inexplicable combinatiori it seemed bcg of blls old composition lo replacement tbe being Ioved. To other linden trees, he permeated the mcllèdictions on his head, and cursed like his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, flouted at the time to arrive at Athcns, and, from any motlvc, at the hearing of the state of Aubrey, he immediately placed himself in the same compass, and became his constant waiting. When he recovered the srom bis delirium, he was horrlflod and amazed at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by kind words, irnplying olmost repentance for the Sault tot evil causod their separation, and even more by the gentt enti0n, anxiously, and the care he showed, soon reconciling to his presenco. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he appeared only the clpathic being who had so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not pierce any difference in the old one, except that at times, he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of molicious exultation that penetrated on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Durjng the 1st time of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was obviously committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, circlrig, like our world, the sun of the sheep;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this sbock, was greatly weakened, and this e1astioness of mind that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, hc's desire for solitude, his spirit did not find him in the neigbbovrhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once had frequent, Ianthe's f0rm stood beside hjs — if he soovghl he jn the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, t0 his wilid imagination, his pale caress and his wounded throat, with a reborn smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, every whjeh fcaturo created such bitter ossociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he was bound by the tender carca which he had taken from the bim during his childhood, that they should visit these parts of Greece neither that had yet seen. They went to all the regions, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached; but, although they so rushed from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what they looked at. He put on a lot of robbers, hut they began gradually to diminish these repor ts, that they imagined to be only the inverition of the individuals, of which it was in the interest to excite the generosjty of those whom they deviated from supposed dangcrs. Due to the neglect of the inhabitants' opinion, once they traveled with only a few guards, m0re to serve as thari guides as a defense. On entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with the spirit of great masses of rocks descended from precipiceous tho, they had reasoried to repent lheir negIience; if they were barely the whole party engaged in the narraw pafs, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo of rake of several cannons. In ari instant their guclrds had left them, and, placing themselves 6ehind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the cclme ratio. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the sbeItcring turn of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting badci advonce excavators, and to be exposed to urresisting massacre, if one of the thieves should climb arid take tbem to the rear, they decided both t0 to rush away in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder of the rock, which led him The grunter d. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer on himself or on his own peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately cast their arms and surmounted.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon irritated them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after accepting a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they merely kept the entranco until their comrade could return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength decreased rapidly; in two days mortificatjon followed, and the teeth seemed to progress rapidly. His behavior and appearance did not change; he seemed unconscious of pain cls He had been objects on him: but towards the end of the last evening, his urid became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced your help more with morc than the serious vsual—\"Help me! I mean riot of my life, I have heard the death of the exjstence rny as lilte as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey said.—\"I need, but little of my life flourishes, I can't explain the whole thing, but if you hid everything you know from me, the honor rny was free of stain in the world's rnoulh, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence: \"Swear by al1 that your soul resent, by all your fear, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crins or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes were kindled with their bases, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he fell laughing on his protruding, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circumstances saw his arrogance with this man rise up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a chilling cold upon him, as if the presentation of something horribly awaited him. Rifirig early in the morning, he was aboul to ger the hovel in which he had left the body, when a thief met blm, and informed him that he was no longer there, havirigbeen carried by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a neighborhood mountain, according to a promise they had given to his lord, that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after the bif death. Aubrey stunned, taking several of the men, determined to go and bury on the place where he was. But when he counted badly at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or olothes, although the thieves noticed the same rockon that they had laid the body. For this is the moment when his mind was moved into conjectures, but he finally came back, he knew that Thoy had ruined the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a backstage in which he had word with Sueb terrible mistakes, and in whieh a1l apparently conspired to increase this superstitious meIancholy who had grasped his mind, hc resolved to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While he was fighting for a ship to transport him to Otrant0 or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there was one case of several wapaons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were arid daggers. By turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an apparent fheath iy omarnendod in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falale hut—to be frantic—to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror may well imagine that he discovered that he was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; however, he still wanted the particulate form to be dissolved; but the same varying shades on the haft and sbeat were similar in splendor on the bbotb, and left no place for d0ubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lefl Sm yrna, and on his way home, ot Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady ho had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the deportation of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; hc feared that this lady had been the victim of Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only c0nsistedin profession exhorting the speed of postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a bree2e, who seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way to the English coast; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathcrs, and there, for a while, seems to be to be lost, in his sister's aces and caresses, all memory of the past. If she bcfor, by her infanline caresses, bcld gained its effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey didn't have that winning grace that won her eyes and applauded the assemblies of the drawer room. There was none of this light shine that exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was lit vp by the reindeer's levity below. There was a melancholic charm about it that seemed not to come from misfortune, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate a tough soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, that he wandered where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was sedated and pensive. Alone, his face never lit the smile of joy; but when his horo-\nHe breathed his affection, and would have forgotten in his prefence those deed that he knew how to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the thal of volupluclry? It seemed that the eyes, — the face was then playirig in the light of the own nalive sphere. She was still usually eightcens, and had not been brought to the world, it was thought that by her guardian more in the form of her prescntation should be delayed until the relurn of her brother from the counterint, when he could be his Protector. That is why it is now resolved that the next drawing room, which was a quick approach to the irrig, should be the epoch of its entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey preferred to take refuge in the administration of the father bis, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind was fed by the cvents he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive—the pick-up-ro0m had not been held to be a long lime, set in motion all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened there. An idiot was there with his sister. While he was stagnating in the corrier hy himself, the bees from all around him, erupted in remorse that the first tjme he had fen Lord Ruthuen was iri this very place—he suddenly felt feigned by the clrm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remorse your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, afraid of seeing a spocter lhat would explode him, which he poked, to a little dlstance, the same figure that drew bad remark on this place when he first entered society. He threw himself away until his limbs almost pushed back their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and force a crowd-trunked passage, he threw himself irito bis car, and was funny at home. He trampled the room with horrjed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if ho feared that his waste would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven long before him — circumstances began in the dreadfuI painting — the dagger — his oath.—He awakened him, he could not improve him — the dead resurrection again!—Ho thought that bis imagination had conjured up the image of his mlnd was restjng on. It was Jmposslb1e that this was a reality — so he decided to go back to sociology; for he tried to ask about L0rd Ruthven, the name hung up his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few more nights with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and gave to his own devoring bumblebees. When he finally saw that many were leaving, he woke up and entered Anolher's room, with his sister surrounded by many, appeared apprehensively; he tried to pass by arid approach her, when he asked to move, turned around, and went back to hlm these traits, he masturbated in horror. And he went forth, and took his sister's arm, and, with a tainted step, forced her toward the street of Tbe; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were throwing themselves for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again that v0ice murmured near him—\"Remember thy oats-\n\"He dared not turn around, but when he rushed from his sister, he soon returned home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If harassing his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more corollary was jt absorbed, now lbats the croist of the monster's life once again pressed on its acronyms. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to explain to her what had caused her abrvpt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who roasted it. The more he flirted, the more perplexed he was. His oath broke;—was he then to allow this monsler to wander, leading to ruin his bre-\nAnd, in the midst of all that he loved, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and let him disclose suspicions, who would believe him? He was thinking of using his own hand to crush the wor1d with evil; but death, he remembers, had already been mocked. F0r days he remained ln tbis stato; locked in his room, he saw n0 one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, far his sake, to support nature. Finally, rio more able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from stroet to the street, anxious to steal this image that was flouting him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight tames. He was not a loriger to recognize; at first he turned back with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where the fatigue had spilled. His sister, anxious for his safety, entertained people to cool him; but they were soon removed by the hive that fled from a pursuer faster than the ony – from the ght. But his box has changed. Struck by the idea that he lofl by his absence lhe wholo from his friends, with a fiend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious your forearm, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a bluffed hlshaggard and suspicious appearances carried so striking, his inner chills his visible, that his sister was finally forced to turn from him to abstairi to sow, for her, a socjety that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was appropriate to act and, fearing that his mjnd would become alienated, they thought it was high time to resume the truce that had been imposed on them previously by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the jnjuria and sufferings he had encountered in his wanderings, desiring to prevent him from exposing to the marks of the general eye what they would coriside solly, they hired a pbysicist to reside in the house, and take the hard core of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence was finally so great that he was confined to his room. There was often ho for dayf, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had otted a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and reminder that remained appeared on the eristry os his so ster; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, would want her not to lick him well. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your wing for me is great, don't come near him!\" Wheri, however, asked whom he referred to, his only answer was: \"True! True!\" And again ho sank in a state, from which she even was able to wake him up. This lasted for months mary: graduated however, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and the mind hjf threw a cl part of its morosity, while its guardians observed, that the frosty times ln the day would masturbate on bjs fingers a defined number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of selfishness, one of his guards entering his room, stuttered to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubrey's situation being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was goirig the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. GIad of this brand of returnirig intcllect, of whicb they feared that he was doplved, they mentioned the riarno of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be preseritating the nuptials, and eager to drunk his sister. They didn't answer, but iri a few minutes his sjster was with him. He was apparently again able to be asphyxiated by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed to his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, once again flowing at the height of his brother's beirig living with the feelings of afseotlon. He began to speak with al1 his wonted warinthe, and to congratulate him on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprise al observing the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He grabbed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the emblem of her future husband, he looked as if he nat vndersstand her—Tben seizing her hands, and looking on ber with a frantic expression of face, he swore to her that she would never marry that monster, because he—but hc could not advance—it seemed that if lhat voice bado reminded him of his oath—he turned suddenly, thinking L0rd Ruthven approached him but didn't see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought that it was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, begged, begged them to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined having seized the spirit, eradicated themselves to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after the drawing-rooin, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Auhrey's ill health, he learned to be He's cavsus; but when he cried out that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concocted from those among whom he had acquired this irisformation. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant atteridanee, and the claim of great affectivejon for the brother and interest in his fate, he wan gradvilly the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to retract—could speak af hissels as an undivided havirig without syinpathy with ony being on the crowded earth, savc with whom he addressed;—could say how, as he knew her, his exjftence, had 6egun to seem worthy of conservation, if it was simply that he could enumerate his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. As the title of the elder branch falling to Lenglh at HLM, he obtained a major embassy, which served as an excuse for bastenrig the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of ber br0ther,) which was to bring to takc the day before the hif exportation for the counterint.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guards, tried to bribe the fervots, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; jt was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her happiness owri, her own hanour, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who held him in their bristles as their hope and the hope of the house of toil, to delay bvt for some tbatmclrigage burs, 0n which he denounced the heaviest curscs. The servants of Tbe have spoken that they will deliver him; but by giving him to the doctor, he has better not harass the spirit of Misf Aubreyby any more, what he consjdered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest the busy lnmates of the house; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that may be more easjly oonived than described, the notes af occupied prcparatlon. Hello, and the carriage sound broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in extreme French. The curiosity of the servants at the laft ovrearne their vigiIonce, they gradually evaded, leaving him in the cust0dy of be1pless old womari. He seized the opportunity, with bound onc was out of the room, and in a moment found hlmself jn the apartment where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, takirig his arm by wounds, bim pressed srom the coin, without voice with rclge. On the stairs Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Join your oath, and know, except for my fiancée, that your sister is dishonored. Women are srails!\" S0 said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury found no vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, holding the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nBlood effusi0n produced symptoms contrary to the near tooth approach. One could call his sister's guardians, and when he had struck midnight, he wrote down what the reader had perpetrated — he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guard was protected by Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was loo latc. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nREPORT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON,&c.\n\"The world was all in front of the hive, where lo ch0ose his resting room, and Providence his gossip.\"\nIN Sail throvgb tbe Greek Archipelago, aboard one of His Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, iri the island of tbat narne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have there, induces many British ships to visit it — both men of war and inorcbantmen; and instead to fit it off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums largely ropayer for the deviation of a voyage. We dropped; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the purecr trading for cattle with the natives, the clergy and myfelf took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and the othcr places, where wo had been before. On the front of the Ida (a small mo nticvle so named) we met and engaged a Greek y0ung like our gvid, who told us that he had eome fram Scio with an English lord, who left the Islond four days before our ardual to bls felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said Tbe Greek, \"Clnd would have taken rne with him; hut I didn't choose to leave Mitylene, where I'm like 1y to get marricd. He was a weird man, but he was very good. He left him an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 Engljsh currency,) arid recast there about f0urteen montbs, but not constantly; for he sails in his very osten felucca towards the various islands.\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose momentum in the haste at home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a decorated bed, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on the eithor side, a lar ge myrtle in the center, and a fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches of thc by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Venus bronze in a leaning possure; o large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room was a half dozen English canes, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single brush. The bedroom had only one large mattress on tbe float, with two cotton duvets stuffed arid a pillow — the common bed in Greece. In the installation room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with boaks and papers, who were then iri a large box of marinan in the closet: it was a repen, but we do not think we are justified in the examination of the contents. The works of Voltairc, Shakspeclre, Boileau and Rousfeau are finished on the tablet of the re-creation; the Rulns of the Empires of VoIney; Zjmmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 181O; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with inarginal notos, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin ond. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sljps of paper, which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read the lhese books in the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they musl lje until his return; for it is so special, that if I move a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I did it one day; and I have products of his farm for the trouble to take the ear of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of external use of ha was plcasing. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pil1ars of canned marble with black plinths and fret cornices (as it is now usual in Grcian's bow,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Grceks spend the evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the breeze tbe cvening.\nOn the left hand, we enter the house, a sma1l streamlct glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shcld of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on whjchwe were lold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nigbts until the time of the twelvc, reading, wiling, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed because he was truthful, and that he always frequented our chureb twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this soot was what we could call \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to M0unt Calcla, covered with olive trees and blaom inyrte, and on the top of wbich an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic rot. A smail stream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it lasted in the woods near the bass of the mauntain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizori not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view iri front; and a little on the left, through a view of high palm trees clnd chcsnut, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emerald green fpots. I rarely saw more than I did; but our requests were conclusions as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name, but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Army...\nNian, said our conductor, could say it, but I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, if I can,\" he said, \"I daren't.\"We had time to visit the Armenian, bvl on our return to the city we learned several details of isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to the man onc, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the glrls who live by weaving these items. He bought a new boat far away a fisherman wbo had Iost his own in a gclle, ond he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from everything we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and benevolentchclracler. A circumstance that we learned, that our old frierid at the cottage considered appropriate not to dissect. He had a very beautiful daugb ter, with which the lord was often seen wal klng on the shore of the sea, and he had boughl hera piano-forte, and taught him the use of himself.\nThis was the wilh irformation that we left from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our immclgjnations all over the raok, guess who this Greek rain blue could be. He had money jt was obvious: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricitiesthoso that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling with Mr FOSTER, the architcct, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" he said, \"who you are so worried about, if Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island af Tenodos, and I took him to Mitylcne.\" We had then heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had begun a few years from home; but \"ChiIde Harolde\" 6eing put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Ca1cla in each page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our search for eoting, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, disdaining her not entirely uninteresting, and in court to the good riam of her seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. He described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is terribly inverse, like inoy being plairily gathered from these little anecdotes. AlI has finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in his seigneury's poems, seems to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and apprehension to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason f0r rnarkjng hirn as a being on whose heart the religion has scanned his seal, and to ours whose hecld Benevolcnce hastened his manth on. No man can read the \"traits\" of previous pleas without being proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume a right 0 to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a terrible court where all must appear, can not censor the errors of a confrere-mortal. Lord Byrori's eharacter is worthy of genius bis. Making cakes in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous hcart and self-approval.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Flcet-slreet.",
    "24": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very geriatric to the East. Arnong thc Arabians it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of the cbristianity; it took its present form only from the division of the Latln and Greek churches; hect at what moment, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin badger could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it increclsod groudly, arid formed the subject of many wonderful looks, still existing, of the ris ing death of their tombs, and foedirig on the blood of young and bcautious. In the West, it spread, with some variation of weight, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, on Lorraine, where the beIef existed, that the vampyres nig htly soaked a certclinportjon of tbe blood of their uictims, which emaciated the eoarn, have lost their strength, and some die bone consumption; while human tbese bIood-suckers fattened — and the veins of lhelr became distended at such a state of reconstitution, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even of the verypores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Jovrnal of March 1732, is a credible and, of course, eruious account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is declared for hove occvrred in Madreyga, iri Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they have stated positively and without complacency that, with regard to the yoclers of live\nhe, a certoin Heyduke, dwarf Arnold Paul, had beeri heord to say, tbat, in Cassova, on the brothers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, bvt had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, arid rubbing himself to his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from fraternizing a vampyro himself; for, six or twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a deposiliation was made, that four perfons had been deprived of 1feather by his attacks. In order to avoid the furious malformations, the inhabitants of Bavirig consulted their Hcldagni, took tho b0dy, clnd ring (as it is supposed to be usual in the casos of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free corruption of srom, arid emitting to movth, nose, and ears, pure and f1orid bIo0d. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was quite through the heart and heart of Arno1d Paul, where he was turned back from shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his pearl, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the caresses of people who had died in bad times before fr0m vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents upori of other wba survive them.\nThe universal heli is, it is a person sucked by a vampire 6ocomas o vampy himself, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it is better suited to illustrate the svbject of these observations than any other like whieh could be produced. In any part of Greece, it is consjdered as a sorle of punishment after death, if it is a most committed heirly crime that exists, that the deceived riot is condemned only to uampyrise, but obliged to limit its infernal visltations sole1y to those beings that he loved most at the top of a land, those to whom he was bound by the ties of klndred arid affeelion.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from his tomb; and thou hast haunted the place of origin, and defiled the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life: yet hate the banquet which he persecutes Mvst shall feed thy livid living corveh, thy victims, which still exhale, shall know the devil to be sore; as thou cursest them, thy flowers shall be wilt a rod. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will engulf your heart in flame! And yet, the last glasfy g throws sees what freezes his lifeless blue, then, with a hand without Halloween, will tear The braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock on the occasion of the birth of the tenderest engagement of Aff election was worn — But now is carried away by the memorial af lighto agony! But if your owl is the best, it flows; your grinning tooth, and your harging lip; then, chasing to your tomb, go away, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Til1 these in the harror depart from the cursed specter than the thcy.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the young girl of Arabion Oneiza, who was presented as having returned from the tomb of Tobe with the aim of tormonter better loved during his existence. Bvt this cannol being supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a compute type af purity and innocence. Tour's vampyrism gives a long story in his travels of several aslonjshing cases of vampyrism, to which he attaches himself to drooling was an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his groat w0rk on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that he is a classic, as woll as a barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible smoking could be added; tbough thc present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, tbat although the term Vampyre is that in the most general eceplation, lbere are severaI other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT happened trot in the middle of the dissipation of lho on a London wjnter, it appeared to the various parties a for the leaders of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for its singularities, thcln its rank. Hc looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate in thorejn. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into those brcafs that were insensitive. They felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where it lay: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whipping on the face of the objoct, did not seem to penetrate, and the arious gaze to pierce thr0ugh to the inner functioning of the heart; bvt fell0n the chcek with a ray of lcaden that weighed on tho skiri he could not pass. His pocularities invited him into all the houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accused of violent arousal, and who were now engaged in boredom revenge, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging the attentjon. Despite the mortal huo of her fao, who never won a warmer tjnt, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although they were beautiful form and outline, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some marks of the qualification they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the pain of all the monsters she had chained in the dragling rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountain bank, drawing her attention:—but in vain:—when she stood before him, her eyes were apparently fixed on her, he still shook as if they were not seen;—even her vnappal wcls bafouled fornication, and she left the field of thc. But the adulterous commanman could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the sex tho fema1e was indifferent to him: but this was the apparent prudence with whicb he spoke to the uirtuous woman and innocent girl, who sewed knew that he had never addressed hjmsel to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and whether it was that he had 0veroame the fear of his singular choractre, or this tbey carried moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was often among those male feties who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic virtues, bones among lhosc that push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time there was your London a young man named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by the parents wbo diod while being still in childhood. Left to himself by guardians, if they were simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the original importan charge of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, John, this high sense of honor and romaritic candour, which deiIy ruined so many apprentices of mlliners. He all pleaded for spiritual virtue, and thought that vice was cast by Providence more for the plctvresque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: it was tantamount that the misery of an oottage consisted simply of a vestige of clothes, which were as warm, but that we would do better to adapt to the painter's eye by irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of the pocls were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: these reasons, when he entered the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth lheir langvishing or rupturerig favorjles: the donors at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by his sparkling eyccles, when he opened his lips, soon led him to notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the aroma of his lonely hours, he was surprised by the sin, that, except in the tallow and the candles of thal wax clicked, not in fr0m the prcsence of a ghoft, but for lack of snvffing, there was no ringing in the real life for any of these congreries of foldiririg images and dosimbjons contecli in these valours, from which he had sowed his study. Faithful, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the cxtraordinary boing we described above hit him his career.\nHe observed it, and it was very imprudent to form an idea, the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who had few other signs of his observation of cxternal obiecls, that the agreement tacjt to their existence, implied by the avoidance of the contact of man: allowing his imagination to imagine all that tbat flattened his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the heroism of a novel, and determined to observe the outpouring of his fclncy, rather than the person before him. He took hold of him, gave him attention, and so far, in his opinion, advariated that his presence was recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rvthven's clffajrs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous0s obtaining some information respeeting tbis singular character, which, until now, had only whipped his civriosity, he suggested to his guordians, tbat it was time to bim to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been necessary to young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards puttirig themselvos on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, scandalous inlrigues feast are mentioned as sub-jocts of pleasant or os praise, according to the degree of competence they had in the car--\nI ryjng them on. Tbey consented: and Aubrey imrnediatoly mentioning his intentions your Lord Ruthven, wossured your reccive of him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mclrk of esteem of him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other inen, be happy to accept it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrcy had not had the opportunity to study Lord Rutbven's oharacter, and now he has found, tbat, many more of his actions have been expased from his point of view, the results of researching different conclusions of the appear olives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idlo, the vagrant, and the bogie, received from his hand more lhan enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing, that it was the riot vpon the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes of the waiter, even on virtue, that he granted him his alms; — these were sons of the gate of Tbe wilh barely repressed sne ers; but when the profligate caine asked for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to flatter himself in his Iust, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greatest irportunity of vicious tbe, which wields him over the crumbling scorn of virtuous indigents. There was a circumstance about the shariat of his Lordship, which was even more impossed on his mind: all those on whom was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to put the lowest and the most abject misory tob. In Brussels and other cities, through the passage of the city, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent narrowness of his companion, who was looking for the centres of all fashjonable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: to be be wagered, and always played successfully, to seize where the strongest known was his antagonist, then to be lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which ho generally observed the society around: he waf, however, not if, when he encouraged the eruption young novice, or tho chancelesf fathcr os a great family; then hls wish very forlone the law — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of food while dallylng with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursjng, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that had attracted him to the reach of this fiend; while many of a fathor sat frenetic, in the midst of the eyes talking of mute children hurigry, shaking a single farthing of his dead immense wealth, where to buy even sufsicierit to fuel their thirst for prescript. However, it is necessary to take money rio from the game table tob; but jmmediatley Iost, to the ruincrof a lot, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: that night but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich was not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most experiential. Aubrey oflen wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged Hiin to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend for his own profit;—bvt he delayed him—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and ricb scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lipot; and although Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he did not gratify only the dismaying excitement of whipped vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his c0mpanion; he left him in the presence on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he was crying in search of the inemorials 0f anotber almost deserted cily. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from hiftister, breathing nothing from the hut faction; the others came from bis guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination bis that there was a eurel of power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough reas0n for the belies. His guardians insisted that he immediately leave bis sriend, and exhort, that his character was terribly vicious, for the Possation of irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious bacits inore dangerous to your society. It turned out wrong, that his contempt for adultery had not been born of a hatrode of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to revive his gratification, that bis vietim, the partner of his guilt, should rush from the plennocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, all the women whom he had fought, apparently on the account of their virlue, had, from his departure, set aside the same mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey suspected a bezel whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invcnt somo plclusible pretext to abandon it completely, purposive, in the meon whiie, to watch it more c1osely, and let not light circumferences go unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordsbip was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with the company jn; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in al1 his windings, and soon distraught that an assignment had been designated, which wovld mast probably ended in the ruin of the annocent, although the gir I. Don't waste time , he entered Lord Ruthven's party, and suddenly asked him for his iritentions of the lody, insorning him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to have him that night. Lord Ruthven replied, that his intentions were such that he would all have thrown himself on such abhorrent aris; and after having been pressed if he would go to marry him, only laughed. Aubrey withdraw...\ned; and, immediately writing to notc, to say, from that moment on, he must disappoint accompanying his Lordsbip in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his seruanl to look for other apartments, and rocking on the lady's mother, informed him of all heknew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also ooncerning him cartaoter de bis Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthuen the next day merely sent his servant t0 to notify his complete consent to a separati0n; but did not suggest any suspense of his plans having been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey took his steps towards Greece, and crossed lhe Peninfula, quickly found luiseIf al Athens. He then repaired the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimsclf by tracing the faded traces of ancient glory on monumcnts thclt apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freemon tbe only bosore sloves, had hidden themselves beneclth the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof is attached himself, there exists a beautiful and delicate being, which she could have formed tho model fora painter wanting to spread on the carivass the promised hope of the faithful in the paradise of Mohammed, except that her eyes frown too mirid for anyone you think that it could belong to those who had no soul. As shc danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thaugbt the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for whom would have exchanged his eye, appareritly the eyec of the nature of animatod, for thclt luxurious sleep l0ok of the anjma1 suitable but to taste an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursujt of a kashmere butterfly, would show all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, in the eyes of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased lablet, in the contemplation of his sylpha figure. Often, his braids fell, weakened, displayed him in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the shades, he might well excuse the oblivion of tbe clntiquary, which let escape from his mind the abiect of the Uery which he had before tb0uht vital importance for the correct interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, that no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, tutb and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew these whieh ho novels, he wanted to prescrve a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, arid looking at the magic of his penciI, by drawing the scenes of his natjve place; she would then describe to him the dance encircled on the operating plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage which she remembered to look at in her childhood; arid theri, lunning to the subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural tales of his laugh. Her fervour and her apparent vanity of what she laughed expiated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as she had cut off the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her frieds, and the most dear ties, before each year, by attaching to the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he stunned for the laughter of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of old men, who had finally noticed that 0ne liing between them, after the knowledge of their close relatives had been found of children marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fiend; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe it, for he had pointed out, that those who had dared to seek the existence of the Jr, had always found proof that forced them, with pain and broken heart, to confre themselves. She stripped him of the traditorial appearance of these monsters, and his horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord Rulhven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered for many coincidences that had all tended to exoite a Hellef in the supernatvral power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Iclnthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought the vision af romanoe, wori his heart; and while being ridiculod tbe idea of a young man of skilled English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still faund hesolf plus and moro attached to thc almost form of fairy before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins the arourid, wilt in his mirid, he killed the image cln which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and he always had the same frank child he had known firsl. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but she was unhappy because she had no more than 0ne with wbom, she could visit her favovrite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a frclgment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject af Vampyres, and both, with several prefects, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey was cutcrmined t0 proceed vpon one of his excursions, whincb had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the room, they all begged him not t0 rctturns at night, as he must unjustly pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, clfter the day had eclipsed, on any consideration. They deserinated it as the resort of the Uampyre in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils like impending on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their rehearsals, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently caused the blood to freeze, ho was silent.\nNoxtmorning Aubrey went on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and he was concerned that his pupils, mocking the belief of these perverts, had inspired them to such terror. When he fought, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night was over, allowing the power of the TBsian beings to be pulsed in action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that iri thc horizon therc was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted land.—He finally, hawen, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but he was too lal. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost uriknawn; immediately the sun sets, the nigbl begins; and it had advanced far, the storm's power was above – its thunders failing had barely a resting interval – its heavy rain forced the passage through the enveloping foliage, while the blue highling of fourkcd seemed to fall and radiate at its own feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible thrugb speed the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighbourh0od of a hovcl which did not itself list masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surround it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust a storm shelter. As he approached, Thehunderf, for a while silent, allowed him to hear the horrors of a mirigling woman wilh thc stifled, the exuberant mockery of a laugh, cortinued in a s0und almost uribroken;—he was scattered: but, eaten up by tho thundcr who rolled again on the head bis, he, with a hard effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself sounds in darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not aware of it; for, although he called, the sounds were still heard, and nothing was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, he immediately split; when a voice cried out: \"Agaïri floundered!\" to which he succeeded a great laugh; and he went to the hands of a man whose foot seemed superhuman: determined to sell the bise as expensive as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on him, and knelt on his head, had seized his hands on his beats — when the brightness of many torchcs penetrating through the hole that gave the light in the day, disturbed him; — he rose up angryly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the bruhahahahahahahahahahahahahaha, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. Tbe's storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by tbose without. They cling to the light of their torches falling on the wall of the mud, and of the stubble charged on each straw with soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he turned into darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again b urst on bim, to perpetuate the aerial form of his beautiful canducer brandished a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; bul he saw again the same sleep, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; yet tbere was a silence above his fece, which splattered almost as fondly as the life that once dwolt thore: — on his neck ber and chest was blo0d, and upori his throat were the marks of leeches having opened the vein thc: — to that the meri pointed, weeping, simultaneously floated with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter box was formed qujckly, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had latcly been to him Tbo object of so many brigbite and airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in it. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was flouted and seemed to run away from the reflection, and take charge of the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had found 6th in the cabin. They were sunny by different parts that had been engaged in the sea bones her that a mother had missed. Tbeir weeps lamentably, as they approached the city, warning the parents of a terrible catastrophe. —Explore their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the thoir child's dcathe, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsequential; both died in the heart of brokon.\nAu6rey boirig put to bed was seized with a vlolen fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a responsible coin he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare being that he loved. At other times, he would permeate the curses on his hoof, and curse him from his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from the whaler's motive, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered in his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whom he had the image of a Vampyre, Lord Ruthven bul, by his kind words, involving almost repentant for tbe fault which had caused their separation, and still inore by the attention, the arixety, and the nucleus which he showed, soon rcconcjd his presence. His seigneury seemed to be changing; he only appeared to be an aptistic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but cls son that the convalesconce of hjf began to be fast, he regradua1y retired lnto the same stote of mind, and Aubrey pierced rio differentencc from the former man, was surprised that sometimes he met his ga2e fixedly on him, with a smile of maliciovs exu1tation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the Inualid, Lord Rvtbven was apparently committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of the lhose orbs, clinging, like our world, to the still svn;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of a1l.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was much weakened, and lhat elasticjty of the mind that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find jt jn tho near Athons; if he were to do so in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequered, the form of Ianthe stood at his faithfulness — if he sought him in the woods, his stepight would be appeclr wclndering amjdst theunderwood, in search of the inode st violet; then suddenly, turned around, would show, to his wild imagination, out of pale face and wounded lhroot, with a small touch on his lips. He deleminated to steal scenes, every bone window that created such bitter associations jn his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, that he had been bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they had not yet seen those parts of Greece. They dragged in all directions, and sought every place where a memory could be attenuated; but while they hastened from one place to another, they did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to shed light on these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of iridividuels, whose interest was to expel the generosity of those they defended from pretoned dclngers. As a result of this neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, for a moment they were lurking with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as deferries. At the time of taking hold of it, howevcr, a narrow defilement, to which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly all the party engaged in the narrow pclss, when tbey were fertled by hissing tbe bul1ets bones cling to their head, on the ratio echoed af several cannons. In an insound, their guards had left them, and by placing them behind rocks, they had begun to take the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Auhrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, withdrew for a moment behind lho by sheltering the bend of defilement; but shameful to be so shot down by an enemy, who, with cries of lnsvlt, advanced them, and being explained to a enslaved, if one of the thieves were to ascend above and take them to the rear, they decided once to rush forward in fcarch 0f the enemy. They lost the shelter of the rock, when the Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his distrust; and, longer to meet or to his own peril, saon was surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rvthven being thrown, immediately threw their arid arms away.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cclbin; the havjng agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence of beeir — they were keeping the entrance until tbeir c0mrade returned with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength declined rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. If the conduct and appearance bcld nol changed; it seemed that there was no awareness of the pain towards him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his osten of the eye on Avbrey, who was accustomed to his help with more serious usua1—\"Help me! You can enchant me — you can do more tbari lhat — I don't mean my lfe, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the day passiririg; but you can save my honor, the horror of your friend. \"\"H0w? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need a hut, I need my life, I can explain everything to you.\"But if you were to hide me, you know me, my honor was free of stain in the rnout of the world, and my death has been unknown for some time in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, crying violently: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature, swear that during the year and one day you will not communicate your knowledge of my life or death to any living being in any way, a whaler may occur, or a whaler that you can see. \"His eyes seemed to spring out of their bases: \"I swear!\" Sclide Aubr...\nHe sank laughing on his pillow, and didn't breathe any inores.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but djd did not sleep; the many eruptions that attended his trick with this man upori his inind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, the shivers of gold came upon him, as if it came from the presentation of something horrifying to hold him. Rjsing early in the morning, he was obsessed with entering the coffin in which he had left the body of lho, when a thief met him, arid informed hlm that he was no longer there, havjng was transported by himself and the cornades, at his retirement, your pinacy of a neighbour movnt, according to cl prornise that they gave his seigneury badly, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the rnoon that arose after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and took several of the men, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the svmmit, he found no trace of eltbering the body 0r the ciothes, although the robbers swore that they were penetrating the identjcal r0ck on which they had placed the body. For a timo his mind was perplexed in conjections, for he finally came back, convjrified that they had drunk the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWoe to a country in which he had melancholy with such terrible evils, and in whjch all apparently conspired to raise this superstitious melancholy who had seized his mind, he breathed to leave him, and soon arrived at Sinyrna. Wbjle, waiting for a ship to send him to Otranto, or to Naples, took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there were several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dclggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and oxamining curious forms, the whale was surprised to find a puff apparently adorned in the same stylism as the dagger discouraged in the fat al hut — he trembled — seized the furious proof, he found the weapon, and his horror rnay bc imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, albeit in shape, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need greater certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted no one to believe; but the pcltricular form, the same different shades on top of the haft and the sheath were similar in the splendour ori botb, and left the rio place to doubt; there were drops of ori blood each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back, clt Rome, the first investigations checked the lady that he mistried the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distros, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of hjs lordsbip. Aubrey's spirit became almast broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of the Ianthe destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lift of some expensive hcld hc. Arrived at Calais, a breezc, who seemed obedient to the will, soon threw him on the shores of the Eng1ish; and he hastened to seize the home of his fathers, and the lrc, for a moment, seems to lose, iri the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by his infantile caresses, he acquired his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an eompanion.\nMiss Aubrey is not the winning grace that wins against and applause from the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exjsts Iri only the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the heneath tbe spirit. There was a melancholic charm that obeyed it, which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a few tributaries inside, which clinged to indical a soul consequently of a brighter kingdom. His step wasn't so light, which misleads a 6utterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smilo of joy; but that his brother grated to his affection, arid wanted in his presence to forget these claws She knew that he had flouted his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — the face was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not seen 6 presperity in the world, he was overwhelmed by hcr guclr dianf more appropriate than his presentation should 6 delay the return of a brother of unti1 hcr from the continerite, that he could have his protector. It was now that noxl's lounge, whieh, approached quickly, moved away from its entrance into the interior of the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would have stayed in the nation of fathers, and fed on the melancholy that conquered him. Ho could feel iriterest abducting the frivolities of the fashionablo foreigners, when hjs injnd had been so torn by the events he had seen; bvt he discouraged to sacrifice his own comfort to pr0tection of his sisler. They soon entered the city, and prepared for the day noxt, which had been announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was exoessive: a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened to die. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaging in tho remembranoe that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthveri was in that same plaee, he suddenly felt seizod by his arm, and a voice that he rebuked tao well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your oath.\" He had the hard turn of the courtago t0, fearful of seeing irig cl spectrum that would explode him, when he pierced, at a distance from litlle, the same figure that had drawn attention to this place at his first int0 entry socicty. He looked at his members almost by refusing to be their wig-\nht, he began to take the torch of a friend, and forced a passage through the crowd, and threw it in his car, and returned home. He hastened with steps and fixed bis' hands on his head, as if he feared his sighs would burst out of his brain. Lord Rulhven agairi before he — cjrcustances begun in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath.—He mocked himself, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead were resurrected again!—He thought his mclgination had concirced upwards of the immogene his mind rested on. It was impresible that it could be real — so he decided to return to int0 society; for although ho tried to ask to conceive Lord Ruthven, the name sung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the insormation. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and there he gave himself to his devouring dicks. At last, when he saw that mony was fainting, he woke up, and adorning another room, found his sister svrovnded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach the ber, when onc, who was asked to move, turned around, and straightened up to him the traits of tbose which he masturbated in horror. And he went forth, and shook his sister's arm, and in haste gave him up to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was busy passing them, he heard this voice murmuring with him again: «Remember your oath!»\nAubrey 6ecame almost got distracted. If beforc his mind had been absorbed by a subject, h0w much more complete1y was he absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thought. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what caused her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, ond thosc terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His aath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin on his chest, in the middle of al1 to be held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister vcry may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would upset him? He thought he would use his own hand to extirpate the world from such misery; the death of a hut, he recalled, had already been mocked. F0r days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he sowed no one, and ate only when bjs sister came, who, with eyes full of tears, begged bim, for her, to beg nature. Finally, he is no longer able to accommodate himself of calm and solitvde, he is first his hause, moved from street to street, anxious to f1y that the image wbibb haunted him. His dress ravaged, and he wandered, as osten exposed t0 the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for security bif, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him wbo fled from a pursuer faster than any thought-fram. His conduct, rainbow, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all the bis friends, with a siend among them, of the presence of which they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and to watch him closely, anxiovs to anticipate, in the spy of his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimcence. But if he entered a room, his discontented and rogue eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that struck him so hard. When, in fact, remission proved to be unwavering, the guards intervened and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they believed that it was high time to regain the trust that had previously been imposed upon them by the parerants of Avbrey.\nDesiring to save the hiin from the insults and sufferings he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing himself to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor t0 resident in the h0use, and tako coristont takes care of him. It did not appear t0 to notice, so completely was the mind hjs absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great, that he found the room of inconsistency. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and of the remaining lection displayed ite1f at the entrance of his sisler; tben he would start somctjines, and, sewing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if you love me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she spoke to whom he resisted, her only answer was: \"Truly! True!\" Orid again he sank in a state, which couldn't even roam it. It's been several months: gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies have become less frequent, and its spirit has cast a part of its shadow, while its obscured guardians, as the moments of villains in the day it lurks on hif fingers a defined numbor, and then srnil e.\nThe time had almost passed, when, vpon the last doy of the year, one of his guardians inherited his room, began to covet with his doctor on the melancholy oircumstance of the beirig d'Aubrey in such a horrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Irisotly Aubrey was attracted to the ottention; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this brand of returnjrig inteIlect, bones that they faked it had been depraved, they set up the name of tbe Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in sooity, Aubrey seemed to plead, and astonished them even more by expressing his bis intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. Thoy didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently able agcljn to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his hreast, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished as to arid rank each acoomplishmcnt; when he suddcnly perceived a lockot on his chest; to open it, which unhappily his surprise to see the features of the monster who had long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On hor askirig him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her fvture husband, he looked as if hc did not understand her — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frantic espresson of Countrice, he told her to swear that she would not like to marry this monster, because he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that this v0ice made him remember once again his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard what was, and who thought that he was only a return from his disorder, attracted him, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to disdain him. Ho fell on his knees to them, he begged, he screamed like them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the unsanitaryness they imagined had symbolically the possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Rulhven had called the mother after the sitting room, and had been refused with all the others. When he seized Aubrey's calamity, he easily realized that he was the cause; but when one learns that ho was considered a jnsane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed snoring those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by constant presence, and by the claim of great affection for the 6rother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who is covld resisting power bis? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an iridividual havjng no sympathy with the ony or the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself;—could say how, as he knew her, her existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not tbat he migrated to listen to his soolhing accents;—iri well, he kries so well how to use the art of the lho serpent, or such was the will of fatc, thor tot he won ber affections. The title of the elder branch falls to him at length, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was lo tclke place the day before his departure to contirient him.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe the scrutinists, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a pclper; it was given to him; he wrolea letter your hjs sister, eonjvring her, os she enjoyed her own bclppinoss, her own honaure, and the honor of lhose now in the grave, which anone held her in their arms as their hope and the boop of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marjage, on which he denounced the most cursed cursed. The servants of Tbe promised that they would deliver him; 6and give him your doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's spirit any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the hour; clnd Aubrey heard, with horror that the hub was designed more easily than described, the node of the occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of br0ke carrjages on the bis ear. Auhrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame Iheir vigilarice, he gradually moved away, leaving him inch guard of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with an affair was out of the ro0m, and in cl moment faund himself in the apartment where he was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him, and immediately he took his arm by force, and cast him out of the ridge without a voice with the rag. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your aath, and know, if my fiancée does not want to do, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his allies, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was sent to 6ed. It wasn't his sister's schoolwork, who wasn't there when we came in, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bridal and the husband left London.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; the outpouring of prodvc symptoms of blood af near approximate death. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated — he died immediately afterwards.\nTho's guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; bvt wben they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's siftcrhad slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nTHE ACCUEIL OF LORD BYRDN RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world awaits him, where to choose his place of rest, and the guide of Providence.\"\nEN Sailing thrugb tbe Grcian Archipelago, aboard one of its ships Mcljesty, in the year 181z, we put irito the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this piece, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables a1ways to be used, induce mary ves salts British to visit it, both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather above the track sor ships linked lo Smyrna, its premiums reimburse a great deal far the distance of a voyage. We disembarked, as usual, at the bottam of the bay, and as the rren became involved in the water, and the sacriller negotiated for the cattle with the shipwrecked, the clergy and I took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and to other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (cl small mound so narrated) we met and engaged the young Groek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island day before our arrival in his felucca. \"He struck me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he would have taken me to look for him.\" I didn't choose to leave Mltylene, where I might get married. He was a weird man, but a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails his felucca very after the various islands.\"\nTbis ran into our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose lime in the haste to the haufo where 0ur peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who drove us over a private hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, in the entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were simply decorated: Greek walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a smileful smail underneath, which could be made to play through the branches 6y movirig a spring fixed in the side of a sma1l bron2e Venvs jn a lean pasture; a large sofa or s0fa completed the furnipper. In the room were held stalls a dazeri EngIish cclnechs, and an empty casc book: tbere were not mirrors, nor a single pairing. The bedroom had only one large mattress on the floor, with two stuffed colton duvets and one pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, unfortunately, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, who then in the trunk of a great sailor iri the closet: it was open, 06:00 We did not think that our own elements were justified by the examination of their content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire's, Shakespeare's, Boileau's, ond Rousseou's warks comp1ete; Volney's Ruins of Empjres; Zimmermori, jn the German language; K1opstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's noveIs; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Parcldise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, muoh t0rn, but no English book of any description. Most of the lhesis books were filled with marginal notes, written in pencil cl, Italicln and Latln. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and truffled with sheets of paper, one that also wero romarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had sew these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot your place with others; but there he must lie vntil his return; for he is so special, that if I move a thing without order, he would sling me for a week together; he is in other ways vcry goad. One day I did him a service; and I have the charge of this farm, and I have the penalty of the king, twenty zechins, whom I pay to an elderly Armenian who dwells in a little cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for what reasori.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and broad fovrteen, and the pillars of marble canned with black pInthes and work carnices of frets, (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) wcre consjderally higher than thcln roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stono halustrade, was covered with a beautiful procession from Turkey, under the annoulage of coarse strong linen. Most of the aro top houses thus furnished, as on the cm the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking ligbt wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating frvit, and enjoying the evenjng breeze.\nOn the back hand, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees gathered t0gother on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, o marble seat with an ornamental wooden back plaoed, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and takirig to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very pious, that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday.\"\nThe view of this seat was what he could sneeze \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covering olive wjth and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesto decomposition. A small stream that emitted water into the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the baso of the movntajn. The srnooth sea as glass, and a horizori not overshadowed by a singlelc cloud, lermines the view in front; and a little on the left, thrugb a v ista of noble cbesnut and paIm-lrees, several islands srnal1 woro distinotlyobserved, studdjng the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than what I did; bvt our requests were fruitful on the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name bis but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our tough man, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't,\" he said, \"and you'll tell the cannol, old friend,\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared the young girls eigbt when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, borses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by boasting these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamentf to poor children. In short, he presented himself to us, from clil we have eollected, for having been very ecceritrjc and the character blieuolent. A circumstratory we have learned, which our old friend at the Eottclge considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island af Mitylene; our imaginations everything on the rack, guessjng that crawling them in Greece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philanthropy of dispositiori, and all the eocontricities lhose that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in c0mpany with Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who hcld traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"Tbe individual, sald him, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the farne of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Hclrolde\" being pul in the hands of ovr we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Didn't we regret not having been more eurious in our research on the cottage, but we became corisolated with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the day of the future, but to me that day I will come back. I'm making this statement. He is not entirely intimidating, and in justice to the good reputation of his seigneury, which was grossly gloomy. It has been described as an unsightly disposition, contrary to the association with human nature, or able in any way to appease his sorrows, or add t0 his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as rnoy be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderncss, syinpathy and charity seem to guide all his actions: ond his participation in the rest of loneliness is an additional reason to mark him as a boing on whose heart Religiori put his seol, and on which the hoax Berievolence threw his annuitant. No man has read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without being proud of him as a peasant. Wilh respects his love or pleasures, I do not aspire to a right to give an opiniori. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this horrible court wbero all must a pear, only can censor the errors of a martel. Lord Byron's character is w0rthy of hjs geriius. Making the right secret, and escaping the opplause of the world, is the truest testimony of a virtuous and self-approving conversation.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "25": "VAMPYRE;\nA T1e.\nBy John Williain Polidori\nTHE superorstitlon vpon that this lale is founded is very general in the Eclst. Among the Arabs he appears to be in common: he did not, however, extend his sons to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiaria; and he did not assume his present forrn from the TB division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming prevalenl, that a body of Lcltin could not corrupt if it was buried on their territory, he increased gracefully, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, he fainted, with a slight varialion, a1l ovr Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the night vampyres jmbibed a cerlain porlion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strerigth, and quickly died of consumptions; while these blood-suokers-hvman fattened—and their hecamed veins were distended to such a state of repletian, as cavse the blood to fascinate from all passages of their bodios, and even pores even from their skins.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March 1973, is curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular ease of vampyrism, wbich is slaled for having taken place in Mcldreyga, Hungary. It appears that, during the examination of the commander-in-chief and the rnagiflrates of the place, they unanimously affirmed, that about five years earlier, a certairi Hcyduke, riamed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating the somo of the earth from the grubbing of the vampyre, and rubbing his sons with blood of hjs. Precaution, however, does not prevent him from being a vampyre himself; for, abovt t goy or thirty days to fly his affair and burial, many people complained of being torpedoed by the hiin, and a statement wos made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove other malices, the inbabitants who have consulted their Hadagni, tap the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in vampyrism cases) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emit to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. The proos hauing were thus obtained, they resorted to the Ibe customed roinedy. A stake was led entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, where it is reported lovc also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and cast his body, and cast the asbes into his grue. The same measures were adopted with the corses of people who had already died fram vampyrism, I am that they should, iri l'ir turri, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vclmpyre bocome a vampyre hesels, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis rodomontade moristrouf is linked to a hero, it is better suited to illustrate the subject of the observations presontes thari any other instance that could be clducated. Iri of many parts of Greece it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a erime heiress committed while in existenco, thal the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his visits jnferna1 only to the beings he loved most while he was on clrth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and effect.—A suppofition alludes to in the \"Giclour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent him, Your horn comes out of his tomb, and you haunt the rite, and you suck the blood of all your offspring; from there, from your daughter, sister, wife, to the drain rnidnight tho slream of life; yet the trick of the banquet that performs must feed your living corfe, Your victjms, they still expire, Sball knowtho deinon for their sire; as the cursed Shoe, you curse them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. Bvt a tbat for your crime must fall, The y0ungest, the best beloved of all, Will it not be 6c with the name of a fclther — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet, lbou must follow your task and mark the last tint of his cboek — his last spork eye, and the 1st glassy glclnce must see who sneezes his lifeless blue; then with a hand without defilement will tear the braids of his ycllow hair, including, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried—But now is barne far from you Memoria1 of your agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth and thy lip shall heap; and after thy sullen tomb, go, and with Gouls and Afrils rave, until these in horror depart from the cursed Inore Speclre that tbey.\nMr. Soulhey presented alsa in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyre oorse of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as havlng came back from the grave in order to torment him whom she loved while exiled. But this cannot be plentiful for having resulted from the sinfulness of his life, sbe being spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and jnnocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account of several amazing cases of vampyrism, which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Ca1met, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illuslrative of his efsects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbarism.\nMariya curious and interesting noties about this singularly borri6lo fuperstition could be added; although the presenl may suffice for tbe limitf of a note, neesesarjly dedicated to explanaljan, clnd which can now be concluded hy simply remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are severa1 other synonyms with lt, makes use of in different parts of the world TB: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIT happeriod that in the inditut of dissipations accompanying on a London winter, it appeared to the various parties of the tbe leaders of the ton a nableman, m0re remarkable for its singularities, that the rank hif. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laugbtor 0f the fair attracted only the hisattcntion, so that he could by a look thatll he, and thr0w fear in those breasls where the unwisesf reigned. Thofe, who felt this admiration, could not explain where she came from: some attributed him the deod grey cye, which, staring on the ace of the object of Tbe, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to picrce thr0ugh to the inner wheels of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a lea den rcly which weighed on the skin he could not pclss. His peculiarities made Bim be invited to every hosc; all wanted to split him, and those who had been used to the exciting violence, and now felt the weigbt of boredom, were ploughed to have something in their presence capable of engaging their atlention. Iri despite the bitten hue of her face, which never took on a warmer hue, eithcr of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her shape and contours were fabulous, mary of the feminine hunt after the notoriety aspired to gain her attentions, arid gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been mocking all the monsters of the drawing rooms since her marriage, pierced himself in her way, and did anything but put on a tbe dress of a montebank, to attract the attention of hjs:—although in vairi:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that if they were not seen;—even her unimplemented impudence was flouted, and she left her field. But although the Cammon adullator cannot influence even the gourdine of his eyes, it is not that the femalo sex is indifferent to him: yet, it was an apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, tal little knew that he was speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winnirig language; ond if it was that jt even overcame the fear of his singular eharacter, or that they were moved by hjs apparently hatred of vice, he was also often among the women who formed the boast of their sex of their domcslio virtues, cls among those who su1ly by their apparatuses.\nAt about the same time, a young gentimon named Aubrey arrived in London: being an orphan left with one sister in the position of great wealth, by porents who died while still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortvne, while they abandoned the more false accusation of his rnnd to take care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination than his judgment. That is why he had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so many apprentices of a thousand thousand. He believed in sympathy with virtue, and thought that vice was tbrown jri by Providence only for the images of the scene, as we see in the rannances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply by revealing clots, which wer as hot, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various olorated patches. He says, in firie, that the poet's dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay circles, all the mothers subjugated him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or crawling favourites: the girls of the same time, hy their grinning faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merlt. Attached as he was to the romance of his salitary h0urs, he was scattered to find, lhat, except in tbc tal0w and candlcs of wax that freaked out, not from the presence of a ghost, but from lack of snuffing, there was no furnace in the real lifo for one of these assemblies os plisirig pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, srom that he had formed his study. Discovering, above, a somcious compensation in his gratified vanity, it was lowered to bring down his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, crossed him in his caretaker.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few olfactory signs of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence once, implied by the avoidance of the incontlct: allowing his imagination to imagine all that fatterod is propensity your extravagant ideas, he so0n forined lhisobject in the hero of a romance, and determined lo to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before hlm. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and if sar moved on to his point of view, his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was full of courage to travel. Desirous of acquiring the computeristic family respocting this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was time for him to perfuse the tour, which for many generations a beeri lhougbt did not need to enahle young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if hallen from the sky, whenever scondalous irilriges are mentioned the subjects of p1easantry or os praises, cling to the degrek of competence chewn iri relating them to them. They slid; and Aubrey immediately became interested in Lord Ruthven, and was surprised to deny him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the otber men, he readily accepted it, and a few days they had passed tbe circling waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, tal, thaugb much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclvsionf patterns apparent to the conduct of hls. His componion was abundant in his liberality; — the idle, lhe vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than in 0ugh to satisfy their immediate needs. But Avbrey could not avoid romarrer, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indigence 6y the accompanying misforlunes even on uirtuc, tbat he breathed hjs aums;-it were scint from the door with sneezes barely removed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him still into his iniqvlty, bc was sent away with rich charity. It was, no doubt, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally predominates in the retirement of the virtuous needy. There were ono circumstances about the charity of her Lordship, which waf still moro impressed on her mind: all those on wh0m it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for it was ail either led to scaffolding, or sunk to the lowest and the most clbject misery. In Brussels and other countries through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companions sought the toes of all the fashionable vices; there he entered the whole spirit of the Faro table into the irito: he bet, and always spoiled with svcs, except where the known tbe more sharp was antagonistic hls, and then he lost cven more than he won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, when he met TBerosh young novice, or the fathcr without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed the love of Fortuno — this apparent abstraction of the wos spirit set aside, and his eyes shone with morcque fire than that of tbe cat who dallyjng with the half-morte moso. In each city, he left the old influent youth, torn from the circus which he worshipped, cursed, in the madness of the dungeon of cl, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this hell; while in any case a father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single piece of his immense wealth latc, where to buy even sufficed to satisfy their preferred desire. Yot did not take money from the lab1e garnbling; but immediately lost, in the roar of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the inrocent: it could but be the result of some damage of knowledge, wbich was not, however, able to combat the incoherence of the most experiential. Aubroy often wanted to represent him to his friend, and jostling him to resign thal charjly and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring him to his own profit; — but he delayed him — for the day he made his sriend would give him the opportunity to speak frikly and openly to hiin; however, this never happened. The Lord Rulhven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke to him as his lip; and although Aubrcy wos near the object of his curiosity, ho ohtainod no greater gratification of her thari the constant excitation of vain1y wanting bereclk this mystery, which to his oxidized imagjnaliori began the appearance of something supernatura1.\nThoy soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a time, lost the sight of his companion; he threw him into daily attendance on the morbid circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memoriclls of another almost deserted cily. While he was so engaged, the letters orviated fram England, wbioh he operia wilh impatient avid; the first was torn his sisler, breathing riots but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter ostonna; if she had previously entered into irito his imagination that there was a power evjl resident in hif eompanion, these seemed to give bim sufflcian reasori for belief. His guardians insisted on his jmmedjately leavirig his friend, became excited, his character was terribly vicious, because the p0session of irresistible p0wers of sedvction, made his licensorous habits more dunger to society. It had been discovered that the bi-scorn for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to give his satisfaction, that his victim, the associate of the guilt of hjs, be driven out of the pinnacle of the unveiled virtvo, to the lowest abyss of the infomie and degradati0n: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently in account of their virtue, had, from bis sorbre, thrown even a tbe mask from the side, and had no scruples to expose all the desormity of thcir vicos to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined by leaving one, which character had not yet shown a light point finglc on which to refute the eye. He resolved to invent the p1ausible prelext for a 6andoning bim, to aim, in the sense, to monitor it more closely, and lo did not let pass the circumstances of the fly without attention. He's...\nIn the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with the iri society, so he was forced to pursue his plclns in scpret; Auhrey's eye f0lowod him in all his wjndings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent girl, although there is nothing. Not losing any tjme, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, arid abruptly asked bim his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the very hour that he was aware of his being about t0 meeting her that very riigbt. The Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything was going to have on such an attack; and after having been precised if he irimeted to marry ber, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and immediately wrote a note, los say, that from that moment on must be dcc1in accompanying his Lordship in the rest of the tour proposed, he ordered his servant to look for other opartments, and calling to the mother of the lady, informed him of Oll hc knew, not only as regards his daughter, but als0 regarding the characler of his Lordship. The assignment was made. The next day Lord Ruthven merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a seplation; but he did not cast doubt on his plans baving heen thwarted by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the Peninsvla, soon fovnd bimself at Athenf. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to trace the erased documents of ancient glory on the Tbat MONVEMENTS apparently, as bones chronicling acts of freedom only as slaves, had hidden themesselvos bcneath tbe sheltering sojl or colorful rnany ljehen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she formed the modcl for a painter relying on canvoss the promised hap of the faithful in the poradise of Mohammed, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that sho could bolorig to those who do not have sovls. As she danced plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have expended his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this deluxe look asleep from the antal bulb adapted to the tasto 0f an epic. Ianthe's walk was often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquitjes, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere 6uttersly, would show all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the Ietters that he had just dccypber on an effaced tablet of alrnost, in the contemplation of his sylpha figure. Ofton wanted her braids to fall, while she was wilting ar0und, exhibiting in the ray of the sun such bright and quickly soothing shades, he might well excuse the oblivions of the antiquarian, which tore from his mlnd the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why try to describe charms that all feel, hut no crook appreciate?—He wcls innovation, youth, and beauty, unaltered 6y overcrowded drawing-roamf and stifling balls. If he drew the bones that he wanted to keep a memorial for his future executioners, she stood by, ond looking at the magjc effects of his pencil, in traoing the scenes of his native plocée; sbe would then describe to him the dance encircled on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors like the young renemory, the marriage pump that she remembered seeing irig in her childhood; and then, tuming to svbjectf who had obviously made a greater jmpression on her mind, would tell hlm all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her gains and her apparent belef of what she was telling, aroused the euen interest of A ubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vclmpyr, which had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the lily of a feincl1e limb to prolong her existence during the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her such idle and horrible fantasies; bvt Ianthe quoted at hjm the names of the old men, who had at 1st detected one living among them, aftormed several thoir near the relotters and children had been found marked with the buffer of the fiend's appetite; and that he found it so new, she begged to believe her, for he had been noticed, that those who had dared their existence, had always had giuen evidence, which forced them, with grief and tear, to feel true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid her boundor was incrusted, hearing a fairly acvrate description of Lord Ruthuon; he, h ledver, still persisted iri persuadirig her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocenco, so contrasted with all the virlues affected by the womcn among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hif heclrt; and while hc ridiculed the idea of a young man usually English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he still found hese1f m0re more attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for a clinticular rosary, he would leave, decided not to return until his abject was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention bis the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Iantho was unconscious of his love, and was always the same unconscious Francoist he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but she was wrong because she no longer had someone with whom she had visited her fascist haunts, wbilst her guardian was busy sketching or discovering the fragment of somo that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided that one of his cxcursi0ns had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, as he must neo-cssively pass through a wood, where no Grcek would ever remain, after the bad day closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the m0 the heaviest evils as imminent at the top of the one who seized to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock himself in this way with a superior, iriferal power, whose very name had apparently frozen the blood of Tbeir, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy foce of his host, and was alarmed that the words hif, maoking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them from such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe Caïne, on the side of his horse, and earnestly praying to return, the past night allowed the pagan of these beings0 to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his repulsiveness, that he did not see that the light of the day was coming to an end, and that in the hori2on there, one of those wbich flies, in the wclrmer climates, assembled so quickly in a huge mass, and poured all their fury upon the devoted land.—He finally, Howeuer, riding his horse, discouraged himself from burning by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fetes, the night begins: and he had already advoncod away, the power of the storm was above — his thunders failed had barely an irilevai of re st — his thick heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall engulfed radiating his voric feet. Suddenly, his gaze was terrified, and he was carried with terrible speed through the wide forest. The animal finally stopped, through the tired, and found, by the brilliance of lightning, that it was in the rieigbbourhood of a hovel lhat barely rose from the masses of dead leaves and wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little more than one t0 guide towards the basn, or at the 1st is confident to get a shelter from the stork sting. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent mummcrit, prompted him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who was mingled with a choked and exulting mokerie of a laugh, continued in one unbroken aum0 sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, ignited the door of the hut. He himself got himself full jn dclrknesf: the s0und, however, the gujded. He was apparently unperceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and rio nolice was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he seized of themselves; when a man shook: \"Again bafsled!\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and feeling afflicted by orian who seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but jt was in vain: he was enumerated with his feet and shouted wilh enorm0us force ogainth the ground: — his enemy threw himself and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands on bis thr oats—when the brilliance of many torches penetrated through the hole that gave light in the hlm docly, disturbed; — he instantly grated, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mormer he crashed arms, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The slorm was still there; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soori heard by those who had everything. They entered, and the light of the torches fell upon the walls of mud, and the thatched loaded ori every injvidual straw with flaks of beaked soot. At Aubrey's decision, she was searched for who had attracted him to his cries; he was left agairi in darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his headess brought into a corse ljfeless. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw Thesamo Sorin again, when he locked them up, lying at his side. There was no colour on his check, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as endearing as the life that lived there:—push his neck and chest were blood, and on his cup were the marks of the teeth of the af having opened the vein:—to this men pointed, wept, at the same time struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the tbe side of her who had lalely boen for him the object of visions so bright and airy mary, now fallen with the flower of llfe who had died with her. He did not know what he was, his mind was inflamed and seemed to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a building parlicvIar, wblchhad found in the hut. Thcy was soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mothcr had missed. Their lame crjes, as they approached the city, announced the parents of somo terribly astrophe. \"That it would be impossible to describe this mourning; but when they were responsible for the death of the latter, they Iookod to Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey boing put to bed was seized of a violent mast fever, and wos often from Iirious; in these hc intervals would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Iclnthc — by an incompetent combinaton he seemed to be begging of his former componion to spare the being he loved. At other times, ho would permeate the mclledictions on his head, and curse him like a ber destroyer. Lord Ruthven, charismatic at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, the crowned hearing of the state of Aubrey, immodiately placed himself in the same house, arid becaine hjs constant accompanying. When the latter recovered fr0m his dolirium, he was horrified and amazed by the sight of him who had now combined his image with the ticlt of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost coding for the fault that had broken the separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to the presence of hjs. His lordship seemed quite hanged; it no longer seemed that the apathelio being wbo had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his recovery began to be repatriated, he gradually withdrew the same state of mind, and Av6roy perceived no difference with the former man, except that he was surprised to move his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exvulsion playing on his lips: he did not know wby, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the collapse of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to observe the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless sun;—he objected to wishing to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the mind that once distinguished him so much, now seemed to run away forever. Today, there was as much solitvdo and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished, the spirit bis could not find him in the nearby boed of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood next to hjf — if he sought him in the woods, his small step would appear moving in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violin; then suddenly turned around, showing, with wild imagination, his pale face on the wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, all of which created so bitter bones in his mind. He prophesied to Lord Rulhven, that he held his sons by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they could have visited these parts of Riothin Greece seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but if they hastened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They bearded many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of the os lhose that they defended pretoned dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than doferice. When they entered, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large massifs of rock descended from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for it was terrifyingly the wbole os tbe gone into the narrow neck, when they were surprised by the whistle of bolts near the head, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left tbem, and, p1acing themselves behind the rocks, bad started to turn in the directjon whenco the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turri sheltering defilement: but ashclmed to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shovts sade thom advances, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if none of the shouId thieves climb up and take them to the rear, lhey decided to 0 there to rush into scarf 0f the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shell of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the contest or his own peril, he was quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, thrown into his arms and submerged.\nBy the pr0mes of a great reward, Aubrey industrialized TBem soon to lead his friend freed to an eabin of lie-voices; and having agreed to a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are coritent simply to keep the entrance until their comrade has to come back with the sum promiscd, for whomb he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength grew rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to accelerate. His conduct and enthusiasm had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eyc was often attached to Aubrey, who was led to offer help with more seriousness than usual – \"Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I harass the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you deny my horror, the horror of your friend. \"-\"How? \"I need a little cabin, I can't explain the quire, but do you concacute me everything you know about me, my man was free of stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was unknown for a while in Erigland, me, but life. \"-\"We don't know what the hall is. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, who inflamed himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul, by all your fears of nature, swear thal, a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, who may come, or whatever you may see.\" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" Aubrey said, \"He sank laughing on his pillow, and he breathed no more.\"\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep;\nThose attending his aoquajntclnec with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath a cold camouflage on him, as is the presenliance of something horrible waiting for him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enlaid the hoof in which he had left the carp, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself and comrades, during his rot, to the top of a ncigbbourante mountain, according to a promise that tbey had given to his lord, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avbrey aftoned, and took several of the men, dissuaded from going and cooking it in the place where it was. But, which he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of the corpse or clothes, the robbers swore that they had swept the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he returned to 1east, convinced that thal had buried the corpse for the soke of the clolhes.\nWeary of a country in which he had mixed himself with such terrible misfortunes, and in which apparently aspired to raise this superstitious me1ancholia who had seized his mind, he resolved to reach it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, ar to Napies, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him, joining Lord Ruthven. Among other things, it was a case of several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and looking at curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently or named in the same style that was discovered in the fatal hut — he was shaking — which was intended to acquire a weapon, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that it was, in a way, equivalent to the shcath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be related to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; given the particular shape, the same variety of tintsvp0n the haft and moor were similar in the splendour on both, and did not leave space from afar; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, on his way home, in Rome, if the first investigations were about the lady Tbe whom he had tried to remove seductive arts from Lord Rvthven. Her parsons were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from the departmenturo of her seigneury. Avbrey's mind was the most shattered in so many horrors; he feared that this lady had lost a life in Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; he took care of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon bulwarked him on the shores of the Engllfh; and he hastened to the monsion of his satters, and Thero, for a rnoment, seemed to lose, jn the embraces and caresses of hls sjster, all mcmory of the past. If before, by her infernitine caresses, she had won her reward, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was still attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning graoe who won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no slight thal shine that normally exists in the heated atmosphorus of crowded apartment cl. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of missorturia, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indorulate a connoisseurous soul of a brigbter kingdom. His step was not that light base, which spoke me where 'sing a buttersly or a color mcly a ttract—he was sedated and pensive. When alone, her face was never moved by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed from her Hisaffiliary, and could have forgotten her presence those claws that she had kriew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes, which were then played in the light of their own native spbere. Yet she only eightoen, arid had not been presonated to the world, it was thought by his moro guardians that his preseritatjon should be delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was therefore now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be at the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would prefer that Bove stay in the rna tion of his fathers, and feed on melancholy wbich surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashion strangors, when his mind had seen 6 so torn up by the events he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into town, and prepared for the next day, which was atrocious as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing rooin had not been held for a long time, and a1l who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened this one. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the tbat memory the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this plccce, he felt himself suddained only by the arm, hanging a voice that he recognized too well, sovnded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that was bluffing him, when he was percised, at a little distance, the same character who had drawn the attention bis on the spot to his first entry into the int0 society. He almost took his weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and force a passage through the crowd, and threw himself in his car, and he returned home. And he passed over the room with the steps, and fastened his hands upon his head, for he feared that his thoughts might burst out of the hif brain. The Lord Ruthuen agairi will prevail — the circumstances began in the dreadfuI array — the dagger — his oats. — He woke up, did not believe he could — the dead laugh again! — He thought his imagination had contributed to the inage upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go again inta socioly; for though ho atternptod to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in getting the information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. By leaving her outside the protection of a motor, he traced a corner, and there he gave himself to his own devourer. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another bimbotin, saved his sistor surrounded by many, apparently in an energizing conversation; he began to pass by and approach the hor, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and in haste he forced her into the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and as he began to pass over, he heard this voice murmuring with him again: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but, pressing upon his sister, came to him.\nAubrey beoame alm0st dissidentod. If, before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now the certainty that the monster is again in a hurry over the hif thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was to Vclin that she instructed him to explain to him that her whclt had caused her sudden drive. He only read a few words, and thofe terrified him. The more he thought about the inority he had. His oath surprised him;—waf So he killed this monster so that he would wander, carrying ruin on his panties, arnidst everything he held dear, and not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he wanted to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He bought to use his own barrid t0 free the world from such misery; bulbeath, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; he locked himself in his room, did not flee, and did not eat until his sister Camo, who, with his eyes flowing with tears full of spirit, prevented him, for his own good, from supporting the natvre. Finally, he is no longer able to withstand the arid calm s0litudc, he leaves his house, gets bogged down in the street, anxious to steal the image that accompanied him. His dress was confused, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight humidity. He was n0 langer to be recognized; at first he came home with the evening; bvt al last, he laid bim to rest wherever the fat igue exceeded him. His sjster, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bim; but they were soon disappointed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea that he left by his abscence all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence was unconscious, he determined to enter into society as an agairi, and looked at him closely, anxious to farewell, despite his oath, all those whom Lord Ruthveri approached with imitation. Bvt whori entered a roar, his haggard and his loo ks suspicions were so intriguing, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that afflicted him so strangled. Wheri, however, the demonstration proved to be inavailable, the guards thought that the appropriate interpofe, and, pretending that the mind hjs was alienating themselves, they thought that it was high time t0 resume that trvst that had been imposed on them 6y Aubrey parents.\nDesirovs of salvatrice fr0m the wounds and sufferings that he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the genital eye these marks of what they considered madness, they engaged a physiciari to refide in the house, and constantly take care of him. Hehclrdly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became great, he was confined to his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had tied a g1assy chandelier; — the only sign of affection and memory left was played by himself in the writing of his sisler; then he would begin something, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were gravely distressed, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Ob, don't touch him, is your love for me great, don't come near the bim!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And once again he sank into a state, from which she could never wake him up. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies 6ecamc less freckled, and the mind hjs threw a part of its morosity, while bis guards observed, tumbling several times in the morning he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to chat with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Auhrey's situation being so terrible, wberi his sister went next day to get married. Immediately Aubrey drew attention; he asked w hom with anxiety. Happy with this rotating intellect mark, of what he feared to have been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't grab each other, but by sewing for a few minutes, if sister killed him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his lovely flow; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the idea of his brother's being wetting more alive on the feelings of afsection. He began to splash with all his warmth, and to congratulate Ber vpon on his marriage with a pcrson so dislinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprejse to behaldng the eatings of the monster who had had if lang influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus disinfected the rescmblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and gazirig on her with a frantic excrescence of countercris, he made swear that sbo would never marry this monster, so he— But he does not move forward, as if this voice agairi bye bim remembered his oath, suddenly turns into a ravnd, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near HLM but sees one n0. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had bearded the whole, and bought that it was only a return of his disorientation, entered, and forced her to leave him. He fell on his knees, implored, he instructed them to delay, but for one day. They, ostrating this to the madness they imagined having taken pos--\nHe tried to pacify him, retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the Tbo Lounge, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he understood that he was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hidden from tbose among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and by the claim of great affection for Brother Tbe arid interesl in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his powcr? His language had dangers and labors to tell: could it be expressed as an individual having no sympathy with any being on earth cr0wd, except with the one to whom he addressed himself;—could he say how, sinco he knew hor, his existence, hcld bcgun ta secm worthy of conservation, if it was inexhaustible that he could 1jst in his soothing accérits;—in the end, he knew so well how the use of the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his hr0ther,) which was lo to take placc tery day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, while left by the doctor and his guardians, hated the seruarits, but in vain. He whipped her with feathers and paper; she was given to her; he told his sister that he trusted her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own happiness, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arns as their hope and the hope of their house, the delay but for a few hours the tal marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, giving him to tho pbysician, he thought that it was better not to harass a dead Miss Aubrey's spirit by, what he considered, the ravines of a mania. The night spent ori withoutoul rest for the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be more easily conceived, the notes of occupied preparatian. Mornjng came, and the noise of the wagons br0ke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiously the servant of the last ovorcame of vigilance, they gradually evaded, leaving him in lhecustody of the old ari woman powerless. He drunk the occasion, with a single wos tied out of the room, arid in a moulinent found glossySi in the appclrtment where all carried almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached the sea, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the ocean, exclaiming with fury. When Lord Ruthuen murmured his ear on the stairs — \"Reminding your oath, and kriow, except for my fiancee on a day - to - day basis, Yovr Fister is disgraced. Women are fragile!\" Thus, hc pushed him to his landers, who, awakened by the old woman, had come into the sea of him. Aubrey could support himself longer; his nat history found the wind, had broken a hood-vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not begged to his sister, who was not there when he entered, as the physician feared to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride was marriedgro0m lcft London.\nAubrey'f's weakness has increased; the outpouring of blood-produced symptoms has occurred near the onset of declth. He was looking for the guards of his fissier could bc ca1led, and when midnight had struck, he resumed the hunt composed the convinced hcls reader, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but that they arrived was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, the arid sister of Abrey had been thirsty for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nTHE BYRON SIGNER RESIDENCE AGREEMENT, &c.\n\"The world stands before it, where to choose its place of rest, and Providence its guide.\"\nEN Sailing through the Greek archipelago, 0n b0ard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the ycar 1812, we pul inta tho port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. To the beauty of this place, and to the eertajn supply of catlle and vegetables aIways to be had there, to induce in any British ship t0 visit — both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums refund amply for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed, like usval, at boot0m bone the boy, and while the men were working in watering, and the bclrgaining handbag for cattle with the natives, clergy and mysels took a ramble at the Oove called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the br0w of Mount Ida (a small mound fo nomed) we met and hired a Greek vorig as our guide, who told us that he had come from Sclo with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot, did the Greek, and took me to a spiritual hive; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likoly to get married. He was a strange man, a very good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left the old ari man in the oharge of him: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins f0r it, (aboul L250 Cvrence English,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis story excited our cvriosity vory mucb, and we didn't waste time hastening into the house where our runryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old husband, who took us over the hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall1, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on each side, a large rnyrtle iri the cenlar, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, arid an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, using two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. Iri the living room we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large box of scams in the closet: it was open, bvt we did not think the justified ovrsels in the examination of the containers. On the painting of the recreation of Vollairc's, Sbakspeare's, B0ileau's, and Rousseau's complete works; the ruins of Einpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German 1anguclgc; Klopst0ck's Messiah; Kotzehue's noveIs; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Conslantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with notes of margol, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over them, and marked with slips of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old salda man: \"The lord had read books of tbesus in the evening before he splashed, and forgolent to put himself with the others; hut,\" he said, \"they must go back to it lle vntil bis; for it is so particvlar, that if I move a thing without anything, it would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a favor; I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except the zechins of twerity which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small oottage in the vagrant, and which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do kn0w for what they do.\"\nTbe operation of the outer house was pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen braads, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in the Greek architect,) were considerably higher than the roof. The rupee, surrounded by a light stono balustrade, was covered with a thin turkey carpet, under a strong awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, bone on them the Greeks pafs their fumigs by smoking, drinking Iight wines, such as \"lacbryma christi\", eating frujl, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left-hand hare, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens that assembled on its borders, under the shadow of two bvshes of largc bluertle, a marble seat with anornamcntal wooden waf placed, on what we had been told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I get angry,\" said the old man, \"praying\" because he was very fervent, \"and always tied up our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's eye v iew\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and nyrtle in bloom, and to the top of it, where an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stretchlm from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as glass, and a colourless horizon with a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a lilte on the left, through a viste of lofty chesn ut and palm trees, several islands of smaIt were observed in a distinct way, spreading the blue Iight waveo with spots of emerald green. I rarely had a sight more than she did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name except Domiriick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Thc Armerian,\" said our conductor, \"but I am not suro hc,\" and can't you tell me, old frierid?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not. We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details in the name of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nupal feast. He gave a cow to a man, borses to othors, and cotton and bacon to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to vs, of all that we called, t0 were a very eccentric and benevolent character. 0ne circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend at the cottage tangt own not t0 disclosc.

Deeply, we were not more curious in our research at the cottage, but we came together with the idea of re tuming at Mitylene or one day of running away; but at that day neevcr retvrn. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, arid in jvstjce in the gaod name of his seigneury, whieh a bceri grossly slandered.

Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all the actions of faith; and its drying up of the rest of solitude is an additional reasori to mark it as a being upon whose heart the Religion Halh sealed, ond ouer whose head Volunteer bath ber coat. No man can read the pleasant \" traits\" of pre-edition without boasting of being proud of him as a countrymcln.

    "26": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE supremacy on which this story is based is very general in tho Easl. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, it did not extend to Greek after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which timc, the idea being predominant, that a body of Laljn could not corrupt jf bried on their territory, it gradually unshake itself, and formed the subject of many stories of woriderfvl, still existing, of the dead rising from their grauces, and feigning on the blood of young people and beautusul. In the West, it spread, with variations of gold, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where belief exists, that the vampyres were damaging some of the blood of the vjctims, who mingled, lost their strength, and died quickly of consumpti 0ns; they wept the suckers of human blood, and their vcins became destabilized with such a slate of repletion, to cause blood to flow in all passages of their body, and even from very porous tbc of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious, and of course credible, account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreygo, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, ab ut fivo years earlier, a cortain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been horded to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a uampyre, but had found a way to rid him of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of Tobe Vompyre, rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, n0t prevented hiin srom from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his arid burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had seen deprived of life by his atlases. T0 prevent other malices, the inhabitants consulted Ir Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as is suppoved to ho usual in the ccls of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from corruption, and emit al lhe mulh,nosc, and ears, pure blood and florid. The evidence was thus obtained, they res0rtcd to the usual remedy. A pole was completely divorcing Arnold Poul's heart and body, where he was turned back from being so terribly scared as if he had been alive. That's what they did, they put his pearl, put his body, and dragged the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the c0rses of people who had died before the death of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents rising on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by a uampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it seems better suited to the object of tho presenl observations than any other invention that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it was considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime coincided when it existed, that the deceased not only mingled with vampyria, but forced to limit infernal visits to the only theosic beings he loved the highest of the earth, that he was bound by ties of kjndred and affection.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, Your Corsica will fraternize its tomb, then it will haunt the place of the district, and it will suck the blood of all your seed; from there your daughter, sisler, wife, During the night drain the flow of life; Yel will plunder the banquet that is to feed your livid corsus 1iving, Your victims, have yet come to an end, They will know the devil Sher beir sire; As you curse yourself, You will covet them, Your flowers are wilting in the stomach. But orie that for your fall of orime, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your tclsk and mark the last cloth of his cbeek: the spark of his eye, and the glazed look that freezes, is the lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, will tear the braids of his yellow bair, Os wbich, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — but riow is 6orne from you by the Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your grinning tooth and your sloppy lip; Tben tracking down to your sulten tomb, Go-clend with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these iri borror get away from the cursed specter than they do.\nSouthey presented a1so in his wild poem but 6eautiful of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having turned the grava fram in order to torment him, she loved better whllst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have reappeared from the sin of his life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenco. Tho veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of astonishjng sevoles cases of vampyrisrn, t0 that he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in bis great work on the fubject thys, in addition to a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional tales ilIustralive of the effects, put far some distortions learned, tending to provc it to be a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, clrid which now has no idea to be concuded by simply romarklng, that the word vampyre is that in the most general acoeptation, there are seueral other synonyms with it, made usc of in different parts of the world: like Vravcol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the stunning dissipations over a London winter, tbore appeared to the wretched parties of the leaders of the Tori a noble, moro remarkable for its singularities, that hjs rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention, which he could by a glance stifle lt, and throw Sear into the breasts where carelessness rciigned. They felt this senfation os awe, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead eye of moaning, which, staring on the face of the object, djd did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce tbrough inside the work of the ear; but fell on the cheek wilh a ray of lead that weighed on the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every dung; oll wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt weigbt os boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attonliori. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never won a war, elther of the blusb of the rnodosity, 0r of the strong emotion of passion, although her forrn and its contours were beautiful, many of the feole hunters tried to wjn her wait0ns, and to win, at leclst, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, clnd did everything except put in the robe of a mountainbank, to attract his attention:—but in vain:—when he stood up, though his eyes were apparently fixed on her, although he came out as if they were not hit;—even her unapplauseded impudene was flouted, and she left the field. But even if the common advltreff could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence witb whicb that he spoke to the virtuous woman about the innocent girl, that few knew that he never addressed women. Hc had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if he himself was tbclt exacerbating the fear of his singular character, or they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtue, as among those who vjces 6y thoir.\nAt about the same time, he was a young Gelleman by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of hail, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left the alfalfa to hissolf by guardians, who thought it was their responsibility simply to look after his fortune, while they took over the more importative charge of his sub-alterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high Romanic feeling of honovr arid cand0ur, which daily ruins so mony inilliners' appreritics. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vjcc was swallowed up by Providence simply by taking on the crevices of the infection of the scene, as we see in the aromas: to be thought that the misery of a house was content with coriander in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were bctter adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colorcd patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he was interested in gay environments, the married mothers surrounded him, trying to deseribor with the least lruth their languishing or grumpy favorites: the girls at the same time, by the brilliant faces wben he approaches, waved by the sparkling eyes tbeir, when we wipe his lips, foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his solitaires, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and the wax candles which figged, rioting fr0m the presenoo of a ghost, but in the absence of snvffing, thcre was not a foundry in real life for none of the thal congreries of pleasant photos and dcscriptio ns contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to return to his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of sleeping an idea of a man's stutter enlivened in himself, wbogave few other signs of his observation of external objects, tban dried him from tacil to their exifence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: to allow jng his imagination to picture something euery that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he quickly formed this object in the horo os a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person bent before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far he has endured his riot, that his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, the eclrnt said that Lord Ruthven's fairs were embarrassed, and so0n found, from a few notes of preparation in — Street, tbat it was on the point of travol. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for mary generalionf was considered necessary to allow young people to launder a few quick steps in the vico career towards getting equal with the old people, and not to let them appear as fallen from fkies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjections of pleasure or as praise, according to the degree of skill that one is wearing. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoked his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive fram him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of HLM, which, little by little, had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it glodically, arid in a few days they had passed tbe circling waters.\nHjtherto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's characler, and now we find him, that, although his actions more daredly were exploded from his point of view, the restlands offered different conclusions of the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enovgb to relieve their immediate wankers. But Aubrey n0t avoids pointing out, that he was riat on the vrtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes even attend on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask fomething, not to relieve hls wants, but to grant him to wallow himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charlty. It was, arbitrated, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the indigent vjrtuaus. Tbere was a circumstance that escaped the charity of his Lordsbip, who was more impressed by his spirit: all the vpons that he was granted, inevidently found that there was a curse on him, for they were all led lo tho scafsold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities, he passed, Avbrey wcls surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the censors of all the fashjonable uice; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: hc bet, and always played with the eagerness, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and he lost even more than he won; but it was still the same immutable sace, with which hc gazed the saciété around: it was not, however, when the young fuI novice eruption was encouraged, or lhc father without chance of a great family; then his wisb seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of mirid was set aside, and if the eyes storklled with more fire than lhat of the cat while deliring with the mouse ha1f-mort. In each basn, he raises the youth formerly trifle, torn from the circle which he has adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; wbilst much a father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his late immense wellth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yot he does not look at the money of the table of play; but immediately the last, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he has just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bul being the result of a degree of certainty of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the cvning os lhe more experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his bif friend, and begged HLM to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; — but he delayed him— for the day of the cacb, he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly; however, it happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, arid in the midst of the various wild scenes and ricb of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of jt than the confidant oxeitement of vajnly wisbing to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began the appearance of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a timo losl vision of his companion; he left him waiting daily on the morning circle of an Illian countess, where he went jn searoh from the memories of another cily almost deserted. While he was committing himself in this way, the letters dreaded from England, which he opened impatiently; the first was fr0m his sister, breathing nothing but the afsection; the others were of his guordiclns, the latter surprised him; if she had already entered irito his imagiratjon that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to waste him reason sufsicjent sar belief. His guards insisted that his friend, and urgcd, immediately leave his character, be terribly uicjous, so that the position of irresistible power of seduction, makes his licentious habits more dangerous to silk. It had been discovered that the contempt for adultery had not been caused by a halorous character of Hcr; but this bo had required, for his gratification, that his victim, the father of his guilt, be hvr1d of the pinacle af unwelded virtue, at the rise of the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females whom he sought, apparent because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even lhrown the mask set aside, and had not scrambled to expose the difference of this kind of thing to the pvblic goose.\nAubrey torpedoed vpon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which the eye roams. He tried again to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, by seeking, in the sense, to touch him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same ircle, and saon understood, that his Lardship was trying to train the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose house he had mostly frequented. In Italy, it was rarely that a single woman was met with society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Avbrey's eye followed in all its windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been matched, which would probably end in the ruin of a harmless girl, albeit without thought. Not wasting time, being in Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly1y asked him for his intentions with regard to the Icldy, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were blurred, as he believed, and that he was content to laugh when asked if we wanted to marry him. Aubrey replied; he attached himself, immediately writing a note, to say that from that moment on he must refuse to accompany his Lordship iri the rest of their extended visit, to be odorod his servant to seek other opartments, and calling the mother of the lady, informed him of the hell that he knew, rioting only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the caracter of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day, Lord Rvthven contented himself with his servant's notification of his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suggest that there was no suspicion of his plans being violated by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his stopovers to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimself by tracing the erased records of the ancient glory upan monuments which, apparently, had hidden under the veil of shelter or many colored lichens, as if it were a matter of rubbing the acts of free men only before the slaves. Urider tbe same roof as Helf, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could hue for ined the m0del for a pajnler wisbing to pavrtray on canvases the promised hope of faithful lbc in the paradise of Mah0met, except that her eyes go too much rind for any orian to thrnk that she could belong to those wbo had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle and poor type of her beclu-\nFor whom would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of an anjmy nature, for this sleepy look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an eplcuro. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, often attaching to the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of her farm, floating as jt were on the wind, looking at herself greedy, who forgot the otters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased lahlet, in contemplation of his figurc sylph. Often, her braids would fall, as she flirted around, exhibiting in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly erased from the hues, he might well excuse the forgnitude of the antiquarian, who let escape fram her mirid the objoct even that he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why describe the charms that everyone feels, but no cari appreciates?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing sounds and stifling balloons. As he drew the remains which he mocked to protect a memorial for his suture hours, she stood by, on the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the bones of his place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance on the open peain, extended to him, in the brilliant collars of the youthful memory, the marriage pump which she remembered to have looked at in his infarction; and then, turning to subjects which had been evident1 made a great impression on his mind, told him all the penal stuff of his nurse. Her sincerity is attached to what she tells, excites the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampyre, wbo had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the bewitching morigues, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at the sucbois and harpy fclritases; but Ianthe quoted to her the nclmes of old men, who had at last detected a living between them, after the seueral of their relatives relatjves and childreri had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend'f appctite; and when she found such unbelievable, she begged him to believe her, for he had been noticed, that those who had doubted to question their existence, had always had some pro0f He forced them, with sorrow and tears, to confide what was true. She detailed to him the trophic operation of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, haunting a rather precise description of Lord Rulhven; however, he persisted in persuading her, that he could not truth in his fears, at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in supernatural power 0f Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Iarithe; his innocence, so controduced with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought hif visi0n of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young mcln of Eng1ish habits, marrying a uried Greek girl, still he was more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form that he preceded. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for the same antiquarian search, he did so, delermining not to return uritll his object wos reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attcntion up the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept an image quisoedod alone the arrogant possessor of thoughts. Ionthc was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always fled from him with reluctance; but it was the bccluse sbe no longer had anyone with whom the sbe could visjt hor fav0urite haunted, while his gvardian was occupied in sketoohing or vncoveringsome fragment that had escaped tbe destructivc hand of time again. She wrongly appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and the two, with Severcll's prosent, affirmed their exltence, pale with horror to the riam itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey seized one of the exhortations that had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they immediately begged him not to turn at night, for he had to go through a wood, that no Grcek would ever be rcmain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration. They dethroned it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of the representations, and trjed to laugh them outside 0f the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring lhus to mock a fuperior, infernaI power, whose very narne apparently made their hl0od freeze, he was his own.\nNcxt morning Aubrey put osf on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obfer the melancholy face of his host, and worried lofind lhclt his words, mocking the bolief of these horrible siends, had inspired TBem with such terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and begged eminently to return, and the night was diminished the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. It was, however, so busy in its reseorch, that ho did not perceive that the daylight would end so, and that on the horizon there, with one of those spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gather a huge mass of irito, and pour all the fury upon the devoted land.—He finally, bowlevcr, mounted his horse, dtormined to compensate by the speed of his delay: but it was too late. In the so southern climates, js almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the njgbt begins: and there had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders of ecbolrig had little of an lnterval of resl—jts heavy groove forced they way through the canoeing falching, while the forchu blue Iightring seemed to fall and radiate to its very effect. Suddenly his horse looks scared, and be carried with terrible speed in the entangled forest. The anima1 finally stopped by the fatjgue, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a coffin that rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Demonstrating, he appropriated himself to sin some oria to guide him to the city, or at least relying on helpcrs from the storm's eruption. As they approached, the thundcrs, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a waman mixing himself with the suffocated laughter, exulting a laughter, continued in an almost intact sound;—he was surprised: hut, agitated by the thunder, which rolled on his heel, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. So in total darkness: the smile, however, guided hirn. He was apparently unporced; for, although he called, the sounds were still sounded, and nothing was taken from him. Ho found himself with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out, \"Agairi turned!\" And he felt himself assailed by an ane whose strength seemed superhuman: wet to sell his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; he fought in vain; he rose up from his feet, and cast strength against the ground; his enemy cast him upon him, and burned himself on his chest; he had put his hands on his thraat; and when he dazzled with many torches that entered into the hole that gave the light of the day, he disturbed bjm; he rose up instantly, and left the prey bis, he rushed through the door, and sat down in a momcnt the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, and was no longer heard. The storm was now stjll; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by these wjthout. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble straw spread over each straw with a heavy soot flake. To Aubrey's desire, she was sought who attracted him by his cries; he was again left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torohes once m0ro burst upwards0n, t0 perceive the aerial form of his condvctress fauler brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, h0ping thclt he wos but an arisirig vision of his disturbed imagination; bvt he a gain seen the form of sclme, that he uncloses them, stretched by his side. There was no colaur on his cheek, not even on his lip; however, there was a silence enveloping his face that seemed as attached as the Ijfe who used to live there: — on his neck and chest wos blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth that had bloodshed the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, struck at the same time wilh h0rror, \"In Vampyre! A Vompyre!\" A littor was quickly formed, the clnd Aubrey was placed next to her who had been for him the object of so much brigbt and fairies vjsions, now fallen with the os lisée de fleur which badly died in her. He did not know what his purchases were, his mind was snoring and seemed to flout the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in the hand hjs a bare dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the cabin. Tbey was soon met by different parties wbo had been engaged in the soarch 0f his wbom a malhcr had missed. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, announced the parerities of the same terrible catastropho. \"It would be impossible to endure grief; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. Thcy was unconscionable; both died in the heart of br0ken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent m0stcver, and was often delirlous; in intervals he wovld called Lord Ruthven arid on Iantho — by an incompetent combiration he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being that he had l0ved. To others, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed the hjm as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from wbatever m0tive, hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant companion. When he returned from his delirium, he was horrified by the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, by his kind words, almost pleaded repentance for the fawn that had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls seigneurie vuined completely changed; it seemed only the apathetic being that bad so astonished Aubrey; but also s0on that his convalescence began to be fast, he ogain gradually withdraws irito the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey perceived rio difference of the former man, except that other times he was taken to meet his gaze fixed jntently on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted hjrn. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook in an apprehensive manner to observe the waves without tides and the coolirig breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, circllng, llke our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to strive to avoid the eyos of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrcy, by this shock, was much weakened, and thal elasticjty of mind that had once s0 distinguished him riow seemed to have luge forever. Today he was as fond of loneliness and silerie as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his spirit could not plunge him into the vicinity of Athens; if he sought to engulf him in the ruins which he had once frequented, Iantbe's shape stood by his side — if he fought him in the woods, his light step would become bogged down in the middle of Tbe vnderwood, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly he turned, to his imagination, his palo fao and his wounded throat, with o meek smiIe Upan his lips. He decided to steal scenes, every whicb seam created bitter ass0ciations in his mind. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by his tender care, that he had takon of him during his illness, that they were filling the parts of Greece, and that he had not seen. They traveled in each direction, and looked for all the places where a recolleotiori could be ottachcd; but although they hastened so fr0m place to place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which, according to the theories, were only the invention of individuals, who were interested in the generosity of those whom they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of tbus neglect the advjce of the inhibitors, they traveled once with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than delayed. Upon entering, bow, a narrow defilement, set the beat of whicb was the bcd of a torrent, with great masses of rocks brings down the neighbouring precipices, they bad rcasson to repent of their neglect; for there was not all the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistilig of the closed bullets at their head, and by the report echo of Severai rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind rocks, hcld began to shoot in the djrection wbcnce the game came. Lard Ruthven and Au6rey, imitating their oxample, withdrew for a moment 6are protected from defilement: but shameful of being shot down by a fae, who, with insulting cries, shouted at them, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, all the thieves should climb up and take them to the back, they immediately decided to rush in search of the eriemy. Hardly had they lost the shclter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received the shot cl in the shovlder, which brandished hjm lo tbe gr0und. Aubrey besieged himself to his donkey; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him – his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately thrown vp their arms and surrendered.\nWith promises of a great reward, Aubroy soon jnducha opened his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no more troubled by their presence, being simply told to keep the entrance until their eoinrade returned with the sum promlsed, for which he had the order. Lord Ruthven's strength was rapidly reduced; in two days death was inflamed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct had not changed his appearance; he seemed as insensitive to the pain that he had been obiects about him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became obvious1y uncomfortable, and his eye fixed to Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with the usual serious moro thari – \"Sit me! Yov inay save me—you can do more than that—I don't mean my life, I listened to the death of existence iny as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, yavr fr iend honor. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need a little lilt, my life flourishes, I can't explain everything, but if you hide everything you hide, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been known for some time in England, me, but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up with exulsive violence, \"Swear by all your soul that, by your nature, you swear that for a year you will not give your know-how of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whether it occurs or what you will see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he ridiculed himself on his pillow, and he did not burn any more.\nAubrey rested, but fell asleep in the riot; the many circumstances which accused him of knowing this man rose up on his mjnd, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oalh, an earthquake came upon him, as if from the presentation something horrific were waiting for him. He got up early in the morning, he talked about eriting him the hovel in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and eomrades, at his retreat, to the pinccle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise he had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray fjrst of the moori who lifted his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took several of the men, determined to bury him on the place where he was. But when he laughed at him, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the robbers swore that the identity1 stone on which they had laid the body. For a long time, his mind was perplexed in his conjectures, but he finally came back, eonv asked that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of an oountry iri which he had encountered in the mind of such calamities earth, ond where all apparently conspired to raise superftilious tbat mlancholy who had settled on his mind, he resolved to leave you, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Olranto, or to Naplcs, he occupied him with the organization of these esfests which he kissed with him, which extended to Lord Rutbven. Among other things, there was an ease of containing severol crime wapaons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Wbilft turning them, and looking at their curious f0rms, what was his surprise to find a sheath apparently decorated in the same bone style the dagger discovered in the hut of fata1—he shuddered-hasteri to gajn more proof, to be found the weapon, and his terminal can he imagine when he discovered that he did, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for further certainty: they sowed their eyes to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the parlicular form, the same varying shades on the haft and fheath were similar in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; here were the alfo drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and when he returned to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had tried to practice in the seductive arts of Lord Ruthuen. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and it has not been heard since the break of the seigneury bis. Aubrey's mind became almost brokered vnder so many repeated horrors; it was conjured that the lady tbis had fallen a victim to the desert royyer af Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupant was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the ghost's life that he held dear. He came to Calais; o break, which began to obey his will, soon set him on the shores of the Eng1ish; and he hastened to his father's house, and there, for a while, began to lose, in the emhraccs and caresses of his sister, oll memory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had spoiled her affection, now that the Bogan Wombln appeared, she was still attached as a c0mpanion.\nMiss Avbrey didn't have that grinning grace that won the gauze and applause from the salon assemblies. There was no such brilliant lighl that exists only the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the softness of the mind below. Therc was a melancholy charism about this which n0t seemed to come from the misfortune, bvt from a certain foal inside, which seemed to indicate a soul capable of a brighter reolm. His step was not only the light foot, wbich wandering where to er a butterfly or a color can attract—it was sedate ond pensivo. When Alono, her face was devoured by the smile of joy; but when Berfrère breathed her affection, and in her presence inflamed her sorrows which she knew destroyed rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of voluptuous tho? It seemed that these eyes — this face was then p1aying in the ljght of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and she had not been brought to the world, for you had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation had to be diverted until her brother's return from the infectious, that he could be her protector. It is now, in this case, a place where the next living room, which was approaching quickly, was to be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the fathers' house, and fed on the melancholy that invaded him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; bul he decided to sacrifice his own consolation to the protection of sister bis. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe storm was excessive — a drawer-room had not been held so long, and all those who were anxious lo bosk iri the kingly smile, hastened the thithor. Aubrey was there with her sister. Standing in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, he committed himself to the memory of the first lime he had seen in Lord Ruthven's place, and suddenly felt seized by his arm, and a voice herccognized too well, sounded in his ear, \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn around, eager to see the spectrum that would explode bim, when he perceived, a little distance, the same sigvre that drew his attention to this place when he entered the silky Sirft. He looked at his limbs almost refusedirig to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and bewitching a passage through the crowd, he threw light into his car, which was set in motion at home. He grabbed space as he rushed, and fixed his hands on his hecld, as if he feared that his thoughts would faint from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him — the ecumerances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up himself, he could not believe it possible — death went up! — He thought his imagination had corijtured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, over there-\nTo return to the priesthood, for he hastened afk about Lord Ruthven, the name hurig on his lips, and he did not seize the information. He wrote a few nights later with his sister at the convention of a noar relationship. Leavirig she under the protection of a matron, he rotted in a recreation, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, many were Ieavlng, he woke up, and entering another room, found sister bis surrounded by severa1, apparently in a deserved conversation; he tried to pass and get her neclr, when one, wbom he asked to move, tvrned around, and revealed to him those characteristics that he has the most horror. He pushed her to the street; at the door, he found her flocked by the crowd of fogs waiting for their lords; and he undertook to bend them, again with the beard, the voice whispered near him — \"Remove your oath!\" — He dared not turn around, but, pressed his locksmith, he quickly reached Hame.\nAubrey became distracted alinoste. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely was he engrated, now that the monster's certainty has once again pressed on the hif thoughts. Her slster's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated him to explain to him what had led to her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who roasted it. The more he bought, the more perplexed he was the mare. His oclth surprised him;—was he there to let this monster wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, ainidst all that he held dear, and n0t avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But if he were your braclk his oath, and dlsclosing his svspici0ns, what would force him? He thought he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister oame, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for the sake of the sakc er, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear stil1ness and loneliness, he left his dung, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal this irritating which disturbed him. His becclme dress neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; at the fjrst he returned to the house, and at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who was fleeing a fast pursuer than any other thought-froin. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Sluck with the idea that he left behind by bis absence of all his friends, with a fiende omon gst, whose prefence they were unconscious 0us, he decided to enter society again, and court him closely, anxious versantly, despite the oath bis, all that Lord Ruthven tamed with intimacy. But when he entered the room of the lnto, his distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner wilts so visible, that his sister lost herself to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that strongly engulfed him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought to interfere and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, thought that it was high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them by the porents of Aubrey.\nDesirous of erasing hlm of wounds and sufferings being had daily metod iri his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered madness, lhey engaged a doctor lo resident in the hovse, and constantly taking care of him. He did not like to notice him, his complete was his mind absorbed by ono terrible subjoct. His inconsistency was so great that he was confined to his cbambre. There, he often lied for dayf, unable to be woken. He had been moved, his eyes had reached a glasfric chandelier; — the only sign of affection and re-collection that remained appeared above his sister's training; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that afflicted him, he would dissipate her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" Wheri, however, asked whom he referred to, his only answer was: \"True! True!\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and bis rennided part of its gl0om, while its guardian observed, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of her guardians entering the room, began lo conuerse with bis physiclan on tbc melancboly eircumstance os Beirig d'Aubrey in such a horrible situation, when her sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this intelIeot return mark, if they feared that he would be private, they instigated the Marsderi Earl's namo. He was a young count whom he had met in socly, Avhrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expressirig his intention the presence of the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, Hjs' sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smilo; for he pressed his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the idea that his bra was once rnore aliue to his feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to corigratulate it on the ber marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and the accompllsbmenl evcry; when to be suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, which was his surprise to 6chondirig the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his ljse. He grabs the p0trtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under his feet. On his hiin ringing why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husbclnd, he looked as if he did not understand it — then capturing her groups, and looking at her with a frantic explossion 0f counting, he badc ber swearing that she would never marry that snoring, for he—but he could not hold on—it seemed that if this uojce repeated to him remember his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was a return of his disorder, enter...\nAnd Miss Aubrey's forceful, wanted his ta leavo. Hc sells them on his knees, he pleads, begs them to delay them, but for one day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined having taken possession of his spirit, cndeav0ur to pocify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthveri had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. Wherihe heard of Aubrey's ill health, he easily vnderst himself to be the cause; but when he let go that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be realized from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened in advance of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great effect for the brother and interest in the bis destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his powor? His language had dangers and labors to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, unless he could hear it to whom he addressedSi;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if he were only thal that he would listen to the soothing accents;—in the end, he kncw so wcll how the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The Tbc title of the older branch fell to him in length, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excufe to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for eontinent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardian, tried to bribe the servarits, but in voicing. He asked for pen and paper; it was the givcn; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated the happiness, her honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who have welded their arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to sleep, but for a sewn hour this marriage, on whieh he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would dilute it; but, giving it to the doctor, he bet it that not harassing Miss Aubrey's miride any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that mcly inore easily be conceived as described, the notes of occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the noise of the locks broke a bis eor. Aubroy grew up in a frantic almast. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame lheir vigilancc, gradually moving away, leaving hjm in the custody of the powerless old woman. He besieged himself to the opporunity, with a tied was out of the room, arid in a m0ment was found in the apart tbe where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri sees him first: he approaches immediately, and, takjng his arm by force, precipitates him from the room, sorrow without voice. Wben on the stairs, Lord Ruthven wbispered iri his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée day by day, your sist er is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" He pushed him to his coaches, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in the service of him. Aubrey covld rio more to support himIf his rage did not slndjng wind, had broken a vase of blood, and he was transported to bed. It was not mentioned his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the pbyslcian was afrclide to stir it. The wedding wos soleinnized, and tho married and married left Lond0n.\nAuhrey's weakness increased; blood effvsion produced thc symloms near the teeth. He wanted the guards of his sisler mig ht to be called, and when the hour of the night struck, he described in a composite way what the reader persisted — he died immediately clfter.\nThe guar dians bastenod lo prolect Miss Aubrey; hut when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disapproved, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose hif place 0f rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nOn board one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put in the port of Mitylenc, on the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found there, iridulate many Brilish ships to visit it, both the men of war and the merchants; and rather shake him off the path for the sbips linked to Smyma, his obsessions to repay for the deviation of a vayago. We disembarked; as a vsual, at the bottom of the bay, arid while the men were working on watering, and the handbag trading for cattle with the shipwrecked, lho clorgyman and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, arid other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small nominated mound) we met and cngaged a young Greek like our guidance, who told us that he had come from Scio wilh an English lord, who left the jsland fovr days before at ovarrival in his felucca. \"He hired me like a pllol,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am like one to marry. He was weird, but a very good man. The house on the hill of Tbe, facing the river, belongs to him, and he lows left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English Urcncy,) and low resided there about four months, though not constantly; for he slashes his felucca very osten to the various islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we did not waste any time hastening the house where our compatriot had resided. We were graciously received by an old man, who led uf on tho mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, a training room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green valleys, marble tabs on either side, a myrtle largo in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branohes by mouirig a fjxed source in the side of a small br0nze Venus in a learilng posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the fur. In the lobby, half a dozen engineers...\ncane chairs ljsb, and an empty library: there were no mjrrors, nor a silvicultural painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two dry plush duvets a plough — the c0mmon bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we obferred a marble niche, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large chest of Seanan in the fence: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the contents of lhc. On the tablet, the corners of Voltaire, Shclk Speare, Boileclu and Rousseau are finished; the Rvins of Einpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the messjah of KIopftoek; the Kotzebue riovels; the game of the Robbers of Schiller; Paradjse Lost of Millon, an Italian edition, prejnted in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constanlinople, much torri, but no English book of any descripsion. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and latiri. The Messiclh was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked wjth sheets of paper, on which olso were remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had been read and read these books before sailing, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, it is necessary to lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I were to move something without order, he would frown me for a hesitation together; it is very good elsewhere. I did him a favor one day, and I find it very difficult to take care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who is redone in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought from Adrianople; I do not know why.\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars fluted with black p1inths and fret work cornices (as it is now eustomary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher roof of lhari. The roof, overwhelmed by a balustrclde of light moons, was seperated by a thin, boned turkey carpet with a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, svch as \"lachryma chrjsli\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little strcamlet glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evening and nhts ljll twelve hours, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, prayjng, \"for he was very fervent, and always attended the church of the ovr twicc for a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A 0f line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, surrounded by olive trees and myrties in 6loom, and ori the suinmjl whose ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea beats in glass, and on horiz0n not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, small islands severaI were distinctly observed, spreading the blue waveIight with fpots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his man, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"has known you, but I am sure there will be riots,\" and can't you say, oid friend? \"If I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We did not have the time of Uisit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city we learned severa1 particularf 0f the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was the last one on top of the island, and even danced with them at the rival party. He gave a cow to a mon, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, arid he gave Groek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed vs, of all that we understood, lo was a very occentric loving ordinal character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage thought not to reveal. Hc had the most beautiful donut, with which the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and had taught him the use of hjmsolf.\nThis was the irformation with wbich that we left from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all or the rack, guessing wbo that rowing to Grcece could him. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Follirig in the company of Mr FOSTER, the clrchitecl, a student of WYATT'S, who had been trclvelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I struck him in my journeys or the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of his l0rdship, as we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harolde\" being put in the hands of ovr recryized thc recluse of Calcla iri every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious in our cattery research, but we have been consoIed nosfeIves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a futuro day; bvt to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court if the good name of Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dismayed as an inconsiderate disposition, opposed to the association with human nature, or contributing arduously to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be collected from such small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so gloriously depied in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tonderries, sympathies, and charity oppear to guide all his actions; and he courtes the rest of solitudes clri additional reason to mark him as a being on whose heart religion sealed his, and on whose head Benevolenco halh threw his coat. Noman cari has read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received ccllutely, especially when they are directed against the morals of man; and whoever dares to justify his words is a court where everything must appear, olone mcly censors the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the wor1d, is the surest testimony of virtuous beauty and self-approval consciousness.\nTHE END\nGiIlet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-Street.",
    "27": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy J0hn Wil1iam Polid0ri\nTHE superimposition on this tale is very general to the East. Amorig tbe Arabians opposes being a comman: it does, however, extend to the Greeks only after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed their present form only since the division of the Latin churches and groeks; to which limousine, the dominant idea becomirig, that a Latin body could not be extinguished if it was buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many stories astonished, externally, from the dead rising from the tombs of thcir, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austricl, and Lor rajno, where belief exclaimed, the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims, which bocam emclciatod, perstbeir strenglh, and quickly dictated consumption; while these human wood suckers were weakening — and their veins bocamed to such a state of reconstitution, as to cause the blood of al the posames of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, March 0f, 1732, is a curial, and, of the bear, crcdiblereport of a particular casc os vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they asserted p0sitively and unwaveringly, that about five years earlier, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the border of the Servia Tu rkish, he had the hecn tormented by a vampyr, but had four times a way to get rid of evil, eliminating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyc, and rubbing hese1f with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from pretending to be a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and 6vrian, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been devoured from life by his attacks. To sow even more harm, the inhablantf having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrifm) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pvre and fIoride blood. The evidence thus obtained beeri, they resorted to the remedy accvstome. A stclke was driven entirely into the heart and the body of A Arnold Paul, where it is reported to Havo also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The sarnois measures were adopted with the corses of these Persians who had died before of vclmpyrism, for fear that they would become, in tvir tvrn, agents of others who had been able to control the\nI lived them.\nThe uriversal belief is, that a person pursued by a vampyre becomes a uampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief 6 usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is relativated here, because it adapts better to the current situation than any otber instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a heinous crime was committed while it existed, tal the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrif, but forced to consect his infernal victuations only to those beings that ho loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes to the expression \"Gi aour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent it, Your c0rese shall be torn from his tomb; Tben shall flout ghastly tho nalive plac e, And suck the blood of every race Ly; There of your daughter, sister, wlfe, Towards midnight drains the current of life; And yet hate the banquet which must feed your livid living corsus, Your uictims, Ero they expire, They shall know the devil for their sire; As cursed theo, Thou cursed the hem, Thy flows are inlaid upon the stem. But ono that for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a fat one — Thclt word will wrap your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the timidity of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last muselle view of a glassy look that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when one wore the tenderest plodge of affection — but n0w is neo-neo far from you Memorial of your agony! But with your own bestblood drop; your grinning tooth, and the hook's blade; Thcn harassing your sullen bove, Ga—and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the spectre tighter than they.\nMr. Southey also presented in his wl1d but beautiful poem of \"Thaloba\", the corso vampyre of the good Arab Oneiza, who was represented as having returned from the grava in order to torment him She loved better when she was in existence. But this cannot be assumed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, sbe being rottrayod blurs the wbol of history as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tho veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his travels of several cases of asl0nishlng of vampyism, so that he claims to have an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, clnd traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forward some learned dissertators, tending to prove that he is a classic, like woll af bar6arian error.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simply rcmclrking, that although the term Vampyre is that in most Gerrieral acceptances, there are several other synonyms of lt, makes use in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, the small parties of the leaders appeared in the name of a noble rnan, more remarkable for its singularities, honoring its rank. Hc looked at the mirror around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the lighl laugh of the fair only attracted his attention, but hc mighl by a calm glance, and threw fear into those fucking tits carefree reigned. Those who felt this sensitivity of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the object of lho, did not seem penotral, and at a glance pierced through the inner works of the heart tho; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead weighed on the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every houso; all fought to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the exciment of beeri, and now felt the weight of boredom, were plecclised to have something in the presence of the Ihair capable of engaging their attraction. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many women mocked him after his notoriety to gain his attentions, and won, at least, some mclrks of what they might call affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of the aurora monster erected in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw hersels on her way, and made all the cabin put on the dress 0f a Montagnard bank, to draw her attention:—but in the vairi:—when she stood safe from him, her eyes were apparently fixed on her, although jf tbey were vnperceived;—even her unapplied impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But common adultery could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the fcmal sex was indifferent to him; but such was the apparent water with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to fomals. However, he had the reputation of a winning language; and whoever he was, he even overcame the drift of the Sirigular character, or thal tbey were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among those women who make up the thc boast of their sex of their domctic virtues, as among those who sully it by their viccs.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to Landon: he was a 0rphen left with a single sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was a teenager. The guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, as they demanded the most important burden of his mind for the attention of the smoking mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more flouting his judgment. He had, hencc, this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so inany millners' apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that uice was tbrown iri by Providence simply for the picturesque flaw of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the dowry of cl0thes, wbich were also hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various combed patches. He thought, in sinus, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was the hands ome, frank, and rich: for these reas0ns, at his entrance into the gay houses, many m0thers surrounded him, trying when should describe with the least lrvth their liking or blushing favorites: the girls at the same time, hy their brigbtenlng faces when ho appr0ached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he quickly led to false riots of his laents and his merit. Attached as he was to love in his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, exept in the tallow and candles of wax that sparkles, not from the presence of the tbe of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in the real life for Ari of these congres of pleasant photographs arid descripions contained in thoso voluines, srom that he had formed his study. Findirig, however, some compensation in the Gratified vonity hjs, he was abject to requisition his dreams,wherei the extraordinary though we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked back; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few olfactory signs of hif ohfcrvation of external objects, which lbetacit enslaved to the existence of tbeir, imputed by tbe av0idanoe of their eontact: allowing his imagination to imagine all that has his propensity t0 extrvaginant ideas, he soon formed this object to the hero of a r0mance, ond decided to observe the offspririg of his fantasy, rather than the pcrson hesore him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far, has started on his opinion, the presence lhat bis has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rutbven's fairs were embarrassed, and he found soy, from the notes of preparation in — Street, thal he was about to travel. Desiring to spoil a certain insormation with regard to this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he hjnté to his guardians, that it was time for him to execute the tovr, which for many generations has thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards getting equal with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if they were falling from heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, in accordance with the degree of competence offered to them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoked his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to renew a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem fram hjm, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circular wotters.\nHilhert0, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Rvthven's character, and now he found, that although much more of his actors were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; — the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to jndigence by the altergent misfortunes even on virtue, that he bcstoed his alms; — they were serious of the door that sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to osk s0mething, rioting to relieve his desires, bul to allow hiin to harden himself in his Iusl, or to sink hlm still docher in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater transmission of the vicious, which judiciously prevails over the weakness of retjrlrig of the virtuous needy. There, a circumstance abdicated charity towards her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mlnd: all those upori that it was granted, inevitclbly found that thore was a curse on her, because tbey were either lcd at scaffolding, 0r sunk at the lowest and m0st abiect misery. In Brussels and others through which they passed, Aubrey was savoured to the apparent eagerness to whip his companion sought out the certres of alI vice in fashion; he put himself in all the spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always played the success wilh, exoept where the best known was his antagonist, and then ho lofl even more than he won; but he was still with the same ruthless face, with which he generally looked at the society tbe around: he was not, however, if when he encountered the eruption young novelce, or tbe father without chance to a great family; then his vory wlsh seemed to be the law of fortune — his apparent abscracy of ind was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than the thal de tbe cat while delirling with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he lifts up the young influent in form, torn from the circle of TB, cursed, in the solitude of a dvngeon, the fate that had attracted him withiri the reach of this fiend; while much a father sat frantic, in the middle of the aspect speaking of mute hungry children, wilted a slngle stuffing of his wealth to immerse late, or with even buying enough to satisfy the most fervent present. Yet he took rio of money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner af many, tbe last golder he had just pulled himself out in the convulsive catch of the innocent: this mlgbt but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, hawen, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Avbrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to stop this charity and pleasure which caused the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed it—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speculate openly and openly at hlm; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and I am the various wild and rich soenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and although Aubrey was neclr the ohiect of his civriofity, he did not dare more gratification of him than the conslanting excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystcry, which the cxal imagination began to assume the appearance of something supercltural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost the sight of his companion; he left him every day on the snoring circle of an Italian woman, while ho went in search of the almost deserted afanother city memorials. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience cager; the first was draining his sister, breathing the nathirig but affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had previously penetrated into the jmagariation that there was an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give bim vain reason to belief. His guardians insisted that he gradually seize his fried, and exhorted, tbat his character was terribly vicious, for lhal the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made the bi-licenliouf habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that bis coritempt for adultery had not originated in the hatred of his character; but tbat he had reqvired, in order to strengthen his gratification, tbat hisvictim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown fr0m the pinacle of the insullicd uirtue, until the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, tal all the females whom apparently 0n account of their virtue had, from his sorvrc, thrown into the mask, and n0t scrupulously to expose the whoo disormly of tbeir vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on wbich lo rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, in order, in this sense, to monitor him more closely, and to let the light circumstances pass without realizing it. He entered the same ircle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of which he was mainly sequenced. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; so he was forced to wear his folds in secret; but Aubrey's eye plowed him in all his windings, and soon decreed that an assignment had 6th apoirity, which would probably end in the ruin of an irinocent girl, though insensitive. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to have his summer night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he was supposed to have everything on suoh an opportunity; and after having been rushed if he intended to marry him, simply confused. Au6rey retired; and immediately, writing a note, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to search for olher apartments, and invoked the mathcr of Iady, informed hor of all that he knew, born only with regard to his donut, but also with regard to the chacrater of his Lordship. The assignatjon was ready. The next day Lord Rvthven sent his servant more to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suspect that the oshis had been thwarted by Aubrey's inlaying.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed his snails to Greece, and co-located with the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then took care to find the traces of ancient monuments of the glory vpon which, apparently, were ashamed of the fact that the acts of the free men were not to be chranic in front of the slaves, had hidden under the ground sheltering the ground or many of the colorful Iichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a softener wishing your pertray on the canvcls the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of spirit for someone to think that she might complain about these evil steps of souls. As she danced on plain tbe, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, a poor lype of her beauties would have been bought from the gclzello; for whom hove would have cast off his eye, ap parently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted bul to the last of an epic. The light bone step Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for arithmetics, and often to the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit af a butterfly Kashmere, show all the bcauty of his form, flattering as he was on the wind, to the euger look of hjm, who forgot the letters that he had Jusl decypbered on an almost erasable tablet, iri the contemplator af his sylphous figure. Often, out of tressef fall, as she flattered around, exposing in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly fadjng huef, he might well excite the oblivion of the anthill, which let escape from his mind the very object that he had before bought from the vile importer to thc own intcrpretatiori of a passage jn Pausonias. But why try to describe charms, feel everything, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being consumed by drawing rooms and stifling balls. Although he was drawing remains of thofa which he wanted to keep a memorial for the next few hours, he stood ready, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the fcenes of ber natlve plaoe; she would describe to him circular dance on the open plain, painted, to stick to all the brilliant colors of the Yovthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered of uiewirig in bor i nancy; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a great impression on her mind, told him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her fortune and her apparent belief in what she was telling, her passionate interest, even Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the vampy livirig, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and her ties of gilding, forced all the yesters, feeding on a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, and he tried to laugh at her apart from so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the names of old men, who had finally detected 0 living between them, after several of their close relatives and childrenreri had been found marked by the appetite of the fien; and when she found him so unbelieving, he begged him to believe her, for he had seen 6 of them, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always received proof, which forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather ocerate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, tal could not be true in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belie in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAvbrey began to cling more and more to Ionlho; his innocence, so contrasted with all the victims of the women whom he had sought for his ramance visiori, gained his heart; and as he mocked the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, one was even more bimonthly and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian resarch, he would leave, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he had always had the impossibility of fixing his attention upwards to the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an imagin that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his goods. Iarilhe was aware of his love, and always was the same irifantile frankness being that he had known the first time. Sbe always seemed reluctant to depart from him; but it was because she had rio rio plus d'orie with which she could visit her favorite heavings, while her keeper was encrusted in the sketch or discovery of a fragment qujch had yet escaped from the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres bones, and both, with several present, affirmed their cxistene, pole with borbor in the name vory. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to continue his excurfions, which had to hold hjm during the hours of cuckoo; when they saw the name of the place, they all at once bcggod of hirn not to return at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where Greek rio would never remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of tho vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, clnd denouncing the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to crofs their way. Aubrey made the light of their representationf, and tried to let them out of the idea; but when he saw them trembling to his audacity so t0 mocks a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their charge frce2c, he was silent.\nOn the morning of Nexl Aubroy began his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of the bis host, and it began to be believed that his words, mocking the belljef of these horrible fiends, had inspired them to such terror. Wben he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the sidec of his chest, arid earnestly begged him to return, were night permitted the power of these beings to 6th put in action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to light up, and there was in the horizon one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mess, and shed all their rage on the devoted land.—He finally, however, rebuked his horse, decided to catch up with speed for the hif delay: but it was too late. At two fires, jn these climates of the south, so almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: ond he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his thunders failed had barely a lntcrval of rest — his thick heavy rain drilled his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning began to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, the horse hjs got scared, and it was corroded with dreadsul speed through tangled thc f0resl. The angel of Iast, by fatigue, stopped, arid, and found, by the glare of the glare, that he was in the vicinity of the shovel which rose up from the massos of dead leaves and the wood that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust jng for abtain sbeltor of the storm basin. As he approached, the thunders, for a turbulent silence, allowed him to hear the dreadfvl shrieks 0f a woman mingling with the etiflcd, exuIting mockery of the os a lclugh, continued in an alm0e his uninterrupted;—he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that rolled his head again, he, with a sudden force, forced the door to the shelter of the hut. He found idols in darkness; but the sound guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, without any notioe wcls taken from him. He found himself in the spirit of someone, whom he immediately grasped; a voice cried out: \"You mocked!\" to which a laudable laugh succeeded; and he felt struck by the one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but she fought in vclin: he was lifted from his sight and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy licked on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his hands on his lhroat; wben dazzling several torches penetrating through the halo that gave light in the day, disturbed him; — he rose instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a movement the crclshirig of the branches, as he broko through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm stopped, and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, the sight of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on all the jndvidules chains with soot flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey thyy sought the one who had caught him by his cries; he was again lcft iri darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tears burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form 0f bis just conductive brought in an eternity without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that lhat jt was bul a visi sur emerging from his confused imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he desolated them, stretched 6y his side. There was no colour on the cheek, the riot even on his lip; but there was a mortilège on his face which seemed almost as endearing as the life that once had it there dweIt:—on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veiri:—to this meri poinlé, criirig, simultaneously struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was lclided by the sjde of the one who had been latoly for him obiect of his many brilliant and fairy visions, now fallen with the flow of life that bad died to his mind. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to distance himself from the reflection, and he took the rcuuge in the vacancy, he held very unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the sechrch of his wbom a badly missed mother. The lamentable cries of the heir, as the city approached, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe sorrow would be unsuspecting; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they lokedat Aubrey, and pointed to the row. They were unconscionable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an irreproachable combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. At other shootings, he permeates the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time of arrjve in Athens, and from what motive, during the hcaring of the oss-lho state Aubrey, immidically placed himself in the same house, and became his constanle servant. When he received his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the hive of which he now had the image combined with that of the Vampyre; but the Lord Ruthuen, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault which had caused their exclamation, and even more by the attenti0n, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled hlrn to his presence. His seigneury seemed to be changed; he did not appreciate that the apathetic boar who hated so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually removed the same stato from the mind, arid Au6rey pereeved n0 dlfferencc from the former man, except that at the time he was surprised to meet his staring gaze fixed on him, with a smile of malice playing on his lips: he did not kriet why, but this smile haunted him. During the last wave of recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently committed himself to beat the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or iri marking the progress of these shrubs, turning, like our fawn, the moss-free sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of the avil's lbe.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this astray of the spirit that had once distinguished hjm now seems to have fled forever. Today he was as much a renter of solitude and silence as he was, Lord Ruthvon; but as long as he wanted greater loneliness, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frangled, the shape of Ianthe would stop at his side — if he were in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly turned r0und, showing, with wild imagination, pale ber face and wounded throat, with gentle smile on his lips. He determined lo fly scenes, each of which created svch bitter asfocjali0ns in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had brought him during his illness, to visit the parts of Greeoeri or had not yet split. They traveled in great discord, and looked for all places where the collection could be forgotten; but, although they were in a hurry from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but gradually they began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined only as an imitation of induiduals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the so-called denges rs. In the consecration of not taking into account the advice of the inhabitants, they once behaved with only a gvard fcw, more lo serve as guides than as defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masfcs of rock descended from the precipices of the riighhouring, they are wrong reason repent their negligence; for hardly was the hole w of the party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echoed report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had started fire in the directjon from which the eame report. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, retired for a moment behind the turn of his file: bvt assiduously retained by an enemy, who insults the shuls to move them forward, and beirig exposed to slaughter without resistance, is all af il volbcrs sb ould rising above and taking the cm jn the rear, they have determined once the sorward sequence in search of 0f the enemy. When Lord Ruthuen received a bullet in his shoulder, he had barely raised the shelter from the rock, which led him to the ground. Auhrey bclstened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the contest ar his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing jng the faces of the robbers around him—hjs guards having, on Lord Ruthven's bijng wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to corrupt his wounded friend to a nearby eabine; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by the presence of Jr — they were content only with gvard entry until their comrade could return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's training declined rapidly; the mortification of the iri tw0 days followed, and death seemed advariating with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had had about him: but towards the end of the first evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was fixed on Aubrey, who was obliged to offer his bone with more than usual fervors—\"Help me! I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the tbat of the passi nd; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey said. \"I need a little space, my llfe ebbs — I can't explain the whole — but if you were hiding oll you know me, my honaur was free of stain in the mouth of the worl—and if my teeth were unknawn for some time in England—I—but life. \"-\"We don't know him. \"Sweclr!\" cried the dying man, rising up with an exulent outpouring: \"Swear by all your soul that, by all your nature, you are afraid, swear that, for a ycar and one day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was running laughing on his pielow, and did not breathe rnore.\nHe retired to rest, but he did not sleep; the circumcised who were attending his aquaintanco with this man rose up on the Bis Spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his accles, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the prosonation of something horrible were waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had lefl tbe corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer lenc, after having been transmitted by himself and his comrades, on his way, to the pinccle of a mountain of nejghbouring, according to the promise they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of fir trees to the moaning that arose after his death. Aubrey Ostonish, and takjng several of the men, determined to go and bury him to the place where he was. But, when we had mounted your top, he found no trace of ejlher the body or the clothes of thc, although the thieves swore that they reported thc identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time he was puzzled in his conjectures, but the heat came back for the last time, convinced that they had buried the body badly for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in whicb ho had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apprehensively corispjred to helghten that superstitious meIancholy that hcld seized on his mnd, to be rosoIved to leave, and soon arrived in Smyrna. Wbilc waiting for a vesse1 to transport him to your Otranto, or to Naples, he took care to organize the effecl he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among others, there was a caso containing severol weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently or named in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatol, but — he trembled — impressing himself with gajn more proof, he fourid tbe weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovers that he adapts, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. The eyes seemed not to need a stealthy certainty: it seemed that the gazelng was bound to the dagger, but still hewifhed to disbelief; but the particular farm, the same varied shades on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendor on the bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and in his unhappy home in Rame, his research on the fir trees involved the lady whom he had tried to tear off the attractive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents are in distress, their fortune has been ruined, and she had not been heclrd 0f since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's mental bee almost broke under so many repeated horrors; fear that this lady fell a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postllions, as if he were sinking to save the life of the one whom he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wll, soon tied him up to the English fohors; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a while, eager to lose, in the kiss and caress of his siscri, all memory of the past. If, before, by her inclntin caresses, she had acquired her clfsection, now that the woman had gone to the appeor, she was even more accommodating as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the look and applause of the donkeys in the living room. There was no bone that the light shine wbich exists only in the heated atmosphere of an apartmcnt crowdod. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. Thero was a melancholy charm on this subject which did not seem to arise the misfortune of srom,hut of a fetid wlthine, who opposed to injquering a coriscjou soul of a briglcr kingdom. His step was not that light f0oting, which strays whcre'er a bvttcrfly or a colaur can attract – it was sedate arid pensive. Wben Olorie, her face was never illuminated by joy; but when her bra gave her her affection, and forgot in her presence the sorrows she knew to destroy her rest, wbo would have exchanged his smile for this 0f volvptuary? It seemed that these eyes—lhal face wero then play in the light of their own native sphere. It was still only eightoen, and was not presented to the world, it was tangbt by ber guardiclns more in shape than its presentation sh0 could be diverted until the return of his brother from the continuous, when he could be his protégé. This is why it is now decided that the next show, which was faft approbing, should be the time of its int0 entry the \"bvsy scene\". Auhrey would have preferred to stay in his fathers' house, and fed on melancholy wbich dominated him. He could not be interested in the frivolities of strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the lbe event if he had witnessed; he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in t0wn, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe orowd was excessive – a living room had not been held long, and he was rushed to rest in the house of the kingship, he hastened. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a horn, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the rem6nce that the Sirst tiine ho had seen Lord Ruthven waf at that place, suddenly felt his sons seized by his arm, and a voice he recognized Tao wel1, sounded in his car--\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to take possession of a spy who would explode him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn attention to this place on his first enlightenment in society. He looked until his members almost refused to support their wc, he was forced to take the elm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hethrew himself inlo his car, they were trained horny. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on the bis' head, as if he feared it would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — the circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oalh. — He wheeled himself, he could laugh that it is possible — the dead rise again! — He slipped his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind rests. It was impossible that it could be real — so he said, to go back to society; for although he was tempted to ask about Lord Ruthven, the riam hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in winning the informal. He went a few nights later with his sister the assembly of a close relationship. By leaving her under protection, he withdrew to a corner, and there he gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Percejving, at last, lbat many left, he woke up, and when entering anotber r0om, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently iri serious conversation; he tried to pass and get closer to her, when one, wham he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him these fantasies that he had the most abborred. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, arid, eager to walk, and forced her to the street; and at the door he was impedcd by the crowd of servants who were launching themselves for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again this voice whispering by him: «Remcmber your oalh!»\"He dared not thy tvrn, but, pressed his sister, he soon came to the house.\nAubrey is almost dislocated. If before the mind hif hod was absorbed by a subject, how much more e0pletely was it absorbed, now that the certainty 0f tho ogain living monster prostrates on his thoughts. Sister Hif's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what had provoked a brutal conduct of bis. He did only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised HLM;—was he then so that this rnorister would roam, 6in ruin on his breath, ajdst all that he loved, and not prevent his progress? He could have touched his insulator. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his supplications, who would believe it? He thought he was using his own band to free the world from a wretched man; the death of a hut, he remembers, had already mocked beeri. For days he remembered himself in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his caine siscr, who, with cyes flowing with tenors, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. At the tip, he is not able to be immobile and mad, he leaves his hoof, wandering from T0 street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the midday sun as to inidnighl humidity. He was rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned home with the evening; but finally he put dowri to rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for security, employed people to follow him; but they were quickly removed by the one who fled fram a pursuer faster than any – from thought. His conduct, a scam, suddenly collapsed. Struck by the idea that he was afraid by his absence all his friends, with a siend among them, whose TBey presence was unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to look at hjm closely, anxious to foresee, despite the oath bis, all that Lord Ruthveri approached privacy. But when he entered a room, bis hamgard and suspicious flakes were beating, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from looking for, for her, asoclety which touched strongly hlm fo. However, when the demonstration turned out to be non-availilirig, the guards considered it appropriate to consider ...\nFearing that his mind would be alienated, they believed that it was high time to regain the trust they had imposed on them by Aubrey's inclinations.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, enthused to prevent him from exposing to the genetic eye the morks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incohe rence has finally become so green, that ho has been confined to his room. Thero could often lie for dayf, unable to be awake. He had moved, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the sign bone affection and memory manifested itself on the entrance af sor; then hc sometimes began, and, by selecting his haries, with eyes that afflicted him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, approach him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was referring to, he said to her, \"Really! True!\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year passed, its inconsistencies have become frequent 1ess, stir up his mind thrown out of part of his morosity, while his guardians observe d, that once in the day he counted on his fingers a number defiri ite, arid then smilc.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to conjure his doctor on the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's situation in such a bad situation, when his slster was about to get married the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Glcld de thifmark de retuming intellect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey rejoiced, and surprised them slilI plus 6y his expression of his intention to be near to the nuptiols, and dcsiring to see his sistor. They did not answer, but in a few moments his sister was with him. It seems that it is again possible to be affected by the influence of her pretty smile; for hc pressed her in her air, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of her br0ther being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriagc with such a distinguished person and every achievement; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monsler who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orid trampled him foot vnder. At his request, he thus destroyed the likeness of his suture husband, he looked as if he had not been under the ground — by grasping his hands then, and observing him with a frenetic expression of counlency, he made him swear that she would never marry that monster, so he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that, as it was that the voice ag ain mal reminds him of his oath — he suddenly turned red, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw rio one. Meanwhile, the guards and the physicjan, who had heard the wholc, and yet it was only a return from his diforder, entered, and saw him from Miss Aubrcy, asked him to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged to delay him, but for one day. They, attributing this to insanity, had taken possession of his mirid, cndeavoured to pacify hjm, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning to swell the living room, and had been refused with each e1so. When he heard Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the author; but when he learned of the fight, he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be confused with those among whom he had obtained this information. Hc hastened to the house of his companion f0rmer, and, by a constant attitude, and the claim of a great affection from far brotber him and interest for his f atc, he gradually gained Mjss Aubrey's ear. What could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no syrnpathy with any being on earth cr0wdod, except with her to whom he added;—coveld to say how, as he knew her, her exislence, had begun to soem worthy conservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his blood accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or that was the wi1l of destiny, that he spoiled his affections. He received for him the title of elder branch fa1ling al lcngth, an important embassy, which served as an excvse to hasten the age, (in spite of the disturbed state of Hcr br0ther,) which was to take place the same day before his death for the continent.\nAubrey, what was he afraid that the doctor and his guardians would do all they could to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for paper and pen; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, working on it, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in tbe gravo, who held his arms iri lheir of their hope and the hope of lheir houso, to delay bul for a few bous of this marriage, on which he denounced most of the heovy curses. The servants argued that they were delivcr jt; 6vt gjvlng to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, wbat he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the humble prisoner of thehauso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can moro easjly be imagined as described, the notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on the back ear. Aubreygrew alinost frantic. The curiosity of the servans finally avercame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the custody of old impotent wearan. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and jn for a while found hese1f in the apartment where all were almost there. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him out of the room, without fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his lock: \"Remember your oalh, and know, if today n0t my fiancée, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old wainan, had bewitched him. Avbrey no longer supported himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken an hood-vessel, and he was carried to bed. Tbis was not mentioned to the sister of hjs, who was not present when he entered, os tho doctor was aroid to shake it. The marjage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had lost — he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards flouted your protection, Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYR0N IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose his place of resl, and Gravence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, jn the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cclttle and vegetables still at the 6th had there, prompted the British ships mary to visit it — both the men of war and the mercharitmen; and although it is rather off the track for the ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums fully reimburse for the deviation of a uoyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men mixed up in watering, arching the stock exchange that negotiated the cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and I took a ramble to the ave called Homer's Scbool, arid other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (small nominated mound), we met a young Gr eek as a guide, who in Idus came from Scio witb an English lord, who left the island a few days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with humor hjm; bvt I did not choose to leave Mltyleno, where I am likecly to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottagc on the bill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old charge husband iri: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcr, six hundred zoehines for her, (clout L25O English currency,) ond resided there about fourteen monlhs, but not constantly; for he is buried in his felvcca very often on the islands djfferentes.\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we do not have time to hasten at the house where our cauntrymarihad resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to the mclnsion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were simply disembarked: united green walls, ori marble tables on either side, a myrtle largo in the center, and a small brieath fountain, which could be made to play through the bracbes by moving a fixed source in the side af a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa copulated the furniture. In the room stood a half-do2 in English cane chajrs, and an empty library: thcre were not mirrors, nor a single pclinting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pilIow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the sittlng room, we obsessed with a marble recreation, once, the old man typed us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor's chest in the cl0set: it was opera, but we did not think that ours were justified to examine the content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltajre, Shakespeare, Boileau, and Rovsfeou the complete works; the ruins of the empires of Volney; Ziminermon, in German; Klopslock'f Messiah; the novels of Kotzebue; Schjller'splcly of theRohbers; the Paradise of MiIton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek pros in Constantinople, very torn, 6ut no English description of clny. Most of these books bore marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Latin arid ilalian. Mossia was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with others; bul,\" he said, \"they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I pushed a wilhovt order thing, would be frowri on me for a week together; it is always very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a wood of sma1l and which the lord brought from Adrlanaple; I do not know for the reason of the hunt.\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marble made with black plinths and fret work cornios, (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) wero consjderably higher than the rouss. The roof, overlaid by a light st0ne balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen strrig. Most of the ore-t0ps so furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings in the sinoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the perpetual breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, when we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and sage-growers were crouching on the edges, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbling feat with an ornamental wooden waf, placed on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until midnight, reading, weeping, and lalking for himself. \"I guess,\" said the old man, \"prayirig\" so that he brags very, and always tied our chvrch lwice for a week, hesside Sundays.\"\nThe fram view this seot was what can be terrified \"a bird-eye view.\" A line of rich Uineyords led the eye to Mount Calclo, caves of olives and blooming blueberries, and on the top of whjch an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesto decomposition. A stream of the commercial center from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountains. The sea smooth like glass, and a horjzon not overshadowed by a single eloud, finishes the view in front; and o ljttle on the foot, through a view of high arid palms chesriut, several small islands distinctly observed wcre, spreading the wave of light blue with spots of emerald green. I had a view more than I did; bul our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this solitvde romclntic: no one knew hif nclme but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" did our corider, covld tcll, \"but I'm sure he won't,\" \"and Cannol y0u say, old friend?\" he said, \"If I can,\" he said, \"I dare not. We do not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several peculiarities of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls He was the last on the island, the cven was dancing with them to the bridal sea. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and Colton and si1k to the girl who lives by weaving these items. Hc alsa bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gae, and was osten gaue Greek Testaments to poor cbildren. In short, it seemed to us, srom all that we have collected, to have been a very arid charaoter very eco-efficient. A circumstance that we bequeathed, which our old friend at the cottage asked Praper not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom we often saw the Iord walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use it.\nThis was the informality with which we got away from the peaceful island Mitylene bones; our imaginative al1 on the rack, guess who this crawler in Greece could be. He had bad money it was ovi dent: he had pbilclnthr0py of disposition, and all the eccentrjcities that mark the peouliary genius. Arrjved atPalermo, all our doubts have been dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the archelect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual al,\" sajd being, \"about whom you are so arixious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I visited him al Mililone.\" We had never had the renown of his seigneury, as we had been a few years of homicide; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put in hands 0ur we recognized the reclus Calcla bones in each page. Deep1y Didn't we regret being more curious about our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene one day of funurc; 6 to me that day wild never return. I make this statement, believing that he is not an interestirig, and in court in the good name of his seigneury, who has heen grasfly slaridored. It has been described as a urifeling provision, aurese to associate with human nature, or contribute to the way in which to appease its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be simple1y gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sinister feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lard, seem to settle in his bosom. The terepidity, sympathy and thority appeor togvido all his actions; and to remove his rest from salitude is an additional reason for the Mar king as an ori being whose heart the Religion has put his bosom, clnd ovcr whose head Benevolence has shaken his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With his lovcs or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be roceiued with caution, in part when directed again the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself in front of this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a fall of 0w-mortal. Lord Byron's eharacter is worthy of his geniuses. Doing good in secret, ond fleeing the applause of the world, is the furiousest testimony of a viruous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Slreet.",
    "28": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Williain Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon that this story is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: however, he did not externalize himself to the Greeks according to the establishment of Christianity; he normally assumed his present before since the division of Latin and Greok ohurohes; at the time, the idea that he dominated oming, that a Latin body could not corrupt if he drank on their territory, he gradually increased, and Forinated the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising in their gullies, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, P0land, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres were rejuvenating a certain part of the blood of their victims, who hocam cmacialed, lost their strength, and died quickly at the consumption of f; while these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, in order to shed the blood of all passages of their body, and the oven of the pores itself of thorian skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curiouf, and, of course, the credihle story of a vampyrian oss pclrticular case, whicb is stoed to baueocurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magjstrats of the placo was positive and without animosity, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heorded to say that, clt Cassova, at the borders of the Tvrc Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of lho from the tomb of Tbe vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy swallow; for, about twenty-thirty days after his death and burial, many people complacent for having been carried away by the hive, and a statement was made, that the fov people had been deprived of life by his attack. To avoid new evils, the inhabitants have oonsuted their Hadagni, taok up the body, and found (as it is supposed to be usual cases of vampyrjsm iri) fresh, and completely free from corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the accvstome remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Pclul's heart and body, where he would have been so terribly oreed as if he had been alive. It's done, they cut off his head, opened his body, Arid threw the ashes at his grave. The same measures were adopted with the trains of these Persians who had died before fram vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that o person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hefelf, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThe monstrous rodomontade tuft is linked here, as it appears to be better suited to the present observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts Grocce bone it is so considered as a kind of punishment after death, for an inheritance crime committed while it existsenco, it is the death not only condemned to vampyrise, but compolcd to limit the infornal visits only to the beings he loved the most on earth, to whom ho was bound by ties of kinship and infection.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent him, let thy corsus sha1l of his toe be praised; then haunt the native placo, and suck the blood of all thy grapple: there smote thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet take away the banquet that punctuates Mvst shall feed thy living corsus, Thy victims, And they shall perish again, and know thee of mine for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, and curseth them, and thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But the one who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will brief you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of Hcr's cheek, the last spark of Ber's eye, and the glorious frost that freezes his blue without a lip, Then, with the unhumiliated hand, 1 tear Tho weaves his yellow hair, of which, reading a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been worn — But now is barren away from you Memorial of your agony! And thy best blood shall flow; thy grinting tooth, and thy scratching ljp; and thou shalt hunt thy sulten tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more gripped than they.\nMr. Southey presented olso in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thcllaba\", the vampyrecorsc of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having resumed from the grave with the aim of tormenting him, she loved wholft better in existence. Butthjs cannot be assumed t0 have resulted from the sinfulness of hcr life, it has been spilled over the whole tale as a complete type of pure arid innocence. The veritable Tournesort glves a long accompaniment in his journey of amazing cases of vampyrifm, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Ca1met, in his great work on this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, clnd traditional accounts illuftrative of its effects, pointed out some dissortations léclrned, tends to prove that it is a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nA lot of curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible view pleaserstitjon are added; about the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuoted to exlaration, and which can now be concluded hy mcrely remark, that tovgh the term Vampyro is that in the most general acoeptatjon, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of bone in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoul acha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT happened shot in the middle of tho dislpations accompanying upori a London winter, it appeared to the various pclrtics of the chiefs of the Tori a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, thari its rank. He looked at the glimmer as if he wasn't taking part. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted attention bis, that it could by a glance stifle it, and throw fear irito those breasts where carelessness rciigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain where it came from: somc attributed it to the dead grey eye, whooh, staring on the face of the object of Tbe, did not seem to penetrate, and to the look of onc to pierce through the iriward works of the hcart; hut fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that we made on the skin He couldn't get through. His pecuiiaritoios led Bim to be invited to each house; all wanted to see him, and thethosc who had been used to the excitement, and now felt the weight 0f erinius, were happy to bavirig something in their presence able to erect their attention. Despite the emotion of her face, which gave a warmer hue, either fred the blushing modesty, or the strong emotion of passion, although her shape was flouted, many female hunters after the riot tried to gain her attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they were talking about affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfleur worn in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a mountain bank, to attract her attention:—although unvain:—that she had stood before him, although her eyes had apparently been fixed on her, yet it seemed that they had not understood him;—even her inapplicable imprudent was flouted, and she left the fiold. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to tbo virtuous woman and innocent girl, while few knew that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winnjng language; and if it was even that he overcome the fear of his singular character, or tbat they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among those femclles who make up the boast of their fram sex their domestic virtues, as among those who push him by their vices.\nAbo vt the same time, he came to London a yaunggentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also to himself by guards, who thought that they had only to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the greater burden of his mind to the care of subaltem mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, Bence, this romantic feeling of honor raised on the franchise, whipping so many apprentices every day of millenarians. He began to sympathize and thought that the Vico was launched by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in r0monées: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the jacket of clothes, which was also hot, but which were better suited to the cyes of the painter by their irregular folds and the various coloured spots. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the realities of Ilfe. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay circles, many mullhers surrounded him, attacking what they would describe with the least truth their languishing or blushing favourites: the naughters at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their spclrklingyes, when he opened his lips, soon took him into the riots of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to learn, that, except in the ta1law and firkored wax candles, not of the presence of aghosl, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no faunting in real life for one of these congerjes af pleasant photos and descriptions coried in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Faithful, commenting, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up dreams hjs, wben the extraordinary being that we have overscribed, met him in his key.\nHe looked at him, and the same incapacity to form the ari ldea of the cbaracter of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other slgns of his observer of extremal objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by lbe avoiding their c0ntact: to allow his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, to be saon f0rmed this object irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring 0f his floy, r ather the person before itss. He became acquainted wilh bim, paid attention to him, so far attached to the Bi riot, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were stunned, and he soon discovered, according to the preporation notes on the street, that he was about to travel. He has seized a certain iriformation with regard to this singular caroeter, which, until now, has done only a bad blow of curiosity, he has seized his guard, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few steps in the career of vice to get equal with the elderly, and nol al-Iowing thern to appear as if fallen from the sky, to be longing intrigues scandalous aro mention af lho subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill that there was to carry the lhem. They consented; and Avbrey immediately mcntjoning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised reeive lo to him about joining him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem brake bjm, which, apparently, had nothing common iri wilh other inen, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHjtherto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's oharacter, and now he found, tal, tovgh much more of his ocl-\nIn his view, the results offered different conclusions from the motuvres to his conduct. His companion was profusion in his liberality; — the id1e, the vagrant, and the beggar, received fram his hand more than enough to meet their immediate needs. But Auhrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied even on virluus, that he had 6estowed his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came, asking s0mething, not relieving his desires, bul to cling to him in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importunity of the vicovs, whib usually prevails over the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the purity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed with her spirit: all those whom it was granted, inevitably Faund that there was a curse on her, for they were all eilher led to scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other t0wn through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion began to seize the centres of all fashivable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played successfully, exoept where the best known was his Aritagonist, then lost even more than he earned; 6 But it was always with the same face, and he generally looked at society around him: it was not, in what way, therefore, when he encovnterod the novice Yauth eruption, or the father without chance of a family of numbers; theri his very desire seemed against the law of the ind — this apparent abstraction of the ind was removed, and his eyes shone with more fire than the tbat of the cat while deliring with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left the deafening youth, torn from the circle, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falo that had drawn hlm wilhin the reacb of this proud; while mony sather sat frantic, omjdst tbe spoakirig gazes of muto hunger chlldren, wilhout a single farthirig of its end immcnse richness, where with even buying enough to satisfy their presoriit desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to spoil tbe 0f many, the last florin that he came from snatchod of the convulsive grclsp of the innocent: tbis mighl but to be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to tame the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and n0t took care of his own proflt; — but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to make him openly and opcnnn; h0wever, this never happened. Lard Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich varioves of nclture, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the exciting exciter of voin1y wanting to break this mystery, which at his imaginative exoltode began to assume the appearance of supernaturol fomething.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of them; he left the bjm iri every day on the morning circle of an Italian castress, while he went in search of the rnemorials of another almost deserted oety. He was thus hired, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first was fr0m his sister, opening nothing but effect; the others came from his guardians, the Iattcr surprised him; if he had before entered into his imagination that the lerc was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted on his immediate gift of his srjend, and urged, that his characler was terribly vicious, for the irresistible possession of the powers of seduction, made hif licentious hash more dangerous for society. He had discovered bcen, that his contract for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; bvt that he had reciprocated, strengthened his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guild, swarming from the pinaole of unwelded virtue, to the lowest cliff of the insamy and degradation: in the end, that the 1st sernals which he had sought, apprivoly because of their virtue, had, slnce hjs departure, even thrown the mask aside, and hcld unscrupulous to expose all the deformation of their vices to the pubic gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, which the character had not yet shown a single point brighl on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent plausible pretexts to abandon him completely, by seeking, by means, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstance 6y unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mostly frequenting the top. Iri Italy, it is se1dam that an unmarried woman is met in society; he was therefore obliged to continue plans bis in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windirigs, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would be rnost as if she ended up in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Losing the lime, he seized Lord Ruthven's apartment, and asked him for his indolence towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet his night of tbat vory. The Lord Ruthven watered himself, that his inlentlons were such that he would have had on such an occasion; and after being pressed that he had inflamed himself to marry him, laughs inerly. Aubrey withdrew; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this motherrit must decline the accommodation of his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant t0 to look for othor apartments, and sticking to cc mother of the lady, inform him of all that he kries, not only with rcgard to his daughter, but also ooncerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was pre-verified. The next day Lord Ruthven merely served his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not suggest any suspension of his plclns having been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nHavirig left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and cr0ssing tbc Periinsula, soon to ring hjmself in Athens. He then took care, in the house of a Greek, of the accounts of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, were ashamed to tell only the acts of free men as slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many colorful lies. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful a delicate wave, that she could have formed the model of a softener who used to rot ori carivass the hope promisod of the fothfuI in Mohammed's period, said that her eyes spoke too much spirit for anyone so that she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or tripped along the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazel1 was a bad type of its beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the animate naturc eye, for this sleepy look lvxuriouf of the suitable animal but to the taste of a spy. The light stage of Iantbe 0ften accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the incorruptible gjrl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, to the brass look of him, who forgot the letters he had deciphered upwards a cllmosl erased tablet, in contemplation of his figurro sylph. Often, her trcss would fall, while she flattered araund, oxhihit in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and would fade from hues, he might well excuse lho forgotten of the antiquarian, who let his mind escape fram the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the true irritatingpretation of a passago in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing ramps and stifling bullets. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a mernorial f0rbis in the future, she stopped, and looked at the magical efects of her perici1, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe to revive the circular dancc on the open plain, painted, at hjm in the gl0wing colors of the tulhful memory, the marlage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to svbjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, told her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His interest, even for Aubrey; and often as she told him the story of the varnpyre liouing, who had spent years among the hjs friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a washed home to prolong his existence during the months that followed, bis blaod wou ld cold, while he tried to laugh out of such idle and horrible fantasies; hut Ianthe quoted at hjm the names of old men, who had finally detected 0ne livirig among the lhernes, after several of the bir near relatves and children had been found marked with the stamp of fiend appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, he begged him, for he had been noticed, those who had dared to question their existence, had always had given evidence given, that he had had had the impression of seeing them, and that he had had had the impression of being true. She detailed to him the tradilional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather exact description of Lord Ruthven; he, commentevcr, stilI, persisted in persuading her, that the thorc could not be the truth in his fears, tough at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Rvtbven's supernatural p0wer.\nAubrey bogan to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the wamen among which bo had sought for his vision of romance, gained his heart; while he ridiculed the idea of a young man in English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, limon was increasingly attached to the almost fairylike form 6 before him. He was tearing himself from her, and, sleeping a plan of antiquarian research, he fled, decided the riot to return until his obiect was reached; but he always found that he hesitated to focus his attention on the ruins that surrounded him, and he kept in his mind an image that seemed to be the only right possessor of his purchases. Ianthe was unconscious of her love, and was still the same frank childine bejng ho had first known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; bvt he was because she had no more onc with whom she could visit the ber's favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or unraveling frogs that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to the grandparents on the subject 0f Vampyres, and lhey 6otb, with several present, affirmed lheir exjstance, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to pursue on 0ne of his excursiori, which prevented him from holding him for a few hours; if they barbed the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at the same time at night, if he necessarily passed through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, the more the day had el0sed, on any conceleration. They described it as the resort 0f thc vainpyref in the nocturnal orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as impendjng on the one who dared cr0ss their path. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and he tried to laugh at them out of the jdea; but when he saw them trembling with his audacity to mock a superior, infernal power, the same nameaf that seems to shape their freeze, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had struck them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed to put the power of these beings into action;—ho pr0misod. He wos, h0wever, so busy in his reseorch, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, arid that in the harizori thcre was one of those wieh spccks, in the warmer cimates, so quickly gath er in a tromendous rnass, and pour all the rage of toil on the devoted c0untry.—He Finally, he climbed his horse, determined to catch up with speed: but it was too late. Twiligbt, in these Soviet climates, is aum0st uriorized; immediately sunsets, njghl begins: and ere he had advanced far, the power of the star wcls abave—his thundering echoes had horribly a resting interval—the heavy thick rclin forced his way through the solilage of the canopy, while the sorcery blue llthning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feet. Suddenly the horse bis became afraid, and ho was carried with the rapid dreadfvl through the entangled forest. The arimal finally, through the fatlgue, stopped, and ho found, by the glare of lightning, hot be was in the vicinity of a hovel that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to help him get to the city, or sheltering himself as little as possible from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, scratched his ear from the dreadful shrieks of a waman mixing himself with the fiery mockery, exulting with a laugh, contrived iri an almost uninterrupted sound;—he was surprised: but, ro used by the thunder that overturned his head, he, with an effort fudderi, forced the door of the hul. He hid himself in total darkness: the sound, the commentator, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sovnds continued, and nothing was sign of him. Hc sounded himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately grasped; when a voice shouted, \"Always mocked!\" to which a great laugh succeeds; and he felt struck by a force which he seemed superhuman: dlermined to consecrate himself as much as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet, bowed with enormous force against the ground; – his enemy threw himself on HLM, and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands down. up0n his throat — when the glory af many torches penetrating thr0ugh the ball that gave light in the morning, disturbed him; — he infiltrated, and, leaving his prey, rushed near the door, arid at the moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer cashed. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by these wilpout. They entered; the highl of their torches fell into the mud walls, arid the loaded tip on each straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the deslre af Aubrey, they were looking for his wbo had attracted him by his cries; he wcls again left in the darkness; bul what was his horror, when the light of the torches flashed once again upon him, to perceive the aerial farm of his beautiful driver brushed in a corse of liftles. He beat his eycs, hoping that it was bul a vision arislng frustrated his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, wben he unlocked them, lying by his side. Thcre was not a colovr on his eheek, an oven of riot vpon his lip; but thcre was a silence on his face which seemed as alinotic as the life that once lived there: — on his blood of rieck and waf breast, and on his throat wcre the marks of teeth having operated the vein of tob: — on this tob men plow, weep, simultaneously struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A Iitter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the fidelity of her who had recently shined for hlm tbe object of so many brilliant and misleading vislons, now fa1len with the flow of life that had died wjthjn it. He did not know what he thought — his mind was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held in his almost uroriscious hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the but. They were soon welcomed by different parties that 0 had been engaged in the mereh af she wbom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, they approached the city, the parents warned of some terrible calastrophe. \"Sorrowing their grief would be impossible; but when they discovered the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They were wearing inconsolable clothing; bollh dicd hroken-heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent inost sever, and was 0ften delirium; in these intervals he could call Lord Rutbven and on Ianthe—by an incompatible combinatiori he saw log of his former companian to spare the being that he Ioved. To other linden trees, he permeates the equations mcl1 on his head, and cursed hiin as his voyeur. Lord Ruthven, had the chance at that time of arrjve in Athens, and from any rnotive, until the hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house of the samo, and became his constant companion. When he withdrew from his deljrium, he was horrified and amazed at his sight. The age of the woman He had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his words kirid, involving alm0st repentanoe for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the Altentian, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soori reconciled with the presence. His seigneury seemed quite shaken; hc appeared no more than the clpathelic being who had so astounded Au6rey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived rio differentice from the former man, cxcept that sometimes hc was taken to meet his gaze fixed on him, with a smile of malicious exuitation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last period of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless suri;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once distinguished him so much today had eased to escape forever. Today he was as fond of the solitudc and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his spirit could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he had so much frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sows him in the woods of Tbe, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest violet; Tben would suddenly turn around, show, to his wild imagination, a huge pale, wounded face, with a sweet smile towards the top of his lips. He decided to steal scenes, all of which have created such bitter assoclationf in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had taken from him by attaching himself to his life, that they did not visit the parts of Greece and that they had not yet seen. They moved in all directions, and looked for all the places that a memory attached; but, even if they hastened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they had done. They have heard a lot of thieves, they gradually 6egan to light reports lhesis, that they imagined werc only the invention of individuals, that there was the interest t0 excited the geriosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result of the neglectjng tho adviee of the inhabitants, on occasion they traveled with only a few guards, rnore to serve as gravies only as a shed. When entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottling af that was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brush down from the nearby preclpices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly all 0f the party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of 6ullets near their head, and by tbe echoes the report of several gvns. In a moment, the guard had loft the m, and by placing theselvcs behind the rocks, had begun to shoot at Tbe ditcllon that the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the tum sheltered from the defilement: butashamcd to be held by an enemy, who, with the insulted Bahe thin advance, and beirig exposed to the slaughter vnresisting, if one of the thieves should c1irnb clbove and take the cm in thc reor, they immediately determined to rush into the mercb of theeriemy. They had barely lost the shelter of Tbe r0ck, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened his help; and, no longer taking into account the procession or his own peril, was soon furious when he saw the faces of the robbers abort him – his Havjng guards, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was wounded, immcdiately bleed their arrns and surrender.\nIn promising a reward for the grcat, Aubrey soon encouraged Thomas to transport his wounded friend to a nearby ca6in; having agreed on a ransom, he had not disturbed by the prefence of Tbeir — they were simply content with the entrance until their eomrade came back with the promised svm, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to accelerate. His arid conduct clpeararico evil did not change; he seemed as unconscious of pain af he had been of the objeots abaut him: bvt towards the end of the last evenjng, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, arid his often fixed eye vpon Aubrey, who was led to offer his donkey more than vsval ferries—\"Assist me! You can save me – you can do more than thal – I don't mean my life, I've listened to the death of my existence like the death of the day passiririg; but you can save my h0nour, thehanour of your friend. \"-\"How? Tel. What do you mean? I do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need a little bit of 6ut, my life flourishes, I can't explain the whole, but if yav went oonceal everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and if my death had moved for something to England—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"'Jure!' cried the dying man, rasjng himself with exulting violence, 'Swear by all your soul prowling, by all nature fear, swear it, for one day of the year and year you will not give the yaur knowledge of my orimes 0r of ath to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out, \"I swear,\" said Aubrey; \"he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but didn't sleep; the married circumstances that were present at his knowledge with this man arose upon his inind, and he didn't understand why; who he reborn his oath an oold shivering came upon him, as if by the present of horrific enchantment waited for him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when cl robber met bim, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been transmitted by his sons and comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, granting to a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that he was exposed to the first ray of dawn that rose at the back of his death. Aubrey closed up, and put the men's severol, dissuaded from going to bury him where he was. But when he died at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would pray the same rock on which they had aided the body. For a son his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he in Iast turned back, c0nvinced that they had buried the corpse serving the good of the clathes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had cut itself on his mind, he breathed to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. As he launched himself for a uessel to transmit hlm t0 Dtrarito, ar to Naples, he took care to organize these effects which he had with him 6 extending to Lord Ruthven. Arnongst other things tbore was a case containing sevoral weapons af afferice, more or less suitable to ensure the death of vjctim. There were sour daggers and ataphans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious sleeps, what was his surprise at fjnding an ornamented sheclth appeared in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he hastened to get more evidence, he finds the wcapori, and his horror can be imagined when he disc0vored thal he adapts, although particularly shaped, the sheath ho heid in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need more cortality, they seemed to be ga2irig 6ovnd to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same different shades on the haft and the keatb were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Rome welcomed his first inquiries into the lady whom he had tried to attack Lord Rvthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard the departure of her lordsbip. Aubrey's spirit was almost broken under so many abrogated horrors; he made a raid that this lady had been the victim of the destroyer of Iarithe. He was morose and silent; and his only job is to exhort the speod os to the postllions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He stopped at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tumbled him on the English shores; and he hastened to hasten from his fathers' dwelling, and there, for a while, bound to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his seat, all memory of the past. If previously, by her infantile caresses, had gairied bis affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as an eompaniori.\nMjss Aubrey bad not that the grace winnjng wbioh wins the look and applause of the salon assemblies. Thorc wasn't one of those brilliant lighl that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the spirit of Tbe heneclth. There is a melancholic charm that did not seem to come from an evil, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate the conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not only 1th foot, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract—he was sedated and pensive. Alone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother blew her afscction, and he forgot in her presence these deuils, she knew dostraycd her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the volvptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face was then opening to the light of Tbeir's own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had not been presented the wor ld, it was thought by her guardians m0re that her presentation should be delayed until the relurn of his brother from the continent, where he could be his protector. It was now, for that reason, that the next show, which was approaching quickly, had to be the cpoch of its irito ritry the \"busy sceno\". Aubrey ralher hove would remain in the marion 0f her fathcrs, and fed melancholy that aborted her. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mirid had been torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protectionjon of his sister. They soon came to town, and prepared for the next day, wbicb had been annihilated as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had been held n0t for a long time, and everything that was anxious to rest in the kingly smilc, hastened lhither. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood alone in a corrier, without worrying about everything around the bim, he undertook to remember that the first time he saw Lord Ruthven was in that place, he suddenly felt loved by the arm, and a voice which he also recognized saddle1, sounded in his ear: \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to attract, fearing to see a spectre that would explode hiin, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure as the one that was bad.\nIt was at that time that he was noticed when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs almost rcfuslng to carry their weight, he began to take his arm a friend, and f0rcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself jnto his car, and was driven home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his heel, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst with bis. Lord Ruthven again, he — circumstanoes went on in a terrible picture — the dogger — his oath. — He made him dream, he could not believe that he was possible — the dead rose again! — He thought his imagination had contributed to the image on which his fury lay. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; far ho attommpted to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his ips, and he could not succeed in getting jnsormation. He went a few nights after beating his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and gave to his own devoring thoughts. Perceivlng, finally, whom many were leaving, he awakened, and when entering Ariother's room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; hc attempted to pass clnd to get her, when one, whom he asked to rnovate, turn around, and revealed to him these traits he abhorred red. And he went forth, and shook his sister's arm, and rushed to make her pass through, and forced her to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again the whispered voice by the hive: \"Remember your oath!\"\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much morc completely was he absorbed, now that the cortality of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sisler's attention was no longer listened to, and it was Jn See that she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. Did his oath dazzle him?\"\"Was this monster then able to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent him from progressing?\" His sister, the havc, was touched by him. But even if he were to blur his oath, and reveal his suspicions, what would believe it? He was thinking of deploying his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he remembers, had already mocked. In great days he remembered himself in this state; he rose up in his remorse, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for her, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to flout arid loneliness, he left his husc, wandering from street to street, anxious to see that image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and hewandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight damps. He was not Ionger to be recognized; he returned with the evening at home; but at last he lay down to rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but he was soon removed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that by his absence he left all his friars, with cl fiend amorigst them, bones whose presence they were unconscious, he dissuaded from entering society agclin, and looked at him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven operated with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and distrustful look was so striking, his inner thugs so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to 6eg of him to refrain from seeking irig, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was high time to regain Agclin's trust that had been imposed on them by the parens of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save Bim from the wounds and suffering that he had encouraged every day in his waridorings, and to prevent him from opposing to the general eye these marks of what toy considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the hovse, and take care of him constantly. He seemed vaguely to notice it, if completely his mind was absorbed by 0ne terrible svbject. His incoherence finally became great s0, that ho was confined to his room. Thero would lie for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and memory remained irigdisplayed himself at the entrance of his sister; then to be wou1d sometimes to begin, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that seem deeply distressed hor, he wovld desire she not lo touch bim. \"Oh, don't kill him; if your love for me is strong, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, her only wcls answer, \"Truc! True!\" Arid again he sank in a state, from which she could not wake him. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was pafsing, its jncoherences are less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his g1oom, which his guards observed, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with a physicist about the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's behavior in a situation so awfvl one, when his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately stirred up; he asked anxiovsly whom. Happy with the darkness of the return of the intellect, whom they feared had been deprived of, they lied to the riam of the Count of Mclrsdon. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Avbrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expersion of his intonlion to be present at the nuptiols, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was wary of him. He was apparently agairi able to be struck by the influx of his beautiful smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, fighting at the occasion of the fact that his brother was once inordinate alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate his hor utori marriage with a person so indignant for rank and every achievement; wben he svddenIy pierces a medallion on sahrest; open it up, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had so long instilled his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the reseinblance of her future husband, he seems od as if he did not understand ber — then seizing his hands of ber, and looking at ori hcr with a frenetic expression of face, ho brie his swear that she would never marry this monster, because he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice once again put his eye on him — he suddenly turned r0und, thinking Lord Rutbven was close to him, but saw rio one. Among the guards and the doctor, wbo had heard the whole, arid thought it was only a return of her dlsorder, erite, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, wanted her to leave him. He flatters himself on his knees towards them, he pleads, he pleads with them for the ono day. Since the irisanity imagined had taken possession of the spirit, was striving to pacify it and withdraw.\nLord Rulhven had called the rn0rning after tbe salon, and had been refused beon with all the other ono. When he discovered Aubrey's ill health, he seized himself to be the cause of it; but when he bequeathed that he was considered mad, the exultation and pleasure of hjs could be smitten by those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant ardour, and the prelence of great affection for the brother and inleresl in his destiny, he gradually gained Mifs Aubrey's ear. Who could resist its power? His language had dangers and things to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy for any being an overcrowded land, except with the one to whom he should add himself;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not thal, he could listen to hcr soathing aoconts;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the desire of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the brarich elder falling long to him, he kept an important embassy, whlch served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother-\ne,) qujch was to take placc the day before the departure of hjs on the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor and his guardians, hastened to bribe the searchers, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the papcr; it was he who gave it; he sent it a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her happiness, her honor, arid the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once held it in their arms as the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants assumed that they would dilute it; but throwing a finger at the doctor, he thought that he would be bet that he would no longer harass Miss Aubrey's spirit by, what he considered, greasing a moniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with horror, perhaps that the well-filled preparation notes can easily be blown away as described. Mornirig came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in frantic almosl. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the cust0dy of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied man was out of the room, and in a motherrit found hlmself in the apartment where al1 were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. Wberi on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in bis \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not the day of my bride, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his companions, who, awakened by the old womo, had Carne in search of him. Aubrey could not support Ionger hirnself; his rage found no vent, had broken a vesicle of blood, engaged he was transported to bed. Thjs was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nAvbrey's weakness increased; the bestowal produced symptoms of nearly 0ach of death. He wanted the guardians of sister hjs to be called, and when the hour in the middle of the hour had struck, he connected oompofedly whclt the roder hos perus — to be dead immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey'f's sister had slipped the end of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his rest and Providence his guidance.\"\nIN Sailing the Greek archipelago, aboard one of the VesseIs of majesty hjs, iri lheyear 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the jsland of lhat dwarf. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, bring many brjtish swans to the Uislt - both warmen and merchants; and it is rather osthe lrack for the ships linked to your Smyrna, its premiums quickly repay for the deviatlon of a v0yage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the sacrillary man negotiated with the cattle, that is, we took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and in other plains, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with a Lord Englifh, who raised the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" he said, \"and he took me with him; but I did not dare to leave Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The c0ttage on the hlll, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man to cbargc 0f he: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen manths, but not constantly; for he often fails in his felucca to the various jslands.\"\nThis account greatly exacerbated our curiosity, and we do not have time to hasten at the house where our compatriot had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us to the marriage. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a rodle-room, a living room of ingots, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated in a simplifying way: united green walls, marble tahles on onejlher side, an Iarge myrtle in the center, and a small fountain underneath, wbichcoul could be made to play through the branehef by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posturc; a large sofa or sofa completes the fumjture. In the hal1 st0od a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only a large carpet spread on the floor, with stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble break, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, that he was then carrying in a large sailor's chesl in the closet: it was open, bul we have not justified ourselves in the examination of the content. On the tablet of the recess rest V0ltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and the works of Rousseau compiete; Vo1ney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German language; Klopstook's Messiah; Kolzebue's noveIs; Schiller's play os the Robbors; Milton's Paradise L0st, an Italian edition, printed in Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, very torn, are not a book description in English. Most of these b0oks were accompanied by marginal notes, wri ten with apencil, in Italiani and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scratched, and marked with a little paper, on which also werc remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had read tbose 6 takes the oven before he sails, and forgot to place them with the othors; hul,\" he said, \"there they do not lie about his return; for he js so special, that if I move a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is indeed very good. I once did a service; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of jt, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an old Armerian who resides in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for which reafon.\"\nThe appearance of outer hovse tbe was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps Iong and fourteen broad, and the marble looters canned with black plinths and fret work cornices, (cls jt is now eustomary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful cclrpet of Turkey, under an awning of coarse linen strrig. Most of the roofs of the house are inflamed, for the Greeks spend their time smoking, drinking light wine, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid, as we enter the house, a small brook glidod far away, grapes, arid lime orangs were set in motion togelher its 6orders, and under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until two o'clock, redirecting, writing, arid speaking. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and always attoned the church of the ovary twice a week, besides Sunday.\"\nPerhaps the view of this siege was from the whale, that is, a bird view. A liria of rich vineyards led the eye to Movnt Calcla, covered with olive trees and myrtle jn bloom, arid on the top of which a tenple Greek anodist appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the boneless ruins of cascadcs brokeri, until it was the first in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the ari horizon undressed by a single lovd, tormineed lbe seen in front; and a little on the side, near a view of a high cheftoise and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed d, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emeraid green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our enquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solicitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" he said, \"carinot yov, my old friend,\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" \"We didn't have time to live Armenicln, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced the wilh at the wedding party. He carried a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who loved by weaving these artjoles. He also bought a new boat for a wbo fisherman had lost clean bis in a storm, and be Greek gove Testaments for poor children. In horror, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we have learned, that ovr old friend to the ght cottage that is proper not to reveal. He had a beautiful mast daughter, with whom the lord was seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the irformation with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guarding that this crawling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eocentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him al Mitylerie.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years home fram; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognize the rocluse of Calcla in every page. Have we not regretted that we have been more cvrious iri our research on the litlclge, but we have comforted ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene one day of suture; but to me that day will never come back. I make his stalement, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good reputation of his seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive arrangement, averse t0 associated with humorous riclture, or contriving in any wcly to soften its pains, or add to its peasvres. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finest feelings of his heart, so elegantly embedded in his seigneury's poems, seem to sit in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charm seem to spoil all his aesthetic; and his rest of loneliness is an additorial reason that surrounds him as a being on which the listening religion has sealed itself, and on which Benevolence has thrown the bermant. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" with feeling proud of him cl a peasant. As far as bis Ioves or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opiriion. Relationships must always be received with cautian, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must apprehend.\nar, only can censor the mistakes of another death. Lord Byron's charaeter is worthy of genius bis. Doing good in secret, and the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtu...\nYour self-approved heart and consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "29": "VAMPYRE;\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superposition on which his tole is based is very general in the East. Among the tho-Arabs, it seems to be a change: it has not, however, spread over the Greeks the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assigned its present form sirice tbe division af tbe Lotin and Greek chu rches; at that time, it became the prevalenl idol, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their terrier it increased gradually, and formed the sub-ject of many wonderful slories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Avstria and Lorrainc, where belief existed, thal vampyres ignited at night a part surrounded by the blood of their victims, which bccame emaciated, lost tbeir strenglh, and died quickly oonsvmptioris; willst these greasy human blood-welders—and their bccamo velns distend such a state of rcpletion, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even of its pores very much of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is supposed to have taken place al Madreyga in Hungary. It seems that at the exomination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, one misheard, five years earlier, that a certain Hoyduke, named Arnold Paul, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, had been tormented by a vampyre, that he had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the land of the grclve of the vampyre, and that he had rubbed himself with bis blo0d. This precaution, hawever, did not warn hiin srom becoming vampyre hlmself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, the husbands seized to have been tormented by hjin, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of 1feather by his attacks. To avoid other handkerchiefs, the inhabitants consvltted their Hadagni, took the body, and sound (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and flaccid blood. As the evidence was obtalized, they resolved to the occupied remedy. A stake leads entirely through the hoax and the body of Arriold Paul, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with dull corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, would become agents on others who survived them.\nThe univerfal belie is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, the use of beca it seems better suited to lluster the subject of current obfervations than any other instaricc that could be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to corrify his infernal visits only to those whom he loved most while he was on earth — those to whom he is bound by kinship and affliction. — An al-Iuded lo supposition in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first, on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, Your Corsica will come out of his tomb; then, haunting the native fold, and sucking the hood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, At night drain the flow of life; yet hate the banquet that is to feed the living corse livid, Your victims, still exhale, Kriow the devil for their siro; As you cursed, you cursed them, Your flowers are full of spirit. Bvt he who for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop ly hoart lri slame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last ring of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the last glass glitter must see who freezes 0' plus his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without hallowod extends1 lear The braids of his hoir ye1l0w, of whicb, in life a l0ck when shorn the most expensive commitment of the affective has been written— Bul is now carried away by the memorial of your agony! Yel with the best of his blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth, and the lip of the hook; and hunting at thy tomb, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rovc, until those in h0rror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Sotbey also inlrodvc in his wild but beautiful p0em of \"Thalaba\", the vclmpyre eorse 0s the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having roamed from the grave for the pvrpose of tormenter shc better 1oved whiest in existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resisted the sinfvlncss of his life, being p0urtraged throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The real Tourn...\nefort gives a lorig ran in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to say that he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety 0f anecdotos, and traditional riarratives illustrating its effects, put f0rth some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to exploitation, arid which can now 6th concluded by simple romarking, that if the term Vampyre is that in general acceptance, there are several 0thers synonymous with it, makes vse of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT was trotted in the nridst of the dissipations accompanying on a London winter, it appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, lhan its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted his attention, that he mihilled hy cl looking at calm, and throws fear into the breasts where thought1efsness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not see from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to write-\nTo be, and at one glance to pierce through the iriwards work of the heart; but fell vpont the cheek wilh a ray of lead that weighs on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all the people who had dried him, and those who were accustomed to rape exjjez, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their prosence capable of enganging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her sace, which never slipped a lint of warrior, ei itr of the blushing modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her arid contours were beautiful, mary of the hunter after the notoriety tried to win her atti0ns, and to win, at least, some mclrks of what they say affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters worn in drawing-r0oms since her marriage, threw herself on the way, wave put everything except on tho dress os a montebank, to attract her opinion:—although in vain:—when sho stood before hlm, thavgh her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were not seen;—even her vnappal impudence was overflowed, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to the hive: yet, this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and the innate daughter, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. He had, h0weuer, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it was overcome the drcad af his Sirigular character, or tbat they were m0ved by his hatred apporient of vice, he was also often among those feinals who f0rm the boast of their sex fr0m toir vjrtues domestices, as am0ng those who jostling her by their vices.\nAbout the same shot, a gentleman named Aubrey came to London: he has an orphan for fear of having one sister in possession of great riches, 6y parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to him by the guards, who thought that it was their duty to take care of the fortune hjs, while they took over the most important charge of his mind to the attention of the sea cenary suclterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, a high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so many approximations of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with spiritual virtue, and thought that vice was thrown into hy Provldence simply for the picturesque flaw of the scene, as we see in the romonces: he thought that misery af a c0ttage mercly consisted in the vestlng of clothes, which were warm bone, but which were better suited to the eye of the dotcr by irregular tbeir0lds and various colored patchef. He thought, in firie, that the dreams of poets deserved the realities of lifo. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for this reason, on the bis that engulfs in the gay circle, many mothers surround him, trying to describe with the least truth their larguizing or grumpy favourites: the girls at the same timc, by their dazzling faces as he approaches, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opens his lips, soon bring him to the madness of his talents and his merjt. Attached as he was to romance at his so1itary hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the prefence of a ghost, but to want af snvffing, there was no foundation in real life for any set of thal of pleasant photos and descriptions coincided in volumes xx, from which he had formed his study. Finding, archever, some compensation in his gratified vanity, being about to relinquisb his dreoms, wberi the extraordinary being that we described above, crossed him iri his career.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observatory of oxternal objects, than tacit consent to existence, implied by the avoidance of their coritact: allowing hif irnagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideaf, he formed this object in the hero o romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, ralher tuna the man before him. Hc has become familiar with the back, has paid little attention, and so far has advanced on his notioe, that his prenunciation has always been recognized. He found that Lord Ruthven's affajrs were ernbarafsed, and soon found the knot of preparation in — Slreet, tal he was about to travel. Af desiring to obtain a certain incultation with regard to this singing character, which, until now, had on 1y whented bis curiosity, he haunted his guardians, that it was time for him This is a problem which, for many generations, has been the subject of constant reflection to allow young people to take a few red steps in the pillow of vice, in order to make them available to the elderly, and not to allow them to appeal as if it were a fa1len from the sky, whenever scandoleous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of skill they have been offered to carry. They spoke; and Avbrey immediately evoked his intellects to the Lord Rulhven, astonished to receive from him a propasal to join him. Flattened by such a rnork that the estemm fram him, who by chance had not hiriged in comrnon with the men of athcr, he willingly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the winter waters.\nSo far, Aub rey had not had the opportunity to study L0rd The character of Ru lhvcn, and now he found, tot, although much more of his acions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his eoriductl. His companion was protruded in his liberality; — the idlc, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more tban enough to relieve their imminetic desires. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that he was not insurmountable the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the sick waitanl euen vpon virtue, that he granted his alms;—lbese were seized from the door of Tbe with sneezes barely removed; but when the prosligate came to ask something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink it up to 1 oep cr in his iniquity, ho was dismissed by rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, gcneral1y prcvalls about the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was only one thing about charity af bis Lardship, which was still mortified by its spirit: oll those on whom it was granted, inevitably fovnd tbat there wef a curse on it, for they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject miscry. In Brussels and in other cities through the whip they passed, Aubrey was surprised to appear eagerly wilh whilech his eomponion sought for Oll's counters in vice fashion; there he entered into all the tbe spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played successfully, cxcept where the best known was his Aritogonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but he wcls always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or sat him without chance of a nurnerous family; then his vory desire seemed the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was lajd, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the ha1f-mort mouse. In each towri, he left the old easy youth, torn up the circle in the head, cursed, iri lhe solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat sanllc, in the midst of the splattering appearances of children hungry for mule, without one end of his last immense wealth, where even with bruying sufficed to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take m0ney from the table of play; but immediately lost, at the ruirier of the rnany, the last gldor that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but it could result from a degree of certaln knowledge, whjch was not, however, able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to resign from this barbarity and pleasure which caused the ruin of all, the clnd did not have for his own benefit; — but he delayed it— for the same day, he hoped that his friend would give him the same opportunity to spoak-\nBut it happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke of the levets than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not get more gratific about him than the constant excitation of vainly wsbing to break this mystery, which to exalt the imagination began to assuage the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon buried themselves in Romo, and Aubrey lost time to see his companion; he left him every day sitting on the morning circle of an Italian countess, as he went in search of the mothers of another almost deserted city. Wbilst was thus erupted, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first was from Hjs's sister, breathing only the affliction; the others, from her guardians, amazed him; if he had before interested the imagination that there was evil power in his companjori, these feigns gave him sufficient reason for belief. His guards irisisted on his immediate lea...\nvirig his friend, and urged, that his sanctity was terribly vicious, for the possession of an irresistible power of seduction, made his fiendious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulterer had not been born of his character; but he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratificatiori, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, be driven from the pinacea of unwelcome virtue, to the western abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the femas that had been sought, apparent to their virtue, had, since his departure, cast the mask itself, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their victims to the public gaze.\nAubrey dissuaded leaving one character who rioted but showed a single bright spot a whieh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon him together, to purge, in the sense, to look at him more obscenely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lody's daughter, who was weakening above all. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; so he was forced to keep bjs plclns iri secret; but Aubrey's eye followed hiin in all its windings, and soon discovered that the ari assignment had been pointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Without lime, he entered Lord Ruthveri's apartment, and abruptly asked Bim his intentions with respect to the lady, lnformlng to him at the same tlme as he was aw are to his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions of the bis were such that he assumed all that you would have had on such a casual; and after being in a hurry if he wanted to marry him, was content with laughing. Aubrey withdrew, and, immediately writing a note, to say that from that moment he must refuse to accompany his Lordshlp in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mmolher of the lody, the jnform of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. Tbe's assignment has been prepared. Lord Ruthven the following day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a solation; 6ut did not hjnt any suspicion of his havirig plan was thwarted by Aubrey's jnterposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Tbe peninsula, sounding in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on mounts which apparently, shameful to frighten the acts of the free only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she formed the modcl for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed's paradise, except tbat her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that it might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the pinain, or trippod along the side of the mountain, a wovld thought the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanced her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for the luxurious aspect lhatsleepy of theanjmal adapted but to the liho taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his fear after antiquities, and often the fiery girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmere, buzzing all the beautiful of his f0rm, floating as it was on the wind, to the one eagerly gclze of him, who forgot the letters that he had deciphered on a tablet erased cllmosl, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids would fall, as she flattered around, would expose in the ray of the sun of Tbe so delicately bright and quickly fade away, he might well excuse the oblivion of the anliquary, which allowed hjs mjnd to escape the very object that he had before thinking of the vital importer to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousanias. But why try to describe charms that any fcel, hut no one can appreciate?—It was innocent, youthful and beautiful, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating rooms. While hedrew stayed for a memorial for her future hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes at her place of origin; she would then describe to her the waxing dance on the open plain, painted to him in all the gIowing colors of youngfu1 menory, the marriage pump she remembered having seen in her infoncement; and then, turning to the evil subjects made a greater impression on her mlnd, told her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her sincerity and apparent belief in what she was telling, exciled the irilest eueri of Aubrey; and she often told at hjm the story of the living varpyr, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and of the dearest tios, forced each yeclr, feeding the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the next manths, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe vilified her with the dwarfs of old men, who had at last dictated a life among them, after many of their close arid children had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fjend; and when she made him hear so unbelieving, she begged him to believe that she, sor, had been, noticed, that the thosc that horded their existence, had always had given evidence, which forced him to confess and to break his heart. Sbe detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his boundor was increased, hearing a precise prelty deserption of the Lord Rutbven; however, he still persisted Jri the porsuading, that lerc could not be any truth in his fears, tuangb at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to oxcite cl bclief intho supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to attach him more and more to Ianthe; his inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he sought his vision of romance, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, he found himself increasingly attached to the almost magical forin before him. At times he was tearing himself from her, arid, forming a plan for an antiqvarian resurgence, he went away, decided not to return until her object was amalgamated; but he still found it impossible to fix his attentori on the ruiris around bim, while in his mjnd he kept a shot image seemed alorie to the rigid possessor of his ghts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and always was the healthy childish francilc being that he had known the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him, but she did so because she no longer had anyone with whom she could afford favorite hclunts, while her tutor was busyjd ln sketch or burying a fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of Vampyres, they both, with several preserit, confirmed their ex isterice, pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to pursue on an af his excursians, who had to hold him for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him to riot your turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever remaln, after the day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of vampy res in their night orgies, and bare the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of Thelr representatioris, and tried to laugh at theidea's laughter; but when he saw the infancy shudder at his audacity to mock a punctual, infernal powcr, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his vnawaited excursion; he was surprised to serve the melancholy face of his host, and was worried to find his words, mocking the blief of these horriblc afflictions, had inspired them to such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his breast, and earnestly begged him to come back, and by the night passed the power of these berigs was put into actelon;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the day-Iight would end so, and that in the horlzon there was one of the tase spots which, in the warmer cljmates, quickly got into a tremble mass, and shed their rage on consecrated tbe c0untry.—He finally counted his horse, however, determined lo moke up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates...\nhe, is almost known; immediately1y the sunset, the night begins: and he had advanced far, tbe power of tbe st0rm was above — his thundering echoes had barely a resting inlervalent — his heavy heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seems to fall radial clrid at his very feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with speed dredged through the entangled forest. Finally, the arimal, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that he huddled in the vicinity of a hoof that rose from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrate, be approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city of Tobe, or at least trust to get shelter from the storm pellirig. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shouts of a woman who mixed herself with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laughter, continued to hear the sound almost intact; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden erasure, shook the door of the hut. He found himself in the darkness: sound, hasever, guided hlm. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, until the contagious sounds, ondrio rioted from him. He found himself in corruption with an ori, which he immediately got drunk; when a voice cried out: \"Again basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt struck by the one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and thrown with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on him, and threw himself on his breech, had put his hedges high in his throat — when the light of mary torches penetrating through the h0le which gave light in the day, the trouble;— to be instantly dared, and, the prey, rushed through the door, and into a mother the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were without. They entered; the light of the torches of tbeir fell on the walls of mud, arid tbe thatched washed on each individual straw with heavy saot flakos. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had drawn him to his cry; he was ogairi for fear of being in the darkness; but what was his stalker, when the blade of the torches burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corsus of lifels. He closed his eyes, hoping that he was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, stretched out at his side. There was no colour on the cheek, not even on his lip; yet, the thero was a silence on his face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived here: — on his neck and chest was blood, and vp0n his throclt were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously1ystruok with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litler was qvlckly formed, clnd Aubrey was placed next to the hcr who was recently to him the subject of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now fermented with the defect of life that had died in her. He didn't know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and ignited to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacation, he held almost unconsciousIy in his hand a bare dagger of a pcltricular consluction, qujch had been four in the cabin. They were quickly met by different wbo parties had been involved in the search for her that an annuitant had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, pushed the parents of a draconian cataslrophe. \"Décrire le gricf would be impossible; but when TBey lost the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable, both djed br0kcn-heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and wclf often delirious; in these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthc—by s0rne unaccouritabIe combination he seemed to be begging his training companion to spare the being he loved. At the time, he impregnated maldices on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from the wbatever motif, screaming from the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant assistant. Wben the latter recovered from his delirium, he was h0rrified on the start1d in the sight of the one whose image he now hid combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impliedirigaThe greatest repentance for the fault thclt had caused their exasperation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with bis presenco. His seigneury seemed quite carige; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew again into the lazy state of mind, and Aubrey pierceivcd no difference from the old man, excepl than at timos he was surprised to meet hjs ga2e fixed intensely hlm, with a smile of malicious exultatiori playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smjle haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was anxiously committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling brceze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elostia of the spirit that once had so djstinguished it now seemed to him to have frighted forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his spirit could not find him in the district of Atbons; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the district of Atbons, his 1-ighl stpp seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly he turned the rougir, showing himself, to his wild imagination, his foe paIo and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, each of which shine created such bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he was stunned by the mowing care he had taken badly from him during his life, which the parts of Groece had not yet seen. They searched in every direction, and searched for every place to which a memory could be attached; but so they bathed from one point to another, but they seemed rioting to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which were in fact the iritation of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the thofe generosity they defended against the so-called dangerf. As a result of neglecting the advice of the jnhabitans, they traveled with only a few guards, moro lo served as a guide and as a defense. On entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the precipices nelghbouring, had reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly any party engaged in a narrow collar, when they were bewildered by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by the ratio echoed with sevrol rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a mummcnt behind the tower of cover of the defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with insati It Cree bye tbem advances, arid heating exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should climb up and take the cm to the back, they decided once set forward in the scarf of the enernia. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthveri received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to be asphyxiated; and, without worrying about evil or his own peril, he was soon surprised by shaking the brigands' saces around him — the guards of Hjs havlng, up0n Lord Ruthven being wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they simply kept the trance until their c0mradc blushed with the promised sum, for which he had an organ. Lord Ruthven's strength decreased considerably; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with rushed tumults. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the objects surrounding him: but towards tho closto of last night, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, what was it that he was to quench the help with more bitterness than usual—\"Assist me! I do not interfere with my life, I observe the death of my exislorice as a day of flight; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I could have done anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need but I need — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you want to conoeal everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — on whether my death was unknown for some time in Eriglclnd—I—but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear!\" cried the man dying, rising up with exultant violence, \"say ye that for a year and a day ye shall not pass on your knowledge of my crimes or delights to every living being in arduous manner, whatever happens, or what ye see not. \"His eyes seemed to be blushing with these socks: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, laughing, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; the many scholars who attended to his knowledge of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shiuering came upon him, as if prefentirnenl of horrific omething were waiting for him. Arise early in the morning, he is about to enter the boveI iri whincb that he had left the corpse, when Arobber met him, arid made him say that it was no longer threshing, bavjng was transported by himself and the comrades, on hjs retjring, for tbe pinacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that Thcy had given to his seigneury, tbat he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey was surprised, and hit several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot where he was. But, wbon he had ascended to the light he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, the thinkho thieves sworn that they indicated the identical rock on which they put the body of Tbe. For a spirit of fire bis was perplexed, but he finally fled, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a stream in which he had encountered such tortjble misf0rtunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for the t0nvey to him your Otrarito, or in Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of the pipe he had given him to extend to Lard Ruthven. Among the other cases, there have been several cases of offences, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggcrs and ataghans. If one looks at their curious forms, the whale was surprised to find a shoathap apparently eaten in the sclme style while the dagger djscovered in the fatal hut—he murmured—takes the proof of the gajn surther, the faunted tbe weapon, clings to his horror can be imagined when he dispossessed that she made, although specially shaped, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; to bumble the particular shape, the different shades of the healthy on the haft and the kealh werc as well as spleridaur on both, and not to leave no rooin without doubt; there were drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady who had been tried to capture Lord Rulhven's seductive arts. Her parents found themselves in distress, the thorium was ruined, and she had not been heard since her seigneury broke apart. Aubrey's mind almost broke under so many repeotcd borbors; he was afraid that this lady had caused a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became inorose and silent; arid his only occupation was to bury the speed of the postilions, as if he were goirig to save the life of someone he loved. He arrived in Calais; a bree2e, who seemed to obey his will, soon made a call to the English shorcs; and he hastened to the manslan of his fat fat, arid there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the herbrace and caresses of his sisler, all memory of the past. If previously, by infantine ber caresses, she had acquired the bis effect, now that the waman began to appear, she was more attached as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey did not have this wjnning grace that wins the look and applause of the assemblies of the drawer room. There was none of this lightness that exists over 1y in the heated almosphere 0f a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never raised by the leujty of the mind below. There was a cbarm melancholy on this subject which did not seem to be born of malfartune, bvt brake s0meeling into, thal appeared to indicate o sovl conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could hang, it was sedative and pensive. Wben ol0ne, her face is lightened by the smile of j0y; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence those claws that she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged the horrible smile for the oluplar's one? It seemed that those eyes,—that face then played in full light of the Jr's own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it was thought that by her guardians mare made tbat her presentction should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now decided that the next show, which was approaching the most, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey wouIdrather stayed in his fathers' house, and fed on melancholy wbich dominated him. He could not feel intimidated by the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mjnd hod was so torn by the event that he had witnessed; but he discouraged sacrifice of his own comfort to the prection of his sister. They soon came to Lown, and prepared for Tbe the next day, which had been anriovnced as a drawing-r0om.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had been held rioting for a long timo, and all who were impatient with bask jn the kingship smile, hastened there. Aub Rey was there with his sister. While he was sinking into a corner by himselfIf, without taking into account everything around him, iri the memory of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that same place there--he himself--self--self---remember your oath. He was barely...\nage to tvrn, fearing to see a spectrum that would explode it, which he picinated, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn his opinion on this place vpon his first entry into the soeiety. He looked until his limbs almost saw him carrying their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into bjs carriage, and was a house driver. He trampled the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands bis on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would faint from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began to dreadfvl arroy — the dagger — his oath.—He woke up, cannot believe it — death rises again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore discouraged going aga into society; for although he tried to ask if it was Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few laughs later with his sister to try the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving his wife the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many of them were greedy, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister enraged by many, apprehensively in a carnetic conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he had the most horror. And he went forth, and put on his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her toward the street; and at the door, he found himself hindered by full-bodied osservants waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, hc heard this voice murmuring with him again: «Remember your oath!»\"He dared not turn, but, rushing over, soon grated to the house.\nAubrey almost got dislocated. If, before his mind was absorbed 6y a sub-jeot, how much more complete...\nThe certainty of the monster's life has continued to grow on the bl thovghts. Her sisler's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what led to her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and Ihose terrified him. The gold he bought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him; — was it then to roll this monster, carrying his breath upside down, in the midst of all that he was holding up, and not to abort his pr0gress? Maybe his sister was weary by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he rebukes, had already been mocked. For days he remained in the state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, that there were eyes full of tears, begging Him, for his good, to sustain nature. Lost, no capablc Ionger of darkness and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from street to street, anxious to steal the thal image that haunted him. His dress has become ncglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to midday fun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening at tho h0use; but at last he laid him down to rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxjous for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disconcerted by him who fled from a chaser-thari any—from thovght. His conduct, however, changed svddenly. Struck by the idea that he rented all his friends, with a proud among them, by his abseno, of a wbose presence that they were unconscious, he determined again in society, and looked at him closedly, anxjous to predict, despite his oath, al1 that Lord Ruthuen approached with intimacy. But if he entered a room, his discontented eyes were so strikjng, his inner trembling so incomprehensible, his sister was obsessed for the last time to beg lo abslain to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, in truth, the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to jnterpose, and, fearing that his mind was engulfing alienatcd, however, they have time to refute again that confidence that had risen before imposing on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirovs to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered in his wclriderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these mclrks af what they corisider madness, they hired a doctor t0 resident in the house, and constantly take oare of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency was so great that he was confined to his hammock. There, it was often 1 ie for days, unstickable to be shaved. He had become emaciated, his eyes hod reached a glazed chandelier;—Ibe only sign of affection and memories remained shown from the rushes at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that grieved him, he deceived her so as not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love is far from me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was talking to, her only ariswer wos, \"Truly! True!\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: gradual, howevor, over the course of the year, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw osf a part of his gl0om, while his guards observed, that several shots in the day he wovld colunl upori his fingers a certain numbness, and the smile lhen.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, a hls guardian bone entering his room, beg a doctor to converse wilh bis about the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's being in so horrible a situatiori, when his sister was g0ing the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was instantly drawn; he asked the...\nWho's that? Glad that this brand came back as indelect, from whlch they saw behad 6een private, they mentioned the name of Count os Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by his expression of his intonation to be pre-\nsent to the nuptials, arid desjring to see his sister. They did not answer, but in some nuts his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brevity, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive for tbe feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and arduous accomplishment; when suddenly to be Pereived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise saw the characteristics of the monster that had so long influenced his life. Hesei2 made the portrait in a cleavage paroxysm, and trampled him under his feet. In asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he threw as if he did not understand her, then took hold of her hclnds, and looked at her with a frantic expressi0n of face, he made her swear that she would never marry that moron, far from being — but he could not accuse him — it seemed that this voice had again hurt her to remember hls o ath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the arid doctor tho guardiclns, who had heard the whale, and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and forced her from Miss Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees yours, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, fond of the madness they imagined, took possession...\nIon of his spirit, cndeauoured to plcify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refvsod with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood to him the cause of this; but when he learned that he was considered infallible, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be exempted from those among whom he had heard. He hastened to evoke his former companion, and, by constant constancy, and the pretension of great affection for him and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and things to be met—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with those whom he addressed to himself;—could know how, if he knew her, her existence, bad begun lo seems worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could ljsten to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the integer of the Serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. As the title of the elder branch fell at length to hjm, he forgot an embassy of importarit, which served as an excuse sor ha stretching the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAuhrey, when left by the pbysician and his guardians, tried to bribe his servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he put himself in the honor of a letterer to his slster, corrupting the ber, as if one valued his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once held in their arms as their arid hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marjage, on which the heaviest curses were denounced. The servants promlsed thcy would deliver it; but giving it to the doctor, he preferred no longer harassing Miss Aubrey's mind by, what he oorifidercd, greasing of a mariaque. The night assailed without rest to the occupied inrnates of the houso; clnd Aubrey heard, with a trot of horror can more easily be designed thari describcd, the notes of occupied preparatian. Mornjng came, and the sound of cartage broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in frantic almosl. Finally, the nurturing of the servants overcame vigilance, they graduated the abandonment, leaving hiin in the custody of an old impotent woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and at the moment found hjmself in the apartmont where all wero almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive bim: bc immediately approached, and, taking arms by force, hurled from the room, speechless with fury. Wben on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if she is not my fiancée today, your sister is djshoriourized. The Wornen are fragile!\" He said, \"He threw him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek him.\" Au6rey could no longer provide for him; his rage, not finding ventilation, had braked a blood vessel, and he was transformed into a bed. It was not a rnetion for his sister, who was not present at his entrance, because the doctor feared to shake him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and the hridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness has worsened; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He disdained his sister's guardians, and on the evening of midnight he had struck, told in a composite way what the reader could peruscd, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; bul wben they arrived, he wcls too 1ale. L0th Ruthven had disapproved, and Au6rey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT DF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was set in motion by him, where to choose hjs place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN A sail across the Greek archipelago, on the edge of one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of this nclme. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found, force many British ships to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums fully reimburse the deviation of a voyage. Wo landed, as usual, at the bay jacket, and the men began to water, and they negotiated with the natives, the ecclesiastical, and myself, walking on the cave of the Homer school, and on the othcr, where we had already had the opportunity. On the front of Mouril Ida (a small monticulo so named) we met and erected a young Grcek as our guide, who told us that he had come to fronder Scio with a Lord Englifh, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot, said the Greek, and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mjtylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and hc left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, tbe wine-trader, six hundred zechins for him, (about L25o Englisb coin,) and rcside thore aboul fourteeri month, although nol constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the various islands.\"\nThe Tbis account has excited us very much, and we have not wasted time hastening the house where our bad c0untryman was residing. We were kindly received by an old inon, who led us to the mansi0n. It consisted of four apartments on the first floor: a room of eritrice, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spoky closet annexed. They are all simply decorated: green-green waltzes, marble tablays on either side, a myrtle of barley in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play your game through the brariches by moving a six-point source on the side of a small bro nze Venus in a lean posturo; a large sofa or sofa completes the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bo0k-cose: there were rio mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a piIllow, the common bed in all Greeeo. In the slttirig room, we observed a marble recreation, f0rmerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papcrs, which were then in a box of lclrge sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the cannons. On the lbo tablet of the insert rest Vo ltclire, Shakespeare, Boileav, and Rousscau complete works; Volney's R uins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German tho language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mjllon's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, prayed to Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press clt Constantinople, much torn, but no book in English of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with a brief of paper, on which cllso were remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The first lord read these books in the evening before he was told, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they had to go back there until his return; for it is so special, that if I moved onc thirig without order, he would frown me a week in a row; it is otherwise very good. I have once done a service; and I hate the product of this farm for the trophle of the lakjngcare of him, except for twenty zcchinis which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage iri the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianop1e; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the house was absolutely pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty inches long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and moss work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wcls c0vered by a fine Turkish carpet, under an awning of coarse strong lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surpassed, as on the cm the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evacning breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we buried the hovse, a small brook glidod oway, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered t0gether on the edges of the jls, and under the shade of two large 6ush blues, where marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we said, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, wiling, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old husband, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he was always attached to the church of the ovary twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what we might call \"a bird view.\" A line of rich viricyards led the eye to M0unt Calcla, covered with living trees and myrtlc in flowers, and on the svmmit, whose Greek temple of anticieritis appeared in the inajeftic decomposition. A small stream that came out of the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the m0untain bose. The sea of Tho smooth as glass, on a horizon not swept by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the lefl, through a view of lofty ehesnvt and palm trees, several smclll islands were observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldam enjoyed a uiew more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the persori who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew hjs dwarf but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" exclaimed our conductor, \"could he say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" – \"And can't you be such an old sling?\" \"If I can,\" said ho, \"I don't dare.\" We had the time of riots for the Armenian, but upon our return t0 the city we learned several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had worn eight youngs when he was last on the island, and even daric with them at the wedding feast. Hc gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weavirig theses articles. He also bought a new boal for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testclmonts to children po0r. In short, it has appeared to us, from all that we have collocated, to have been a very eccentric and honed cabracter. A circumstance that we lcarnl, whip our old friend at the cottage deemed appropriate do not discuss. He had a very bcautifu1 daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought a piano-strong, and he himself had learned how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we expelled from the island of Mitylene of peace; our imaginations all about the rack, guossing that this rarnbler in Greece could be. He had money that it was emptyed: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark the particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in camp with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greeec, \"The indjvidual,\" he exclaimed, \"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trip on the Jsland of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene.\" We had then heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every page. We deeply regret that n0t baving has been more curious in our research at the tho cottage, but we have oonsolated our 1ves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a future day; but ine that day neuer return. I make this statement, believing that he is not uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his seigneury, which was grossly slandered. He was described as a urifeolising arrangement, deafened himself to humiliation, or contributed in some way to appease his pains, or to add to his plaidsuros. The foct is dioctically the roverse, as can be collected by plairily from these 1ttle anecdolos. All the finer feelings 0f tho heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have tbeir seated in his hosom. The ardour, sympathy, and sheerness seem to guide the actions of 1l hjs; and his wrath of madness is an additional reason to mark him as a being on the heart wbose The Halh religion has put his seal, and on whose head Benevalencc has cast his coat. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" by feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume an opinion to gjvo. The reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who decres iustily Himsclf before lhat terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his genius. Doing good in the dry, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and the conscjence of approval.\nTHE END\nGillct, Printer, Crown-c0url, Fleet-street.",
    "30": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE superstition on whieh this lclle is founded so very gcneral in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to bc comman: it did not extend, hawever, to the Greeks until they swelled the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only sjence the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming prcualent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if drunk in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonders, still existing, from the dead rising from lher tombs, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variance, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there were beliefs, tbat vampyres at night irritated a certain part of the blood of thoir victirns, which became emaciated, lost the strength of tbeir, and died quickly of convomptions; while these human wood suckers were fattening — and their venom became distended to such a state of repletion, bone to causo the blood to sink from clll the pasfages of the bodies of lheir, and even the pores themselves of their skin.\nIn the London Day, March 173z, is a curious and, in cases of curse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifm, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in the Hungory. It seems that, on an examination of the commander-in-chief of the place, the magistrates, posiliously and unanimously confirmed, that about five years earlier, a cerlain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been moored by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, by eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampyr, and rubbing himself at his 6lood. This prediction, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, on the statement of cl was mado, lbat four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the iris inhabitants who consulted their Hadagni, took the body of TB, and ring it (as it is assumed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting al mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they joined the usual remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, to whlchhe it is said that he scattered as sadly as if he had been alive. And they cut his head off, and burned his body, and cast the asbes into his cloud. The same measures were adopted with regard to the corses of people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that, in the case of turri, they would become agents on top of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vclrnpyrehimself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is relativated here, because it sees better suited to lluster the subject of the observations presenl than any other instance that could be produced. In many parls of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after the deatb, for an odious orime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only deigned to vampyrise, but ompled to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by family affection.—A suppositlon olluded t0 in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre fent, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; thenghastly haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all tby roce; tbere of lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of life; yet hate the banquet that performeth shall feed thy ivid corsus; thy victims, be they exhale, shall know the demori for their sire; As ye curse, lhucvrsing them, Thy flowers are wilted upon the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, The young boy, the best of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! Yel Thov puts an end to your task and marks the last tint of his cheek – the last spark of his eye, and the glassy gaze lost must viow Who freezes o'er they blue lifeless; Then with the hand without Halloween shail tears The braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when shorn Most tender disorder plcdge has been worn—But now is carried away by this Memoricll of your agony! And thy best blood shall flow; thy tooth of gnachirig, and thy lip of thug; and threshing at the tomb of tby sullen, Go, and wjth Gouls and Asrits rave, until the thcse in boundor shrinks awcly Of a more aocvred spectrum than they.\nSouthey baf also presented in his wild but magnificent poem of \"Tbalclba\", the vampyre c0rse of the good Arobian Onoiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpase to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But this curial riot is supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she was paurtrayed throughout the tole as a complete type of purlty and innocence. The uerclous Tournefort gives a long acemount in his journeys of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness ari; and Calmet, in bis great work on this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditional tales ilIustratative of his esfects, put down fortb some dissertations learned, overturning to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMclny curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and whoh rnay riow be concluded 6y simply remclrking, that if the Vampyre lerm is one in the most general acceleration, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in various ports of the warld: like Vrocol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a noblernan appeared to the various parties of the ton leaders, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He raised the mirth ar sounds, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the scout of the fairly only stirred his attention, so that he could by a lo0k quill, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this sense of fear could not explain that he was getting up: some attributed him to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the core of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a single glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities made Hiin invited to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, attaching now the weight of boredom, carried happy to havirig something in thoir presenee able to engage their attentiveness. Despite the dead tint of the face, which never won a warmer ti nte, either from the buffoon of the m0destinity, or from the strong emotion of passion, kill its shape and the oullinc were beautifullfu1, many more nottied female hunters tried to gain his attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they migrated to term of affection: Lody Mercer, who was badly the trick of every m0nster in the drawing rooms since his marriage, threw himself in his way, arid did everything but pvt on the dress of cl montebonk, to attract his attention:—heavy in vain:—when she slipped in front of him, although her eycf was apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were not seen;—even her unapplied impudence was low, and she raised the field. But although common adultery could never influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the semel sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to his virtuous wife and iriocente daughter, few knew that he was ever speaking to himself t0 fcmales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and that it was that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were inoved by his clpparenl hatred of vice, he was also often among these women wbo forms the boast of their sex of their dome--\nthe virtues tick, as among those who push them through the vlces of drinking.\nA6ovt the same time, he came to London a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with one sister in the p0session of great wealth, by parents who died while he was in eternity. Left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they blamed the most important charge of his mind in the custody of the sub-alturns mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, a sense of honor and frankness high romantic, which every day ruin so many milliners of clpprentlces. He believed to sympathize with the virtuo, and he thought that the Uicc waf thrown by Providence simply for picturesque effeot tip of the scene, as seen in the romances: he thought that the miferie of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of eliothes, which were like the worm, but which were better suited to the eye of the animeux by their irreguable folds and various colored patbes. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dream was the realities of life. Ho was beautiful, devious and rich; for these fools, when he entered gay circles, many others surrounded him, strivlng whjch would describe with the least truth their languishing or blushing savoriles: the girl at the same time, enlightening the counterials as hc approached, and 6y thoir with sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false nolons of his talents and his mority. Attached as hc was to the romance of his solitary hours, he wos st artled to find, shot, except in the candles of tallow and wax that slipped, born of the presence of a ghost, but srom lacks snufflng, thcre was not the basis in real life for any of these congreries of photos and descriptions of plisiririg contained in lhose v0lumes, from which he had formed his study. By finding, however, some compensation in its gratified variety, it was abovt to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary behavior we have above disordered, made him pass into the career of hjs.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the cbclracter of an entiroly man absorbed in hese1f, which gave little sigrian othcr of his obsorvation of external objects, that tacit assent to the existence of tbeir, implicitly by tbe aojdance of their contact: allowing his iinogination to imagine e very tbing that flattered c propensity to extirvagant ideas, he soan formed this object in tho hero af a rornance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fantasy, rather lhan the person in front of him. He has become familiar with him, calmed his attention, and so far has advanced on his opinion, that the presence bis was always recognized. He gradually suggested that Lord Ruthven's business was embarrassed, and soon discovered that he was about to travel. Desiring to win a certain computeriori respecting this singular character, which, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for bim to make the tour, which for the bridegroom generations low 6een believed necessary to allow the young to take some fast pieps in the care of vice-lowards setting up an equality with the elderly, and rioting a1lowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, when intrigues scondals are begden as subjects like plisclntry or praise, according to the degree of competence he had in the realization of these ones. They consented; and Aubrey immediately mingled with his intentions with Lord Rvthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently had nothing in common with the othor men, he readily accelerated it, and in a few days thcy had passed the surrounding waters.\nHlthcrlo, Aubrey had no contribution to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the rcsults offered different conclusions from the apparent reasons for conduct bis. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, regenerated with the hand bis plus lhan enougb ta relieve their immediate needs. Bul Aubrey could not help but point out that it was a riot on a uirtuous tbe, reduced to judigence by the missorlones, even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to make his desires ring, bul to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniqujty, he was sent away with rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which comes grievingly on the bashsu1ness retreat of the virtuous needy. Tberc wos ane circumstances about the charity of her Lordship, whjch was even more impressed on her mind: al1 those upan that it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because tbey were all led to the scaffold, ouvnk to the lowest and most abiect misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the appearance with which his companion sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always with suoces, except where the best known was in the throes of his antagonist, and then he losl even more than he spoiled; but it was always with the changing face of the samo vn, that he usually dragged society: it was however a riot, so much so that he discovered the eruption young fu1 nouice, or the unlucky father of a large number of fami1y; theri his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent clbstractivity of the spirit was a help apart, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city he left an easy youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, in the folly of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him withir the reach of this fiond; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of mvte hunger chlldren, without a sirigle farlhing of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to sit-\nThat is why we have decided to go further. He does not look like money from the game table of Tbe; but irnmediatley lost, t0 the ruiner of many, the last gjldor he had just pulled from convulsive tbe the take of the innocent: this could but be the reverence of a certain knowledge agreement, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Avbrey often wanted you to represent him to his sling, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the rvin of all, and did not make his own profit; — but he dilated it — for every day he kissed a friend bis gave him an opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; to bow, it never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car laughs, and amjdst the wild variety and rich scenes af nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained na gre ater gratificatian of it than the constant excitation of vainly wishing to break lhatmystery, which to his imaginative exaltity began to tighten the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, along Aubrey for a lost tjme sigh of his companion; leaving him in a gentle presence on the snoring circle with an Italian ointment, if he went in search of the memorials of the deserted city of Anothcr almosl. While he was thus engagcd, letters came snoring England, that he opened the impatience of the witbeoger; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the otbers were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had previously engaged in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insist on his immediacy leaving his friend, ond urged, that his character was terribly viciovs, because the possession of irresistible powers bones seduction, made his false habits rhorrer dangerous to silk. It had been discovered that his contempt for the advltress had not arisen in the hatred of the hcr character; but that he had demanded, in spite of his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, had raised himself from the pinnacle of the uriculate uritus, to the lowest abyss of the infamous arid degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of the virtue of the air, had, finished his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the decformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAu6rey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single right p0int on wbich to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a precious pretext for abandoning him completely, by seeking, by means of it, to monitor him more closely, and not to allow any light circumstances to pass. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that bls Lordship was trying to work on the inexpericnco of the daughter of the lady whose house ho chicfly frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was forced to wear his planf in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been applied, whlch would most end the ruin of innocent Ari, though tiny girl. Not losing timo, entered Lord Ruthven's apartmnt, and earnestly asked her with respect to the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven opposed his internions, which he all believed to have on such an occasion, and after being prostrated if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say that, from tbat mummerit, he must dec...\nBy accompanying her Lordship in the remajnder of their proposed visit, he ordered her sergeant to look for apartments, and called the lady's mother, lnformé hor of everyone knew, riot only with regard to her davghter, but also concerning the ch aracter of her L0rdsbip. The assignment of the wcls prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to riot his complete consent to a separation; but did not imply that he suspected that his plans had been defiled by the interp0sition of Aubrey.\nHavlng left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed the residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the erased documents 0f ancient glory on the monumerites which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of the free only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many cursed lichens. Under the same roof, there was a being, so beautiful and so delicate, who had formed the model f0r a painter wanting to spread on canvas the promised hope of faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit so that one could think that she could belong to lhose who had no faults. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the moritaine, we would have the gazelle a poor kind of its beauties; for who wovld exchanged the eye ber, apparently the eye of the animated nature, the luxurious storm the drowsiness aspect of the suitable animal but to taste af an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for aster antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit tbe af a Kasbmcre hutterfly, brandished all the beauty af his shape, flaling as he was on the wind, for ga2e avid to him, who forgot the letters he had just decrypted on a tablet alin0st effaced, in contemplation of his sylph-like figure. Many of her braids would fall, as she flirted around, would expose in the ray of the sun so bright deljcately and quickly erase Hucs, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who escape sr0mhis theoretical object spirit that he had before thinking of the vital imp0rtance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt wby tries to describe the charms that everyone feels, no-one can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, arid beauty, vaunted by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating the ball. He drew remains of tbose which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, sho wovld stood by, and wclteh the magic effect of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe to him the dance circling upan the plain operari, wou1d painting, to him in all the flamboyant colaurs of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage which she remembered to look in her irony; ond then, turning to thal subjects had evjderitly mado a greater iinpression on ber mirid, would leave him all the surnatvral tales of his nurse. And often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the dearest tlcs, before each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her by so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, wbobad ot dctcated one living clmongself, after several of their relatives relcltive and children had found Markod with tbe sta mp 0f he fiends appetite; and when sho found him so unbelievable, she was begged to believe herself, for he had been, romarcqué, that those who had darod to question their existence, always bad some evidence given, and that he forced them, with grief and heh, the blindness was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid bis borror was incrusted, by the pillowrig a rather precise descrjption of the Lord Rulhven; however, he again harassed by persuading her, tal there could not be truth in his fears, although at the same shot he wondered about the many coincidences that all tended to excite a belio in the adrenal power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected by the clmong of the women he had sought for the hjs vision of romance, gained his heart bis; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a uriated Greek girl, he still found luscSi more and more attached to the almost fai ry form before hiin. He sometimes ripped hlmsel, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, decided not to return until his ohiect was reached; but to be always found it is impossible to fix his attcntjon vpon the ruins the arourid, wbilst in his mind he kept an image that seemed alone the good possessor 0f bis thoughtf. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could screw her favorite haunts, while her guardian was occppied in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped from the destructive hand of tiine. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, engaged they bollh, wilh several present, confirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey determined t0 to make one or his excursions, which had to hold bim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, wbere no Greek would ever stay, clster the day had closed, vpon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in the night orgies of lheir, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on him wbo darcdto crossing their way. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring tbus to mock a supcrier, an infernal power, he very named whose clappargent chewed their blood wiped, to be silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excursiori unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was designed to see that his words, motivating the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such a tcror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, arid seriously begged him back, the night was allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he saw that the light of the day was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warm climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted country.—He finally, however, stripped up hif borse, determined lo to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. Twiligbt, in the southern climates, is almost naked; immediately the sun sets, the nigbt begins: and he had already advanoed far, the power of the storm was above — his lubricated echo had barely a resting interval — his heavy heavy rain forced his woy through the foliage of lacanopyjng, while the forked blue lightning shone to fall and radlate at his own feet. Suddenly, his horse scared, and he carried with terrible speed through the tangled forest. The animal at 1asl, through fatigve, stopped, arid, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that did not rise from the masses of dead lecves and brushwood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least rely on getting shelter on the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams that a woman mingled with suffocated mockery, exultating a lavgh, continued in an almost intact smile; —ho was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the daor of the hut to apcn. He found himself in total darkness: tbe s0und, however, guided him. He was apparently unaware of it, because, although he called, the sounds were still contrived, and no opinion was taken of him. He found blmse1f iri contact with someone, whom he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out: \"Again baffled!\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught hy whose strength is seenmod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, hc wrestled; but he was in vain: he was lifted from hls seen and thrown with a huge force agajnst the ground: — his enemy threw hjm himself on him, held on his knees on his chest, had placed hls hands at the top of his throat — when the glare 0f many torches penetrating through the ho1e which gave light in the day, shook him; — he had incorruptibly risen, arid, leaving his prey, precipitated by the door, and in a mumcnt the crushing of the branches, as he broke tbr0ugh lbe wood, had no longer heard. The storm was now silt; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatch of the tob loaded on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. In the desire of Avbrey, they sought her, who had caught her, her cries; he was again left in darkness; 6and what was her horror, when the light made her once more to push the torches, to perpetrate the aerial form of her beautiful conductor, brought a corse without life. He shouted his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose fr0m his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he swallowed them, stretching by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was an abovt ber face that seemed almost as attached as the thal of life that once lived there: — on his neck and braisl wcls blood, and on his throat were the marks of tceth having opened tho vein: — to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A Vompyre!\" A litter was quickly bewitched, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of visions so mary and so brilliant, now fallen with the flower of the Iife that was bad died in her. He knew that he had not been beaten with bis — his mind was inflamed and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. Tbey were soori rnet by the various parties who had engaged in the search for her which the mother had missed. Their lamentations shouted, as they approached the city, they advanced the parerants of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be irreplaceable; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsc.\" They were inconsonable; both died in the heart of brokcn.\nAvbrey being put to bed was seized with a violent foam fever, and waf often deIirious; in the Lhesian inlorvals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by an unpleasant bo c0mbination seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. To other timos, he imprecises the curses on his head, the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Atheris, ond, for whatever reason, vpon audition of the slclte of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and begged his constant attendant. When he recovered from his deljrium, he was borrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image is now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving alinosta repentonce for the sin tbat had used their separation, and slill morc by the attentiori, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence bis. His seigneury seems completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic belng who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence threatened to be repatriated, he gradually withdrew to the same state of indind, and Avbrey did not pierce any difference from the former man, except that he was sometimes in fury to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation p1aying on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Driving the last stage of the recovery of the irivalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves without tidal rasod 6y the cooIing breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the sun without movcless;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this sho ck, was much troubled, arid this elasticity of mind that the evil ancestor so distinguished today seemed to run away. He was now as in love with solitude and solitude as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athenf; if he sighed him in the midst of the ruins which he had once fried, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he would lock him in the woods of Tbe, his slight step would seem wandering in the middle of the underwood, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, to his wild imagination, his pale and frantically fervent face, he smiled on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, all the seams of which crecltcd so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held him bound by the tender heart ho had taken from him during his misfortunes, that they fled the parts of Greeoe or hcld still seen. They traveled in all directions, ond looked for all the places where a rocolion could be attached; but they rushed from one place to another, but they did not let themselves listen to what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of not taking into account the advice of the inhabitants, one occasioniori they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than defense. When entering, however, in a narrow layer, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks scrambled by the prccipices of the area, they had reason to repent of their religligence; for hardly the whole party entered the narrow pass, when TBey was surprised by the whistle balls af near their head, and by the cchoed ratio of several cannons. In such a situation, their gvards had left them, and, standing behind rocks, they had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. L0rd Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating the example of Thoir, withdrew for a mother behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but assailed to be so detained by an enemy, wbo with insulting cries made them advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers shoovId grimpab0ve and take them back, they decided in fact to rvsh forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot from the shoulder iri, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, without long concern for the contest or his peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his Havjng guards, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately conned Jr's arms.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged the redhead to convince his friend wovnd to a nearby cabrin; and, having accepted a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were merely coritenl to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had ordered ari. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed.\ned; he scemed af unconsciovs of pain as he had been objects tho aboul him: bvt towards the closure of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with more than usual solicitude—\"Help me! You can love me — you can do more than that — I don't remember my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the day of pafsing; but you can save my boor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need little, I can't explain the whole, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free from stajn in the mouth of the world, and if my death disappoints a little lime in England, I—but lift it. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising up violently, \"Swear by the mad soul, by all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to the livirig ariy being in any way, what can happen, or what you can see. \"His eyes seemed to be bursting with Ihère's socks: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he lay one stroke on his pillow, and breathed no moro.\nAubrey retired for resl, but did not sleep; the circumstances rnany attending his accarirance with thjs husband rosc on his mind, and he knows n0t When he remembered that he was swearing that a cold frenzy was approaching the back, as if, from the prescntiment, something horrible were waiting for him. He got up early in the morning, and was unable to enter into the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief informed him that he was no longer there, having been passed on by himself to encumbered comrades, to his retreat, to the pinnaele of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, that he could be exposed to the first ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes more and more men, dissuades from going to bury him on the spot. But, when Ho had climbed to the top, he found no trace of body of Tbe or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the same rock on whom Tbey had laid the 6ody. For some time, his inind was stunned iri eonjeetures, but he finally returnedod, c0nuinçé that they had buricd thc body for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying, arid misfortunes in which all apparently conspired to increase this melancholy superstitlous who had grasped his mind, ho solved lo leave him, we soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vefsel t0 to transmit it to Otranto, or to Naples, is busy organizing the cffffects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthvcn. Among other things, there was a case containing several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were daggers and ataghclns. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, wbat was his surprise to find a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut – to be shuddered – hastening from gairi more proof, he faund thc gun, and his prostitute can be imclgined when he discovered thal he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his heel. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they saw looking to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to make malolieve; but the particular shape, the same shade variable on the haft and the sheath were similar in splendor on hoth, and left no room for doubt; here were also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his way back, in Rome, his first investigations coerced the lady whom he had tried to catch from L0rd Rutbven the feminizing clrls. His porents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under many cable horrors; he was afrclid thal this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and bounded; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, if he were to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wil1, soon set him on the shores of the Engl isb; ond ho hastened at the house of his fathcrs, and there, for an inoment, appeared to lofe, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If shc before, by her irifantious caresses, had gained her grip, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that gajnsthe gazec and the applcluse of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the cured otmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a charm me1anchovy about that that didn't seem to get up from misfo-\nbut of a certain sentimentirig inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a more brilliant kingdom. Its step does not have this light soot, whjch slrayf where 'cr a butterfly or a color can attracl—it was sedclte and pensive. When alone, her face was never brigled 6y with a smile of joy; bul wheri her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for volvptvary? It seemed that tbose eyes,—thclt saco were then playing jn the ligbt of the proper riative sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the wor1d, he had been thought by his guardians more fit than his prestigation should be delayed the return of a brother without liler from the continent, when he could be his practicator. It was now decided that the next show, which is approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"b usey scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the house of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that carried the bim. He could not appease interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfarl to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the city, and prepared for it the next day, which had been irritated as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a bad living room was not held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the flood of kingship hurried there. Aub Rey was there with his sisler. While he was standing in a rut by his sons, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the remorse that the first time he had seen Lord Rutbven was in that same place, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he caught up with tao, fovnded in his ear—\"Remove your oath.\" He had an arduous courage to turn, rescued from seeing a thal spectrum, he would explode it, when he perceived, at a little distanc, the same figure who had stirred his opinion or this place at the top of his first entry into the int0 society. He spoiled his limbs almost by refusing to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven h0me. He rushed into the room with tears pressed, and he threw hares on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would pass away from the braine. Lord Ruthuen again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — the ascent unleashed again! — He thought that his imagination had conjured the image on which his mlnd was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, letrof0rc, to return to the society inlo; for although he tried to ask Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed the information gclining. He cried a few nights later with his sister for lho assombly in a close relationship. Leaving him under the protection of a matron, he rotated inlo a reees, and he gave himself to his own devouting thoughts. Perceivlng, finally, whom many left, he woke up, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in serious canversaliori; he tried to pass and approach her, who one, whom he asked to move, tvrned around, and revealed to him these characteristics to be the most horror. And he went forth, and took hold of the arm of his sistor, arid, with a hurry, and forced her toward the street: and at the door of Tobe he snuck in the sons of the servants who were inflamed by their lords; and, if he were bound to pass over them, he heard again that the rogue murmured near him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but pressed his sister, soon reborn at his home.\nAubrey became very distracted. If, before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certitude of the monster's livirig has once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now meaningless, and it was in vain that she insulted her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more unbeliever he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he did, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been stained by him. But never, if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspects, who would lock him up? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death here had already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when Hifififter came, who, with his eyes flowing, begged Hiin, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, rinking longer able to 6rest calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal this imagc that haunted him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday smile as to the night's damps. He was not a danger to be recognized; he returned first with the house of the euening; but at last he put it to rest wherevcr fatigve exceeded him. Hjs sistor, concerned far from his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were removed by the hive that fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left by hjs all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to engage again in society, and wot ch bim closed1y, anxious to hurt, despite his oath, all those who Lord Ruthven approached privacy. But when he entered a ro0m, his distrustful and distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sjster was ultimately obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the pirated monstrosity, the gvardlans considered appropriate to interpose, arid, fearing that the mind would alienate themselves, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that had been imposed before them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to sow the hive of wounds and suffering, ho had met daily in his wariderings, and 0f prevent hiin from exposing to the general eye these wbat mclrks they considered madness, they directed a physlcian to reside in the house, and take care of him constanl. He hardly seemed to notice, so that the mind was completely absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency became so great in Lasl that he was confined to his room. That's where there was a few days ago, unhappily waking up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had kept a glazed chandelier; — the anesthetic sign of affection and respiration remained disp-\nHe sat down on his sister's entrance; then he started sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch HLM—the love of the rne's love is great, riots approach him!\" When, however, she enquires to whom he has recferred, her only answer was: \"Truly! True!\" And again he sarik in a state, from which he could not even shake. This lasted a lot of m0nths: grcldually, however, bone the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his glooin, while his guardians observed, that the episcs in the hc counl day on his fingers a defined number, and then fmile.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the Ycar, one of his guardians entering his room, begged a corific with his physian on melancholic tbe circumstanco to be Aubrey in such a terrible siluation, when his sister went the next day to his marriage. Auhrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked axlusly whom. Happy with his inark return from the intellect, whom they feared to be deprived of, they mentioned the riamc of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that ho had met in society, Aubrey seemed to plead, and astonished them even more by saying his intention of bo present to the nuptials, and wanting to soo his sifl-\nCr. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes hlssister wos with him. He was apparently again able to be afflicted by the influence of his beautiful flow; for he pressed her into his chest, and kjssed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowirig to the thought of his brother to be once again olive so that he could feel the effect. He 6egan to speak with all his wond warth, and to congratulate on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and all the achievements; when ho suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise at watching the traits of the monster who had so long influenced his ljfe. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and put it under the fool. On her asking Bim why to be so destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if hc did not understand it — then grabbing her hands ber, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of face, he told her sweater that she would never marry cem0nster, because he could not move forward—he scemed as if this voice bim rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem s s s s s s s s s s s s s\nthinking Lord Ruthven was close to him, but didn't see anyone. In the rneantime, the guards and the doctor, who had kept the whale, and thought it was only cl up from her disorder, entered, and Miss Aubrey's f0rcing, wanted to leave bim. He got on his knees, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the irisanity they imagined, had a laken position of his mind, were striving to pacify and withdraw.\nLord Ruthuen had called the aster mornirig the living room, and refused beeri wilh all the others. When he had the beard of Aubrey's ill health, he understood himself to be the cause of it; but wben he learned that he considered wcls crazy, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from these ainongs that he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his companion to sow, and, six years of alternance, and the pretension of the affectionate great ser the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had donners and loons to tell — could speak of himself as an individual os ari having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with his ta which he spoke to himself; — could say how, Sirice whom he knew, his existence had begun to seem wicked of presruation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents;— in firic, he knew so well how to ufter the ort of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, tal gained affections ber. The title of the elder branch which was long-failing, was obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage to the TB, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brothel,) which was held the same day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrcy, when left by the doctor of Tbe and his gvardjans, tried to brie the servos, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; they gave him a bim; he wrote a letter to his slster, wounding her, as she appreciated her happiness, her hanour and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once put her in their arms as the hope and hope of their holly, to delay this marriage for a few hours, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, hc thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mjnd any more by, what he considered, the bone raves a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can moro easily be conceived as descrjbed, notes of occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the sound of the wagons broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up aum0st frantic. The curiosity of Tbe's servants at the point overcame their vigilance, he gradually stopped, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. Ho seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, arid at a moment ring himself in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him out of the room, furious without blemish. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear on the slaircosis, \"Remember your oath, and know, if my wife is ever married, your sister is dishonored. The Wornen are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, under the influence of the old woman, had Carne in his dryer. Aubrey could no longer support his sons; his rage found no ventilating, had broken a blood vessel, and he was erupted in bed. This was not mentioned to his sisler, who was not presenl when he entered, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The wedding was solemnized, and the bride left London.\nAvbrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces TB symptoms near the approach to death. Hc wanted the guards of his sjster to be called, waved when midnight had struck, he relativizes in composite what the reader persisted—to have died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, jt was too late. Lord Ruthven had disapproved, and Aubrey's sister had slipped tho tbirst from a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYR0N RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Grcoins archipelago, aboard one of his Majesty's vescls, in the year 1812, we went to the port of Mitylene, iri the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supply of alwclys food and vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both men of war and merchants; and although he is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his bountiosamply repay for the deviatlon of a voyage. Wo disembarked; like usval, at the bottom of the bay, and wbilst the meri were used to water, and tbe shaker negotiated for cattlo with the natives, the clergy and myself taken a ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and ather places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we mix with and engage o young Greek as our guide, who told us that he came badly from Scio with an Eng1ishlord, wbo left the island four days before we arrived1 in his feluoca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" he said, \"and would have taken me with him; bvt I did not choose to leave you Mitylene, where I am likely to freeze rnarried. He was a weird man, but he was very good. Tbe cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechjnes for lt, (about Lz50 Engljsh currency,) and resided there around aigrec months, but not constantly; for he sails lri hjs feluccauery 0ften to the various islands.\"\nThis story excited our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time iri hclstening at home where our peasant had resided. We were pleased to receive an aldmcln, which directed against the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an enlarging room, a living room, a living room, a bedroom, an enclosed spaciaus closet. They were all decorated sumptuously: grace walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the ceriter, set in motion a small fountain brieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed spring jn on the side of a small Venus bronze ln a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. Iri's lobby stood on a dozen English cane chairs, and a book-ca emptys: there were no mirrors or paints. The litter had only one large mattress lying on the float, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a low pil, the common bed throughout Greece. In the reclamation room, we observed a marblc recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think 0urselves juslified in the exomining tbe contained. On the painting of the recreation of lcly Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and Rousseau the works are finished; Valney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germon language; Klopstock's Messioh; Kotzebve's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Lost's Paradise, an Ita-\nlian edition, printed in Parma in 18I0; some small pamphlets of the Groek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no eng1ish book of any descriptiori. Most of the baokssc were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Ilalian and Latin. Mossia was coastally soribbled garlic more, and marked with sheets of paper, ori whieh were also remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The first one had been read these books in the evening before being locked up, and forgot to put them with the others; but,\" he welded, \"there they transferred me to his relurn; for it is so parlicular, that I have been to move something with arders, he wouIfrow upori me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a sorcerer; and I did the work of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, the ox twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adriaticopia; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the hovse exlemally was pleasant. The portico forward waf fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and c0rnices work frets, (as it is riow cuftomary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The r0of, flooded by a light stone balustrado, was c0vered by a thin turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking iri, drinking light wines, sucb like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and irritating the evening breezo.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the house, a small stream runs away, grclp...\nhe, oranges and lindens gathered on his borders, and vnder the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with a back of arnamental wood wcls placed, on which we were t0Id, the lord passed many of his furnaces and neighbors up to twelve o'c1ock, readirig, write, and speak to hiinself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed that he might be very pious, and that he would always bind our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A line of rich vineyards looked at Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries iri blo0m, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in a majestic dooay. A small stream from the ruins of lhc descended into broken casades, it was Iost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the an horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in f ront; and a little to the left, through a uista of high palm trees of cbesnut clnd, small seueral islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a view more than I did; but our requests were unanswered as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: Norie knew his name but Dorninick, his banker, who had g0ne in Candia. \"The Arrenian,\" said our canon,\" he said, \"but I am sure he will not do it,\" he said, \"and can't you say it, my old friend?\" he said, \"if I do it,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our tour to the city we learned several details of the isolatodic lord. He had shared Elgbite girls that he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cowman, horses to others, arid silk of cotton to the girls who live by weaving these artlcles. Ho also bought a new boot away a wha fisherman had lost his own in a scab, and he osten gave Greek testanents to tho poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have collected, to have been a very eccentric character clnd benevolenl. A waxumstanco that we are bequeathing, which our old friend Aucottclge considered appropriate not to dissociate. He had a very valiant daughter, with whom the l0rd was afteren seen walkirig on the sea-part, and he had bought him a piano-strong, clnd taught him himself the use of this one.\nThis is the insormation with which we left the peaceful island af Mitylene; our imaginations all on tho rack, guessing who this rclrnbler in Greece would be. He had money he was euded: he had philantbropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular gonivs. When we arrived in Palermo, all our customs were dissipated. Falling company with Mr. FOSTER, the archbitec, a student of WYATT'S, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greoce, \"The indlviducll,\" he said, \"on whom in you are so anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met hiin in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I alsa vis-à-vis-vis-\n\"I told Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the famo of his lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Chjlde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every page. Deeply djd we regret not to have been more curious in our rescarches at the cottage, but we have consoled ourselves with the idca of relurning in Mitylene on a future day; hut to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, by helping him not quite uncomfortable, and in court in the good name of his lord, wbich was grossly slandered. He was described as an insensitive dispassion, contrary to the assailation of human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add his pleasures. The faet is directly the rovers, as inay clearly gathered srom these little anecdotes. All the keener feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tendernoss, sympathy and charity seem to guide all the actions of bis; and his courteousness of solitude rest is an additional reason to mark him as a being on which the heclrt religion has put the ber seal, and on whose head Benevolence Halh has cast hermantle. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" precedent without feeling proud of him as an emissary. By respecting his loves and pleasures, I do not assume the right to give my opinion. Relationships must always be greeted with caution, with portiosity, when they affect the skin integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify himself, that is to say, the horrific tribvnal in which all must cling, only can censor the wanderings of a dead-living person. Lord Byron'f charaeter is crazy about his genius. Doing madness in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Courl, Fleet Street.",
    "31": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polldorl\nTHE superftitlon on which his tale is based is very general jn the East. Among the Arabs, he seems to be a cominon: however, he did not explain himself to the Greeks until they afflicted the establishment of Christiclnity; and he took his form presounded only from the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it buried their terroire, he gradually increased, and f0rmed the subject of many wonderful stories, still excavated, of dead tbe rlsing from their tombs, and feeding on the hlood of young and beautiful tbe. In the West, it spread, with the same slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, that the belief existed, that the nigbtly uampyres soaked up some of the burden of their victims, who were moved, lost their strength, quickly perished from consumption; while these fattened hvman blood suckers—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, to the point of causing blood to escape from their pasfages, even pores from their skin.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is an eurious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which Js declared to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the chief magnard and the magistrates of the square, they were positive and unanimously affirmed, that, abovt five years earlier, a certaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassouia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been torried by cluampyre, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampire, and rubbing himself with blood of hjs. This precaution, however, prevented him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twerity or thirty days after death and burial of hjs, many people com-\nhe was tormented by him, and a statement was ransacked, beating four people had been deprived of reading hy his attclekf. To avoid other malice, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usval in cases of vampyrism) frcsh, and enlirely free of corruplion, and emit to the emovth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to a usual remedy. A pole was completely driven through Amold Pclul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alivo. Tbis did, they cut his head off, burned his body, und threw the ashes into the grave. The samc measvres werc adopted with the corses 0f those persorif wbo hod who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in their t urn, become begles on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre heseIf, and sucks in turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade ls hcre relativizes, asks it better suited to illustrate the subject of current observers than any other instance that could be added d. In many parts of Greece, it is entrusted as a kind of punishment after death, for the home of a heinous crime committed while in extortion, that the deceased is not only made for vampyris, but forced to limit his internal visits only to those who loved him most on earth, to whom ho was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A suppofition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBvt first on the earth, as Vampyre fent, thy horn shall be torn from its sepulchre; then haunt the native dish, and suck the blood of all thy wreath; there of thy dclughter, sister, wife, At midnight of a stream of life; yet forget the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are eyet exhaled, Sha1l knoweth the devil for their sire; As you curse, you curse larn, your ore flowers with...\nHe's on the stern. But he who, for your crime, is to be kindled, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a fclther: This word shall engulf your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his oheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who looks like his life without spot; then, with his hand without spot, will tear the braids of his hair, including, at first, a lock when the affection of the tenderest commitment has been warned—But now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! Yet with the best blaod of the thiary 0wn must flow; Your nibble tooth, and your slug; then rushing to your sullcn grave, Go-clend with the rave Gouls and Afrils, Tjll thesein bror brink far from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also presented in the hls wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampyre 0f the good Arabic Oneiza, which is represented cls having returned from the grave for the purpose It is the tormenter that is best washed when there is once. But this cannol is supposed to have led the sinvousness of the life of ber, shc being poured through the soul the quire of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracio nous Tournefort has long reported on his journeys of several aslonisbing cases of vampyrism, which he claims to have been a witnesf; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides the waariety of the arieodotes, and traditional illustrative narratives of his effee-\nts, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting information about this singularly horrific suporstition migbt can be added; although the present can resist the limits of a riot, unjustly devoted to explanatiori, and which may not be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use of mado in vclrious parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the midst of the accompanying dissipations, there was a London winter, similar to the small parts of tbc lead of the ton, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted the attention of the bis, tbat hc could by a glance calm him, and throw fear into these brea-\nms where thoughts reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain when it was disappearing: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce inside w0rkings over the beard; but fell on the spoon with a radius of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to the evory bouse; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the violent excitement, and now felt the misfortune of ennvi, were pleased to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In the epile of the mortal tint of her face, which took on a warmer tint, either in the buffoon of the rnodity, or in the strong emolion of passion, although its shape and the beautiful werrc contours, much of the femalc hunter after having tried to make known t0 h the attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery of all the shewn iri monsters from the drawing rooms since her death, threw himself in his way, and made all purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew her opinion:—although jn vain:—when she stood before him, tigb her eye was apparently fixed on her, again he stood as if they were vnpercejved;—even hor impudence inappalled was 6affled, and sbe left the field. Bul, although corn adultery could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it is not that the female sex was indifferent to hiin: but suoh was the apparent warning that he spoke to the vrucious wife and innocent davghter, that few knew to be had addressed to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it overcame the fear of his singular charaoter, or that they mocked at his apparent hatred of vlce, he was like countless among those feminists who make up the boast of their sex of domestic virtues toil, as shouting at those who jostling by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a gentleman of Aubrey's riam arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left in possession of a great wealth, by parerits that died while he was still in childhood. Left to him, too, by the Gvclrdians, who simply represented their duty to look after the fortune, while they abandoned the most burdensome burden of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated more bisinagination than his judgment. So he had this high novel...\nThis feeling of honor and frankness, which will ruin so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thovghl that the vice was lhrown in by Provideanoe simply for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in the novels: he thought that the misery of a chattclge was merely constituted by the clothes vesling bones, which were also warm, but which were adapted to the eye of the painter hy their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, devious and rich: these reasons, at the time of his entry into gay circles, many mothers subjugated him, trying to describe with the least trutb their languishing or scrambling favorites: the girls at the same time, by the faces jrbrjghting when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely balls, he was surprised to find, shot, except in the tallow on wax candles that freaked out, not fram the presence of a ghost, but of wclnt of snvffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congerios of plaids images and defriptions contained in these values, from which he misformed his study. On the other hand, by seeing his gratified vanity, some compensatlon Iri refrain from abandoning the dreams of hjs, when the extraordinary being we described above, orders him in his career.\nHe struck him; and the impossibility vcry to renounce an idea of the character of an inan entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, that the agreement tacjt to their existence, iplified by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imaginatiori to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forned this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to obsess the progeny of biscancy, rather tuna the person in front of him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, attached so far in his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually embarrassed Lord Rutbvon's back, and soon found that the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining some information about this character of singer, wbo, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, it was time for him to perform the hur, wbich for many generations has been necessary to allow the young lo to take a few quick sleps in the caroer os vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them the oppear as if fallen fresh skys, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasant or os praise, according to the dcgroe of the skill that there is to carry them. They conserilod: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentionioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a praposcll to join him. Flattened by svch a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had pasfed the waters of Eirolirig.\nHilhcrto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Rvthuen, now he found, that, although most of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions of the apparent m0tive to his conduct. His currency was abundant in his liberality; — the lazy, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand that cnough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could avoid rema...\nrking, that he was not on the virtuoso, reduced to indulgence by the accompanying misfortunes even on virluus, that he granted his olms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; 6ut when the profligate came to ask f0mething, nol to relieve his wonts, bul to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. However, this has been attributed by hlm to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the chassary of his Lordship, which was fatill more impressed on his mind: a1l those upon whom he wos granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion began to seize the centros of all fashjonable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always gathered success, excepl where the known antagonist wos bis, and then he lost even inore than hc won; but he always began to take hold of the same nacelle of imbangirig, with the whicb which he generally looked around society: it was not, however, when he caught the eruption of a young ri0vice, or the father without luck of a Numrovs family; then his wlsh seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was removed, and his eyes were astonished with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, for fear that he had previously asfluenl youth, torn from the oar, cursed, in the madness of a dungeon, the thal spell had attracted him to the reach of thls proud; while mary a father sat fraritic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his last immense wealth, when with even your buy enough to satisfy their present desire. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of mary, the last dorlot that he had just ripped off the convulsive catch of the innocent: this mugght but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, Howevor, able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him for reslgri tbat charity and pleasure wbich turned out to be tho ruin of al1, and did not take it for his own benefit; — but ho retarded— for it is to be hoped that his friend would give him a little bringunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, bc did not get greater grolification of it than the constant oxoitization which vainly wanted to break this mystery, whatb to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatvral itself.\nThey soon went to Rome, and Aubrey for a last glance from his companion; he left him every day in the presence of the mornirig circle of an Italian countess, as he went to search for memorials in an almost deserted city. When he was so engaged, lettcrs madroyed englarid, whom he opened with impatience; the first was frain bis sister, breathing without hlng but affection; the others were fram his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his cornion, they seemed to give him a valid reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediately 1aving his money, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, f0r than the possession of irresistible powcrf of seduction, making bis 1incentious bacits more dangerous lo society. It had been dlsco vered, that his econtempt for adultery had not originated jn hcltred from his character; but that he demanded, in order to strengthen bis gratification, that his viotim, the associate of his guilt, shou1d be precipitated from the pinnacle of the unsuspected virus kills, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: iri fine, tbat all the semals which he had sought, apparently on the accustomance of their virtue, had, since his departure, even threw the mask, and bad do not scruple themselves to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey broke away by leaving one, who had a character who had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abjure him completely, in order, in the meclri during, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass light circulantarices by non-noticod. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that bis Lordship was cndavourous to work until the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of which h0uso il chjefly frccnt. In Italy, it is rare for a married woman to be met in society; he was there before he pursued his plans in the surret; but Aubrey's eye followed hjm In all his tricks, and soori discovered that an assignment had been named beeri, whlch would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though infallible girl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthuen's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet his very close tbat. Lord Ruthven replied: tal his internions were pursued as he thought Oll would live on such an occasion; and upori being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; immediately, he noted to Fay, that he had to refuse to accompany his lordshlp in the rcmainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search for others apart, and called the mother of Iady, accompanied him with all that he knew, not as regards the ber davghter, but as regards the character of his lordship. The assignment has been proven. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to n0tify his consent c0rnplete to a separation; but did not suggest any suspicion of his hodging plans were foliod by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, foon found himself in Athons. He then fixed his rosidencc in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of traoing the records faded from monuments giory vpon anoients who, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of the Freomens only in front of the slaves, had hidden themselves flouted the floor protruding or many colorlichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a heligium, so beautiful and so delicate, that sho could have formed the model of a painter wishing loforlray a canvas the pramized hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke to 0 a lot of spirit for ony ony to thjnk she could belong to tbose who had no Sauls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought the look island a type po0r of her beauties; for who would have exhausted her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, sor tbat slecpy luxuri0us look of animal tbe flees but to the taste of an epic. The ligbt ftep of Iclntbe 0ften accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the dishonest girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmerc, would show the beauty that is of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to euger the look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just decrypted vpon a tablet almost from the front, in contemplation of her figure of sylph. Osten would like her braids to fall, to flirt around, to expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, to excite the oblivion of the antiquarian, which leaves the very object he had before the end of his mjnd. o the vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passagc jn Pausanias. But why linger at shades that all feel, but none can cling?—It was jnnocencc, young, ond 6eavty, without being affected by the arid drawing salons Stiflirig balls. While he was drawing rems of which he wanted to keep a mernoriclI for his future hours, she stood hy, arid looking at the magical effects of her perietal, in traoing the scenes of her place natjve; she would then describe to him the danoe circling on the open plain, painted him, in all the brilliant colors of the youth meinory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and tben, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mlnd, told him all the adrenalal tales of her nurse. His seriousness and his appearance of what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the first uippyre, who had passed yess in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a pretty femalo to prolong his existence for the months that followed, his blood ran, while he tried to laugh at it by so many idle and horrible faritasies; but Ianthe quoted to him the names of old men, who had finally detected an am0rigeIves living, after several af lhoir near relatjvef and children had been marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she sounded so irritated, that he begged him to appease him, for it had been noticed that these wbo had dared to question their exjstence, awclys had some proof, which made him confess his heart, and told him: She detached from him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise disillusionment of Lord Ruthven; however, he continued to persecute her, not to have any truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excile a bell tower in Lord Ruthven's supernctural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted by the uirlucs affected by the men among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, gained hive heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of EngIjsh habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still ho found himself more and more attached to the almost magical form of himself. He was tearing himself to Timcs srom her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he was leaving, determined riot t0 return untll1 his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fjx his attention to the ruins around him, which in bis mnd he killed an image that seemed to be the sole possessor rjghtful of his acronyms. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was had the same frank child that he known hcld fjrst. She always seemed to separate herself from the reluctance of hjm wjth; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visile her favor haunts, while the guard ber was busy sketching or displacing a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, clnd tbey botb, wilh several present, claimed their existence, pale wjlh horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of the bis excursions, which had to keep him sora for a few hours; he who heard the name of the place, they immediately begged him for the riot to return to the neighborhood, as it is necessary to pass through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the station of the vampyres in their night orgies, and set the rnostheavy evjls as imperative on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried t0 I will t0 them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so as to mock a superior, infamous power, the very name of whlch apparently rendered blood thoir free ze, he wos silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey salted up0n his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obscure the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, intimidating the belief of horrible fiend thofe, had irritated larn with svch terror. When it came to talking, Ianthe came beside his horse, and began seriously to bring him back, night cre allowed to put into action the power of the thc beings;—he promised. However, he was so ocupated in his research, that he did not understand that the light of the day was going to ignite, and that in theory there was a 0f the spots which, in the warmer calmals, rapjdly gathcr in a tremble mass, and pour all their rclge on the devoted land.—He finally, rainbow, mounted his horse, deleminated lo moke by the speed at his delay: but he was too lale. Twiligbt, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: ond e he had odvariated far away, the storm's power was above — his thunders failing had barely a resting interval — his heavy thick rairi forced his way through the cranberry foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at hjs very feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the forest of Entanglcd. The animal, at last tired, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a hovcl which hardly rose from the masses of dead hounds and brush that surrounded it. Dism0unting, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust in the shelter of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a mirigrig woman with the suffocation of mockery, out of a lclugh, continued in an almost intact sovnd; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided the hive. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the findings continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He came into contact with the fome one, which he seized immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Always bafflecd!\" and he felt harassed by the one whose strength seemed superhuman: he distangled himself to sell his life as hard as he was, he was fighting; but he was in a valley: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself, kneeling on his chest, had bent his hands on his throat—where the glare of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, the trouble; — rose up instantly, clinged, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at a time the crushing of the branches of thc, as he broke the wood, was more heard ria. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded with big soot glitter on each foot. In search of Aubrey lhey who had attracted him to his screams, he was again left in the darkness, but it was his horror, when torches light again 6urst on him, to perceive the aerial form of his coriductor liver brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision that came up disturbed imagination; but either agairi saw the healthy f0rm, when he unlocked them, scattered by his side. There was no heart on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that clinged to the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his thr0at were the marks of teeth that opened the vein: — to these men pointed, weeping, struck simultaneously wjth borror, \"At Varnpyre! A vampire!\" A litter was formed, and Aubrey was iaid next to her who had lalely been to him the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of llf who had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were: the spirit was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflector, the orid took refuge in the vacancy; he had almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular cortruation, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly welcomed by different parties who had been recruited into the searohof that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, if they approached the cjty, prepared the parents for a terrible catastrophe. \"For descrjbo their sorrow would be iinpossib1c; but when they had dried up the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable; both died in the heart of brokon.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with the most violent fever, and was often delirious; on occasion he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe — by an unusable combination it seemed in turn to his fragrant companion to spare the beloved being. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the houso somc, and bewitched his attondanl oonstonl. When he withdrew from his delirium, he horrified and stunned the sight of him whose image he had combined with the thal of a varnpyr; but the Lord Rulh-\nBy his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separatism, and even more by the atteriti, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soon reconciled his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; only the apothetic boing that had so surprised Auhrey, but as soon as his 6egan convalescence to be quick, he agajn graduated-\nAlly pulled back in the same state of mind, clrid Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, wlth a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engulfed by looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyefowl of all.\nThe spirit of Avbrey, by this shock, was much curved, arid this elasticity of the mind that hcld once if dlstingujshed it riow seemed to run away forever. He was now as fond of solitvde and silencc as Lord Ruthven; 6and although he was still solitude, the spirit did not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he had previously frequented, Ianthe's shape stood by his side – if he looked for him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, to the wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a sweet smi1e vpon his lips. He has determined to make beautiful scenes, all of which have created bitter associations in his mind. He introduced Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had takon of him during his illness, whom they shook alive these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and they sought every place to whip a resolerance that they had clinged to; but they hastened from one place to another, but they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard thugs, but they gradually began to lighten the relationship, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interost was to expel the generosity of t hoso which they defended against the pretoned dangers. As a result, by neglecting the counsel of the inbebitants, they occasionally traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. Incoming upori, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for there was only a few of the portals engaged in the pass of Nclrow, when they were starred by the bul-\nleaves near their heads, and by echoing the report of several rifles. In a...\nThe guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, they had started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their examination, withdrew for a moment behind the shelling of the defilement: but shameful to be so detained by a f0e, who, with insulting cries, hurt them, arid being exposed to unroslstirig slaughtcr, if one of the thieves sh0uld cl imb a60ve and take them into the rcar, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost the she1ter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shovlder, which led him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to seek help; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by the fact that the robbers gave him his face — his guords having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately tossed his arms off.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon instructed them for oonvey bis friend wounded to a cahin neigbbouring; and having accepted on a ransom, he was not indiscreet by their presence — they were content to keep the entrance until their comrade retum with the sum prarnized, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly diminished; in two days, the bitter mortification, and death proceeded with precipitated stcps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of objeets about him: bul towards the olose af tho lasl evening, his mind seems unhealthy, and the bis eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer bis assistunce with more than usual solicitude—\"Assist me! You save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I've listened to the death of my existence, just like the death of the day of the pasf; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? Tell me haw? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little of my life flourishes, I can do everything, if you want to concoal everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and I was known for some time in England, I—but read. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dyirig man, rising up with exulting violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to the living being in all calamity, whatever happens, or whatever you may see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their base: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was laughing on his pillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circonstones attended to his knowledge with this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a fall came to him, as if there came from the presentation something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hoveI into what he had left the body, wben a thief met him, arid informed him that it was not 1onger there, having been eonveried by himself clnd camerades, at the time of retirement, at the pina-\nAccording to a promise they had made to his seigneury, he had to be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and taklng several 0f men, determined to go and bury him on the place he sowed. But, when he had m0unted lo the top be faund no trace of body or tbe elothes, although the rohbers swore that they reported the identical rock on whicb they laid the body. For some time his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but hc finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he encountered such terrible misfortunes badly, and in which al1 appearedryly conspired to increase that supersliti0us melancholy who had seized on his urid, he decided to leave him, ond soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a vessol lo passed it on to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of the lasse which he had had belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, it was a case involving several criminal weapons, the purpose of which was to ensure the death of the victim. Therc were several daggers and ataghans. If he turned them around and examined their wound forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style as the daggor discovered in the hut fataI — he trembled — rushing to obtain other evidence, he found his weopon, and his horror can be imagined that he discovered that it was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in the bis hand. His eyes seemed no more secure: faith seemed to be linked to the dagger; however, he wanted to get rid of joy; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the haft and the sheath were both splendorful, and lefl had no place for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrno, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had sought to extract from the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. His parents were in distros, their forlone ruined, and sbe had not been heard since the departure of his seigneury. Aubrcy's spirit became alinose broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had a victim at Ianthe's tho destroyer. He became morose and silerit; and his only profession was to exhort the postilions of speed, as if he were going to save the ljfe of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way on the English shores; and he hastened to the inarision of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sisler, all memory of the past. If before, by her jnfantine caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to approach, she was even more boring as a companion.\nMiss Aubroy did not have this winning grace that gairis the ga2e and applause from the salon assemblies. There was no bones than the 6rillianoy light that exists anly in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was an aboul meIancholycharm that did not seem to emerge from mlsfortune, but frowns some enemy inside, which seemed to induce a consecuous soul of a brighter kingdom. Its step is not so liberating, that a butterfly or a color can attract it, that is, it was sedate and pensive. When one of them, his face was not illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection, and forgot in prescnee those deed that she knew to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged the smile of lhat of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then plclying in the light of their own native spbere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been subjected to war, for she had been more fit by her gvardians than her presentation had to be delayed upon her return from her brother of the continuenl, what could she be her protector. So it was now solved lhot the next salon, which was approaching, should be the time of its entry into lbe \"busy sccnc.\" Rather, Aubrey wovld remained in the house of his magnifiers, fed on the melancholy that dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fasbionnable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; bul he decided to sacrifice his own comfort for the protection of his sjster. They soon arrived in town, and prepared the next day f0r tbe, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to grin in the smile of the kingship, hastened to do so. Avbrey was there with his sister. As he swung into a corner by himself, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the remorse that, the first time he had seen Lard Ruthven was in that truthful place, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, in a voice which he well recognized, sounded in his ear: \"Rend your oath.\" He had barely coordinated your turn, tiring to see a tbclt spectrum would explode it, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his opinion a lhif spot when he first entered sooïty. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friar, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were asraid, his tang hts were inflamed with bis 6rain. Lord Rut hven again accuse him — circumstances started in the dreadfvl picture — the dagger — his oath. — He blushed back, he covered the riot believe it is possible — death rises agajn! — Ho thought his imclginatiori had conjured vp the mental hjs image was upsetting. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore declerates, to go ogain in society; for although he tried to ask for eoncerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his sister t0 the assembly of o near relalion. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to recreation, and Tobero gave himself up to his own devoring thoughts. Percivjng, last clt, which many were leaving, he woke up himself, and centering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to inove, turn around, and revealed to him the features of thofe he had the most heinous. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with the hurrjed step, forced her to the street; at the door he himself snuck up by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and wbiie ho was committed to passing them, he heard this voice whispering near him: \"Remember thy oalh!\"\"He dared to turn, but, pressed his sister, saon came to the house.\nAubrey became the most distracted. If before hjs mlnd hcld 6een absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now that certalnty 0f the living of the monster has again pressed on his thoughts. The sister's attentions were now irrelevant, and it was in vclin thal shc ln treated her to explain to her what had caused bis abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he walked, the more he was bcwildcred. His oath came up, hjm;—did he allow this monster to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he had of gold, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he violates his oath, and reveals his suspicions, who would attract him? He thought of opulating his own hand to free the world of tbe frornsucb a wretched; but death, he remedied, had already been mocked. For days he remained in his condition; locked in his room, he could not see anything, and only when his sister came, who, with streomirig eyes with tears, begged him, for her, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear sylnoses and loneliness, he leaves his house, street street roamod, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress spoiled, and he wandered, as an oster exposed to the midday sun as well as to the midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned with him at night at home; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by fatigue. His sieve, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they quickly defamed themselves by him who fled from a prvsuer faster than any other, far from you. His conduct, however, suddenly chongcd. Struggled by the idea that by his presence he left all his friends, with a siend amorigst, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter agaln in society, and to look closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all those who in Lord Ruthven learned spiritual irimatity. But when he entered the hall of cl, his gazes of baggard and suspicion were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to let go to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the reappearance collapsed, the guardians thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would ease, they thought it was very strong to recall the trust that had been imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had daily suffered from his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye those marks of the whale which they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the houso, and to take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incohorence finally bccams so great, that he was confined to the bls chamber. There he often lied for days, unable to boast. His eyes were bad with a glassylustre;—the only sign of arid affection himself remembered his sister's entrance; then he sometimes began, ond, to grasp his hands, with Io oks tbat gravely distressed, he wanted her not to touch HLM. \"Oh, don't come near him, if you need me, don't come near him!\" When, howeuer, sho asked whom he mentioned, bis only the answer was, \"True! True!\" and again hc sank inta a state, from which even she did not cau ld wake him up. Tbls lasted many months: gradually, comments, as the year passed, his lncaherences became frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guards observed, that sevora once in the day he counted up to 0n his fingers a defined nvmber, and tben smile.\nThe rioarly had passed, when, on the last day of the year, onc of his guardians inheriting from his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Immediately Aubrey drew his intention; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whose lhey feared that hc had been declined, they brought the name of the Count of Mar sden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed ploughed, and astonished them even more by his exhibition of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his lovatory smile; for he pressed his chest t0, and kissed his cheek, wet of tears, of flow-\nTo the idea that his brother is more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congregate the hcr vpon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accom fold; when ho suddenly perceived a medallion on his panties; opcning it, which was his overpriced to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus despised the resumption of her future husband, he seemed to understand it, then to grasp the hands of ber, to look at it with a frenetic expression, to swear that she never married this inonster, for he — but he could have rioted advanted — it seemed that if this hiin bclde again remembered his oath — he turned abruptly ravnd, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. The guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing and thought it was only cl retum of her disorder, entered, forcing Miss Aubroy to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged the trick to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined having taken hold of his spirit, enslaved to pacify him and to withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother aflor the living room, and had been truffled with too many others. When he heard of Aubroy's health, he willingly seized him for his cause; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleas could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenuated of great offense for the brother and interest in the Bis destiny, be graduated by the ear of Miss Au6rey. Who could resist his power? His language has dangers and tools to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the earth of crowds, except with the one to whom he addressed;—could say haw, sin what he knew, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, was it simply that hc could enumerate with his soothing accents;—finally, hc knew it so. how to use the art of serpenl, or this was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. As the title of the older branch fell to it in length, he obtained an important charassis, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brothel,) which was to take place on the very day of his departure from the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but jn failed. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sieve, conjuring her, she attaches value to her own happiness, her own hanour, and the honor of those who are now in the grove, who held her in their arms as their hope and hope of the house to delay but sor cl a few hours of marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sorcerers promised that TBey would deliver it; bvt give it to the doctor, he tangbt itbetter to no longer harass Miss Aubrey's mind by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest the occupied prisoners of the bouso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be easier than described, the notes0f occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sovnd of the wagons braked on his ear. Aubrey grcw almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilance, they gradually looted, lurking in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized Ibe opportunity, if a related was out of the room Tbe, and at a moment was in the appclrtment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the bim: he approached himself immodestly, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. Wben on the etajrcase, Lord Ruthvenwhlspered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my sling in the day, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, usurped by the old womo, had come in search of him. Aubroy could lean on himself; his fury, which had no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and it was transmitted to bcd. This n0t was mentioned to his sjster, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriclge was solemnized, and the bride, married, left London.\nAubrey iricrea's weakness; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. We could call his sister's gvardians, and when the hour of the night hit badly, he wrote what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guclrdianshastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but who they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"Tho world was in front of him, where to choose his plcc of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Majefty's bladders, jn in 1812, we put inlo the prefect of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of his placc, and the certain suspense of cattle and vegots still to have had thero, lead many Britishesses to visit it — both the men of war and mercha-\nntmen; and although jt is caught off the track for ships linked to Smyrne, his premiums amply reimburse for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the handbag bandaged for cattlc with the natives, the clergy arid me at 0k rambled lo the cave called Homer's Sch0ol, and 0ther placcs, where we had already looked. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met the spirit and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had the same of Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felvcca. \"He hired me like a pawn,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I didn't have cbo0se to leave Mitylene, what am I likely to marry. He was a DJ, but a very good man. The cottagc above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gavo Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechines sor it, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there about eighty manths, although he is not tough; so he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nTbis accovnt greatly excited our chill, and we did not waste time rushing into the house where aur countryman had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartmcnts on the floor-floor—an entrance hall, o living room, a sittirig parlovr, and a hed-room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: simple wcllls, marhle tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed iri springing on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or s0fa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library of ernpty: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one mattress of barley lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets stuffed and one pillow – the 6 common throughout the Greece. In the rest room, we observed a marblc recreation, once, the old man told us, wired with books and papers, whooh were then in the chest of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves by examining the contents. On the Tablet of Recreation are the works of Voltajre, Sbakspeare, Bojleau and Rousseou, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerman, in German, the Messiah of Klopstock, the novels of K0tzebue, the room of the Robbers of SohilIor, the Paradise of Milton, an Italian building printed in Parma in 1810, several small pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, very torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these baoks wore marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked wilh slides the paper af, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they mvstlie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I move something without orders, he would throw me on for a week together; he is otberways vory g0od. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of him, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Armenian who wanders in a house of srall in the wood of Tbe, clnd that the lord brought here brake Adrianople; I do not know for which reson.\"\nThe external tbe bouse appeorence was pleasant. The portico jn front was fifty steps lorig and fourteen broad, and the marblc pillars canned with black plinths and corriches sret-work, (cls it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were c0nsidorably hjgher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, benealh an awning of coarse linen strong. Most houso-tops are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left, we enter the house, a small stroclmlel glissa, grapes, oranges and lime were clotted together on its borders, and under the shade of two bushes of largcmyrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were read, the lord passed many of his euonings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our ehurcb twice a week, 6esidos Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be described as a \"bird view\". An os rieh virieyards line led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olives and bilberries flowers of iri, and on the top of which an ancient Greek dull appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stretchlm escapes from the ruins that descend into broken waterfalls, until it is the last in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea is smooth as the glclss, and a borizon not overshadowed by an eloud sour, tarnished the view in front; and a wing on the lholeft, thrugb a vista of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, the small severcll islands were clearly obsessed, spreading the llghl blve wove wove with spols of emerald green. I feldom enjoyed a view more than I did; but our demands bore fruit like the riam of the person who had rode in this romantic solitude: no one knows his name but Dominick, hjs banker, who had gane in Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conduct, \"could he say, bul I am sure he will not do it,\" and can you not say, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on the return ovr lo the city we learned the feveral details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the tho island, and evon daric with them at the Riuptielle party. Ho gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the glitters that live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fjsberman who had lost his own in a storm, and he gave Greek teftaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to have been a very eccentric and henivolent character from all that we have collected. A circumstance lurks us, which ovr old friond at cottoge ght praper not to reveal. Hc had a very majestic daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bougbt a pian0-forte, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who its rambling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricties that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our dovbts were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr FOSTER, the archbltect, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The indivjdual,\" he said, \"of whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordshjp, cls we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put irito our hands we re-elected the reclus of Calcla in the eurey page. Have we not regretted that we have not been more numerous in our research at the cottage, but we have joined the idea of returning to Mitylene the next day, but to me that day will never return. I make his statement, attesting him not entirely uninterestingirig, and in court to his seigneury name, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human naturo, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The sact is terribly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anedotes. All the finer feelings of heart, fo elegarily depicts in the poems of his seigneury, so have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon which the Religion sealed his heart, and upon which hcad Bénévolence threw his coat. No cari man has read the previous pleasant \"trails\" without bragging about him as a countrymari. With respect for his love or p1asuref, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. We must always receive rapports with calion, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and he who dared to justify himself before the horrific trinal where everything must appear, only blame errors towards another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and avoiding applause from the world, is the tcstimony trick of a vjrlous audience and Confcienoe self-approval.\nTHE END\nGi llet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "32": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is foundcd is very general in tho Orient. Among the Arabs, it seems to be cammon: it does not, arch...\ncvor, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its form presounded only from the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body would not corrupt itself buried lf in the Tbeir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, stili exist, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the broom of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with variations of mass, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the exislcd belief, that vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, loosed their strength and died quickly of consumption; while the human lhees 6 suckers grated — and their veins became distended to evacuate a state of ropletion, in order to cause the blood of all the posages of their bodies, and always pores of their skin, to flow.\nIn the London Journal of Maroh, 1732, is a ouri0us, and, of course, the credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It is, in fact, that by examining the chief comparator and the magistrates of the place, one had heard positively and not animovs1y clfsirmed, that, about five years later, a certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servie, he had been tormented by a varnpyre, but had had a way to get rid of the evil, eating somc from the earth of the gravillon of the vampyre, and rubbing his sons with his blood. This precauti, rainbow, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hlmself; for, about twenty or thirty doys after his deathb and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attaeks. To avoid further misadventures, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in vampyism cases) fresh, and whole1y free from corruption, and the etinction splints the muzzle, nose, and ears, the pure florid blood clnd. Since Proaf was thus obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was entirely pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, at the time when he was recited for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. And they took his head off, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The few measures were adopted with the tbose orses of people who had provously died of vampyrism, lest they should, in their tvrn, the vpon otber agents who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person sucked by avampyre hecames o volmyre hlmself, and sucks iri its turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to the subject of the present o6servations thari any instance that c0 could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, far from some hcirov crime committed while in exjstonce, the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrlse, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth — tbose to whom he was taken by the ties of kiridrcd and ffection. — A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be praised from his tomb; and then haunted the place of origin, Aridsuok the blood of every race Ly; there of thy daughter, sisler, wife, At midnight drairi the stroclm of life; Yetloathe the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livjd livirig oorse, thy victims, ero they exhale again; Shail knows that tbe demoried for their sire; In curse, thou cursed them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But the one who for your crime must fall, the youngest, better praised 0f all, Sball blesses you with the name of a sather—This word will wrap your heclrt in flame! And yet, the last glazed look must see What freezes o'er itf blue lifeless; Then the hand without Halloween will tear The toses of his yellow air, of which, iri life a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn—But now is neo awoy hy the Memorial of thirie agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning tooth, and your harry lip; then harassing to tby svllen falls, Go-arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror shrink Fr0m spectrum more cursed than they.\nMr. Sou-\nThey also introduced into his beautiful wild paem but from \"Thalaba\", the vampyrous corse of the Arab Majd Oncizcl, which is rethought as having resisted from the grave in order to torment him, she loved better what is in existenee. Bvt this cannot be assumed hclve results from tbe sinflness of her life, she threw the whale of the tale as a complete type of purity and jnnoeence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of cases of severe clstonishing of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, jn his work of groat on this subject, besides a uariety 0f anecdotes, and the traditional narratives illustrious of its effects, put forward some learned dissertations, tending to provc it to be a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions on this singularly horrib1e superstitjon could be added; although the current means suffices for the limits of a note, nokssarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be corincided by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general ccceptation, there is seueral otbers synonymovs with it, makes use af en var-\nregions of the world: Vrouoolocha, Vardulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the dissjpatioris that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank, appeared to the different parties of the ton leaders. He was making fun of him, as if he couldn't participate here. Apparently, Tbe Ijghl laughs at the fair only attracted his attention, so that he can by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixirig on the face of an obiect tbe, did not seem to penetrate, and with one glance to pierce throvgh to the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities used him to invite him to the house of greed; all wanted to see him, and these wbo had been used to violent excitement, and now selt lhe weight of boredom, were plcased to hack something in their hairy presence to engage their attention. In the aspile of the dead hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, many female hunters, after notoriety, have tried to gain attention, and to win, at least, some marks from which they might be affectionate: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfter worn in the drawing rooms since her marrage, has started, and put everything except on the robe of a Montane bank, to attract her attention:—but in vain:—when she passed before him, although the eyes of hjs were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed bone if they were not pierced;—even her uncrowned impvdenene waf bafied, and she left the field. But even if the common oulter could not influence even the direction of his eye, there was not that the female sex was undifferentiated to him; however, he was particularly careful with whom he addressed the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, but few knew that he was speaking to domestics. However, he had the repudiation of a wjnning tongue; and if it was the struggle she even averced the fear of her singular chclracter, or that the lhoy was moved by her apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among those women who boasted of their sex of their doistic virtuosities, as among those who shoved her by their viccs.\nAt about the same time, he arrived in London a young gentleman 0f the name af Aubrey: he was an orphan left with a single sniff in the possession of great wearlh, by pclrents who died while he was still in existence. To him too...\nThe guards, who thought it was their duty to take care of his fortune, while abandoning the most important burden of his mind, the care of the subaltem mercenaries, caught up more in his emergence than in his judgment. He therefore had this sense of honour and of Romanesque frankness, which, every day, destroys so many apprentices mil-iners. He believed everything to sympathize with the vjrtue, and thought that thal vice was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a collage consisted simply in the vestirig of the clothes, whlch were as hot, but wbich were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folding and various col0ured patches. Ho thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the straightness of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, on his entry into gay circles, many mothers subjugated him, trying to describe with the least truth the favourites tbeir 1anguisbing or snoring: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon brought him to false notions of his talents and merit. He was attached to the romance of solitary hours of hjs, he was surprised to flirt, that, except in the tallow and wax almonds that freaked out, not in the presence of a ghost, but frorn lacks snuffing, there is no foundation in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant photos and dissoriptions contained in these v0lums, from which he had formed his study. However, by finding compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to reread his dreams, when the oxtraordinary being that we described above, went through the hive in his career.\nHe observed it, and it was very impofsibi1lty to form an idea of the character of an entire man ashsorbed iri himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, that the lacit consent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: to allow his imoginalion to paint all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly forced this objeot into the hero of a romance, and discouraged to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the persori in front of him. He made himself known with him, drew attention to him, and so far has advanced on his opinion, which his wcls presence has always recognized. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and the saon found, according to the notes of preparation in — Streot, that he was aboul t0 voyage. Desirous af gain a certain incultation about this singular chclr acter, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that there is time for him to tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to enablo the young to take a little quick sleepf in the pillow of vice to put them on an equality with the old, and not to allow the in to appear as fallen of the skjes, scandalous wbonever intrigues are mentioned as the subjecls of pleasaritry or praise, according to the degree of skjll that there was in the holding of these skjes. Thcy argued: and Aubrey immediately begged his intentions your Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from bim a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a brand of csteem of him, who, apparently, had nothing in the cornmon with other men, ho willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Auhrey bad had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now hc has found, hot, although rnany more of his actlons have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different cor inclusions of the motifs appear to his conduct. His oompanion was profuse iri his liberality; — the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enougb to relieve their immediate needs. But Auhrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the calamities that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he lowered his alms; - this was senl from the door with sneezes barely crushed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to fulfill his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich purity. However, it was altribvd by him to the greater importunity 0f the vicious, whicb gcnera1ly prevajls on the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more clear on the mind: all those whom he was granted upori, inevitably found that there was a cu on her, so that they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk down and lbe the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrcy was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought centros of all the modelable vices; there he entered into all the tbe spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, unless the known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but he always made the same immutable face, with which he sweeped society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a great famjly; then his very desire seemed fortune; this apparent abstraction of the spirit was cast aside, and if the eyes shone the fire of death than that of the cat that deluded with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he is afraid that the old youth flocked, torn apart from the cjrcle which he has adorned, elucidating, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him into the reaoh of this fiend; while rnany a father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his late immensc wealth, where to buy eucn sufficient for sotisfy t hejr present envy. However, he did not take any scramble to the tablo garnling; immediately ivt, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just rolled off from the convulsive take of innocent TB: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which did not waf, Howevcr, capable of fighting the most experienced hearing. Avbrey often wanted to drop this lo his friend, and begs him to resign this barbarity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring to his own profit; — but to be delayed — for every day he hoped to give him a certain contribution to speak frankly and openly to him; comments, tbis never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes af nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than the lips of hls; and although Aubrey was riare on the 0bjoct of the curiosity of hls, he did not obtajn'obtaj any more gratification of him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of the coin; he let him attend every day the morning cir cle of an Italian woman, as he went in search of the memarials of another almost deserted city. To the extent that he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, having only affection; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had previously entered into his tbat thero imagination was a bad power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he left his friend and urged that his character be terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for sociology. He had been distraught, that his contempt for adultery had not origirated jn hatred of his character; but tbat he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratificati0n, that his victim, the partner of the guilt of hjs, shovld be cast out of the pinnacle of the virtue urisul1ie, the dawn at the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in the end, all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtuco, had, since his disrepair, even thrown the mask, and had not scrambled t0 excase thc any deformity of tbeir vicef in the public eye.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shaken a single luminous point on which to hold his eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to completely abandon the bim, purposive, intho mean then, to monitor it more eloquently, and at 1 and not light circumstances go through vnnotioed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience if the daughter of the lady of whom he was head frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all its windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the ruin of the innocent ari, although tchettedloss girl. Losing rio shooting, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abrvpt1y asked him for his respite iritentions at the lcldy, closing him at the time of the samc that he knew he was about to meet her that night. Lord Rutbven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an occasion; and when he rushed if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Avbrey withdrew; and, immediately by writing a note, to say, that from this rnoment he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and sticking to the mother of the lady, irritated him with all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to his daughter.\nIt is an oharacter of his Lordship. The transfer was prevented. The next day, Lord Ruthven sent his sergeant more often to riot his complete assemblage at the separation of cl; but did not mention any suspicion as to his plans having been thwarted by the interpositlon of Aubrey.\nHavirig left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greeco, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found hjmself al Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so0n became accipehim by tracing tho faded records of ancient glory on thal monuments apparently, shame of chr0nicling the acts of free men only before the slave, had hidden under the floor sheltoring or many colored llchen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a beirig, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have f0rmed fashion1 for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mahoinet, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone could be among those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, taming the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep af the animcll adapted hut to the taste of an epic. Ianthe's stop of light often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and osten went to the unconscious girl, engaged jn the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmere, show thc all his beauty of his form, flooaling as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he just made in a tabiet almost erased, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the delicate svch ray brilliantly and quickly erasing himself, he might well cxcuse the oblivions of the anliquary, which let escape from his mind the very obicct that he had before tangbt of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a pclssage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and narcotic balls. As he drew the remains of what he wanted to preorce a memorial for his future hours, he stoned it, and looked at the mogic effects of his pencil, tracing the views of his p1ace riative; she would then describe to revive the waxing upori dance the open plain, painted, to him, touching the oolourf bursting from the memory of the youth, the marriage pump remembered having seen in his infamy; and tben, turning to subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on the mind, wovld told hlm all the supernatural tales of his nurse. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which bcld passedod years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear bonds, forced at the year, by nourishing the life of a beautiful woman to spread her existence for the montbs who followed, her blood would run co1d, while he tried to draw her from so many idle and horrific fantasies; but Ianthe quoted for a hlm the nclms of old men, who had not detected among them for the last time, after several of their relatives relativity and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of the fiend; arid when shc found him so unbelievable, she begged to believe him, for he had 6ecn, pointed out, that those who had deroved their existence, ohways bad some evidence given, wbich forced, with confessing him and the true heart. She detailed to him the triclditiona1 appearance of these monsters, and her horror intensified, hearing a very precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief jn the supreme power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virtues of the womcn among which he had sought for his vision of love, won his hell; as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still he has been increasingly attached to the sorm of Alinoste fairy before him. At times he would tear her up, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would go away and decide not to return until her object had been reached; but he always supported him impressible to focus his attention on the ruins around him, who was in his mind, he kept an image that seemed to be the only rigid possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe wasn't convincing of her love, and was always the French children's samo boing having first known. She has always separated herself from him with relvctance; but she has wcls because she no longer had anyone with whom she cuvld visit her favorite hevnts, that I occupied her warden in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped from the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, confirmed their existence, pale of horror in the name vory. Shortly afterwards, Auhrey torpedoed to make one of his excursions, which holds him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closed hod day, on any considerationatiori. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to search the way to the Jr. Aubrey made one look at their representations, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw Lhern trembling at his daring lhus to mock a superior, infernal power, the same riam of whooh apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for the excursion without lingering; he was surprised by the obsessive-\nthe melancholic side of its host, He mocked the belief of these horrible fools, who had inspired them by such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, squatting fervently from him lo relurn, the past night allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not understand that the light of day was about to end, that jn the horizon there were af these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass tremond0us, and shed all their rage on the devoted country.—He at 1st, however, m0unded his horse, determined to catch 6th speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern cllamates, is the unknown almosl; immediately the sun goes down, the neighborhood begins; and it had advanced far, the power of the st0rm was above — its ech0ing thurders barely bad the ari de resl interval — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the canopy leaflet, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate its feet. Suddenly his horde became afraid, and he began to carry with terrible speed through the entangled entanglement. The animal stopped, the fatigue stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the masses of dead water and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find another ta gujde hirn in the city, or at least tru-\nto get a shelter from the 0f shovel of the storm. As he approached, the Lunders, inflaming themselves for a moment, gave him the opportunity to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with the suffocated and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound; — he was surprised: but, awakened by the bumblebee that the agairi was rolling on his head, he, mixing himself with a sudden ef0rt, forced the door of the hut. He found himself hlmself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Ho was apparently not perceived, for although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found himself in oontact with the fome one, which he immediately seized; when a voice shouted, \"Agaïri bafflied!\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt himself beaten by 0ne whose strength seemed superhuman: deterriod ta sell his life as dear af he could, he struggles with him.\nBut it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and cast onormo force against the earth; his enemy fell upon him, and knelt down on the breasts of bis, had put his bands on his throat, when the glare of many toro-\nHcs penetrating through the holc lhat gave light in the day, disturbed it;—he rose instantly, and, 1acring his prey, blushed through the door, and jn for a moment the crushing of the fathoms, as the wood breaks, was heard rio longer. The stork was still there, and Aubrey, able to move, made himself heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the lhaccb l0aded on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. At the desiro d'Aubrey, she was being searched for who had drawn her up with shouts of ber; he was again in the darkness; but wbat was his borbor, when the light of the torches once again burst him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corse without me. He closed his eyes, hopjng that he wcls but a vision coming from hls disturbanceiinagination; but he agajn saw the same shape, that he closed them, stretched by his fidc. There was no colour on his cheok, nat even on his lip; but there was silence lowering his face lhat sect almost as endearing as the 1 rise that the anoe lived there: — on his neck and breost wos blood, and on his throat there were marks of blood having opened the vein: — so that men might point, weep, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire! A vampire!\" A litter was formed q uick1y, and Aubrey was loid by the side to the af she who had lalely been for him the object of so many straight visions and faith, now fallen with the flower of life thal was dead with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the search, and to take refuge in vocaney, he held almost consciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, whieh had been his in the cabin. They were soon wearing a different part.\nThose who had been involved in his mother's search had not fed well. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their sorrows would be impossible; but when they assured the cause of the child's decline, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. Tobey was incoriable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey was put to bed with a very violent fever, so the arid was often delusional; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he rented. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rutbven, was lucky at that time to arrive clt Athens, and, from any motivc, upan hearing of the state af Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and beoamo his constant steward. The one who recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished to see the image he had had of him, and he joined in the tbat spirit of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his words, involving alm0ft repentance for the fault lhat hcld caused their feparatiori, and sti1l more by the attentlon, anxiety, and ore that he showed, soon reconciated hi to his presence. His seigneury felt completely changed; he no longer seemed to be apatbetic tbat who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalescence began to be rapid, he gradually agonized in the same state of mjnd, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference compared to the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his ga2e fixed with insistence on him, with an inconceivable smile of exultation playing upori hjs lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Durlng the last stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Rvthuen wcls apparently committed to look at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the neckless sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyos of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much curved, and this elasticity of the evil whicb mind once so distinguished now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his spirit would not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the rulns he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe staod by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly, would turn around, show to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded throal face, with a sweet smile on the ber's lips. He decided to steal scenes, each feature of whleh created such bitter assailations in his reindeer. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom hc was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, while they should visit the parts of Greece neitber had seen again. They washed in all directions, and sought every place where a memory could be attached; but while they hastened from one place to another, they did not take into account what they were looking at. Thcy heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which were part of the world.\nwere only the invention of individualaIs, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those wboms whom they defended froin claimed dangers. In the consecration of tbus neglecting the councils of the inhabitants, they traveled only with one seamstress, more for servo af guidedcf than as defon ce. However, by sinking, at the botlom of wbich, a narrow defilement was the bed of a torrendl, with masses of rock lorges descended from the nearby precipices, they could not repent of their negligence; for they barely surrendered to the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when the whistling of the bubbles closed their head, and by the reported echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had lefl lhem, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the part came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the shelling and turned the defilement: but shameful to be held by a soe, wbo with insulting cries the hadith ad van, and beirig exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers were to mount the abovc and bring them to the rear, they immediately decided to go forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him the land. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no danger preventing the contest, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards hastening, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately refloat their arms and faint.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon induced his wounded friend to a neig hbouring hut; and havirig reached agreement on a ransom, it was not inorted to be distracted by their preserice — they were simply absent from guarding the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which hc had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength declined rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His constancy and apperance had not changed; he felt as unconscious of the pain af he had been objects about him: bvt to Tbe cIase of the last evening, his mind became apparently urease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his help with more than the usual seriousness—\"Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I've listened to death if my existence is small as that of the passing day; 6but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little of my life flourishes, I can't explain all this, but if you hide everything you know about me, my hanour was fréo de la spot iri la rneuth du monde, and if my affair was unknown for some time to Englari—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him with exultant violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, wonder that, year and day, you will not lose your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or that you wage war yourself. \"The eyes of Hjs seemed to burst out their bases, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; \"he ran down and laughed on his foot, and no longer shook.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attended to his knowledge with his man arose on hjsmind, and he did not know why; when he rebuked his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, if of presentiance of tbc something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left his body, when a thief met him, arid informed him that he was n0 no longer there, having been coveted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the pinriacle of a nearby mountain, coordinating to a promise that he had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes devouring men, decimated to go on burying him on the place where he lcly. But, wben ho had climbed to the top, he found nolrace from here the body or clothes, brandish the thieves sw0re they pojnted out the identical stone tho on which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was perplexed in the corijectures, but he finally came back, conspired that they had buried the body for the love of all the clothes.\nWeclry of a country in whicb he had met wjth svch terrible misfortunes, and in whjch al-I apparently conspired to increase that superstitious melancholy Ihat had grasped on his mind, he resoIved to leave, and soon arrived in Smyrna. Wbile, waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or to Nclples, he took care of organizing the effects of thethosc he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthuen. There have been other cases containing several weapons, m0re or less suitable to violate Uictim's death. There were several daggers and ataghans. As he killed them, and examined their curious forins, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamented in the sclmo style while the dogger laid down in the fatal hut — he fuddered — eager to get other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined that He discovered that he was bleeding, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted to be wary; but the particular form, the same diversjngtints on the haft and the fheath were also in the splendor on the b0ème, and I have no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe Ieft Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, his first inquiries were searching for the lady he had tried to catch Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. His parents were in distress, their fortvne ruined, and sbe hod has not been the beard since the departure to his seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost burned under so many repeated horrors; it was afrajd that this lady had been the victim of the Iantbe destroyer. He bchame morose and silent; and his only job succeeded in exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he wanted to see. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swept him over the English coasts; and he hastened to reach the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the burnings and caresses of his fist, all memory of the past. If before, through her child care, she had taken her afsection, once that the woman began to appear, she became even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid look applause from the salon assembly. Thcre was not of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. The blue eye was never raised by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy c hclrm on this subject which did not seem to arise from the inisfortvne, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. Alone, her face shines with a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection...\nAnd would she forget in her presence those deed that she knew to rest her rest, which would show off her smile for Ihat of the Volvptuary? It seemed as the eyes are, — this face weird then play in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only eigbteen, and had not been introduced to the world, it was thought that hy herguardians were gnawing that her propensity should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, wben being her protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its cnlry in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have denied in the house of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that had overcome him. He could not feel interested in the srivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the ones he had witnessed; but was determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-ro0m.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not 6eeri hcld for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, haftened there. Aubrey wos l here with her sister. Let him stand in the ring by himself, without mingling with all that surrounds him, committing himself in the memory that the time he had seen Lord Rulhuen waf in that same place, he felt so fondly grasped by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in the ear of hjs – \"Remember your oalh.\" He had little courage to turn, fea rvl de seairig a specter that bluffed him, when he permeated, within a short distance, the same flgure wbich had drawn his attention to this place up to 0n bis first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and pushing a possession into the crowd, he threw himself into the bis car, and was a driver at home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed the hands of hjf on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts were inflamed by the brain of hjs. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath.—He woke up, he could not believe that he could — death hung on!—He thought that hls imaginallon had conjured the image on which his ind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to return to society; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name was hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few years later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leggling her under the protection of a matron, he gave the irito a pause, arid there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. When he finally saw that many were leavirig, he woke up, and on another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appeared-\nHe tried to pass by and pass by, when one of them, who asked him to move, turned around, and began to flout these traits, he abhorred them most. He went forward, grabbed his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, and forced her to the street: He found him, if he were hindered by the multitude of servarites waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing by, he heard again this voice whispering near him: «Remember your 0ath!»\"He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister bis, so0n touched the house.\nAubrey became almost djstracted. If before he had the evil mind was absorbed by a subject, how mucb more empolelly was he absorbed, now tbats the certainty of the monsler's life again pre--\nSedon on his thoughts. Her sister's attentioris was now irritated, getting bogged down in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He only read a few words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His 0ath surprised him;—was he hc tben so that this monster would wander, 6earirig ruln on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not avoid his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if we had to break his oath, and decipher his suspicions, who would believe Hiin? He was thinking of deploying his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he remembers, had already mocked beeri. For days remain iri this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he no longer captures calm and loneliness, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, hastens to steal this image that flouts him. His dress became nominated, and he wandered, as often exposed to the n0on-day sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue avoided him. His sister, anxiouf for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His coriduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he lefl by hif ahsence tho all af his friends, with a fiend among them, whose practice they were not connected, he determined to enter society again, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But that he entered a room, his baggard and his suspicious eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was ot lasl forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to instil, arid, fearing that his mind would be wary of the aljené, they thought it was high to regain the trust that had previously been imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDosirouf to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had to encounter in his wanderings, and to prevent him from expasing the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they engaged a physiciari to reside in the husc, and constantly take care of hlm. He hardly appeared to notice, so completely wos the mind obsorbed by a terrible subjeot. His incoherence finally manifested itself so serious, that he was correlated with his chamer. He often lied about bad days, unable to be woken up. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and recollection was manifested at the entrance of his sister; then he was going to begin something, and, sawing his hands ber, wlth looks that were increasingly afflicting him, he wanted not to touch him. \"Ob, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, as was the case, she asked whom it was necessary to answer, her only answer was: \"True! True!\" And agaln sank in a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. This lasted for some mary moriths: however, little by little, as the year passed, hif incoheronces became less frequent, and the mind hjs threw a part of its morosity, while its guardians observed, thclt several times in the day ho count on his fingers a number of firiitis, then smile.\nThe time of Tbe had almost passed, wben, on the last day of the year, one of the bis guards entering the room, began to overwhelm with his doctor on the melancholyclrstance of Aubrey 6eing in such a horrible situation, when bis sister was goirig the next day to be stowed. Instant1y Attrition of Aubrey wcls attracted; he shuddered with anxiety to whom. Happy with this brand of intellectual retumlng, because they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Marsden Eclrl. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubroy seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his exasperation of his intention to be prostent among the nuptiols, and desiring seo bis sister. They did not answer, but by sewing for minutes his sister struck him. Hc was apparently agony able to be attracted by the influence of his pretty smile; if he pressed her to his bravery, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing the thought of his brother his more lively beirige to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with oll his won warmth, and to congratulate her on her marjage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each ccccomp1isbment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the exploits of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He grabbed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under fo0t. On her asking why he tbus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked like If he did not understand her, then taking his hands and looking with a frenzy of countermeasures, he told her to swear that she would marry this monster, because he — but he was able to push the riots forward — it seemed to him that he remembered his oath — he suddenly shook, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the wbole, and bought that it was only a return of bif disorder, overlaid, and the forcing fr0m Miss Auhrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell upon his brothers, and begged, and begged them to delay, but for the day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined had takon's possession of his mind, were striving to paoify him, ond retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the m0rning after the salon, and had been refused wilh all elso. When he heard of Aubrey's disease, b, he understood again to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be felt among those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened at the height of his former companion, and by his attendance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Avrey's rut. What could resist his pagan? His language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of oneself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself;—uuld such as how, as he knew her, his existence, hcld began to seem worthy of preservatiori, except that he could have his aocents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of serperit, or sueh was the wil1 of destiny, that he won his affective. To the title of the falilig elder branch to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take room the day before his departure for the conciliator.\nAubrey, when he was lefl hy the physian on his tutors, tried to bribe the servants, but in uajn. He asked for pen paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjvring ber, as she appreciated her own happinesf, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their h0pe and the hope of their housc, to delay but for a few hovres this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sovants promjsed tbey would have been able to give him the doctor, but when he gave him the doctor, he thought it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. And Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be picked more easily than descrlbed, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and he found carts that shoved his ear. Aubrey grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, gradually leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a connection was hel of the room, and in a mummcnt was in the range where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm 6y, rushed him out of the room, without ardour. Whcn on the stairs, Lord Ruthven groaned in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my wife, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his atlendf, who, awakened by the old w0mon, had come to pick him up. Aubrey couldn't support the loriger.\nWear hiinself; his rage has no shooting vent, had broken cl blood-vessel, it was passed on to your bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was rioting present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nAuhrey's weakness has worsened; the outpouring of blood-produced symploms of the approach to death. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when midnight had passed, he told in a composite way what the reader had pervated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards sought to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was t0o late. Lord Ruthuon had disappeared, and Avbrey's sister had slipped the deepest of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the archipelago of Grecion, aboard one of the ships of his Majefty, in I812, we put lnto the provost of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of rattles and vegetables still to have tbere, lead many British ships to visit it — warmen and merchants; and there is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its bovnties clmpIy repay for tbe deviatiori of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the meri were used to water, and the sacrillier bargajning for the cottle with the tho natiucs, the clergy and myself taok rambled t0 the school of Homer cave, and other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four peas before our arrival in his selucque. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" Greek sidetbe, \"ridden took me with him; bvt I do not have chaos to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird and very good man. The house on the hill, facing the rjver, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gavoDominick, the wirie-trador, six hundred zechins f0r il, (about L250 English currency,) and resided there abaul fourteen months, raugh rioting constantly; so he sa1s in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account greatly exalted the curiosity of the ovary, and we did not waste time hastening from the house that our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old mori, whom he led us on the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a closot space. They were all simply decorated: plain greyi walls, mclrble tab on each side, a large myrtle in Ihe ceritre, and a small fovntaine beneoth, which could be made to play thr0ugh tho branobes by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a bent posture; a sofa or sofa lclrge completed the furniture. In the hall st0od half a dozen English cane chairs, and ari empty library: there was no e...\nThere's no paint. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two quilts of stuffed cotton and a pil1ow – the comm0n bed throughout the Grcoce. In the silting room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, fiiled with books and papers, which were theri in the chest of a great sailor iri the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contrants. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousscau compiete, Volney'sRuins of Empires, Zimmerman, in German Languagc, the Messiah of Klopstook, the novels of Kotzebue, Schiller's play of the Robbers, Milton's Paradise Lost, an Ital-\niari odition, printed in Parma in 1810; leaflets of Severol small from the Greek press al Constantinople, much torri, but was born English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencj1, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, says ho, they must lie there until his return; far he is his particu1ar, that is, if I move a lhing without order, he would frown on Mc for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I made him a servico, and I have products of his farm for the evil of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechlncs which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small ootlage in the wood, and which the Lord has scrambled here from Adrian0ple; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the house of Tbe is very pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps 1ong and wide f0urteen, and the canned marble pillar wjth plintbs black and the freight work cornices, (as it is now usual in the Grocian architecture,) were consideredab1y hibber que tbe raof. The roof, surrounded by a high-height stone balustrade, was wrapped by a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen strrig. Most of the roofs of the house are thus overturned, as on them the Greeks spend their smoking evenings jn, drlnkjng light wines, such as \"lacbryma christi\", eating fruit, and overjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the houso, a srnalI stroamlet glissa, grapes, orangs and lindens were escaped togetber on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" because he was very fervent, and always attached-\nWe finished our churcb twice a week, on Sundays leaps.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called the 6th \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eyc to Mounl Calclo, covered with olive trees and myrtlc trees jn blooin, and a top of which an ancient Greek tempio appeared in majestic rot. A smoll stream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mouvant. The sea smooth as the glass, arid a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ended the view forward; and a 1ittle on the left, through a view of high palm chesriut clnds, several small islands were observed dislinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a ijew more than I did; but our eriquiries were fruitifications as to the narna of the person who had resided in this romantic solitaire: no one knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"but I'm sure he won't do it,\" and can't you do it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details of isolated lord. He had bet young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with him at the bridal sea. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and catton's arid silk to the girls who live there weaving these artioles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, Greek Testaments were often given to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, frowning all that we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstanco we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. Hc had a very valiant daughter, whose lord was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought him a piano-fortée, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the island of Mltylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who could be this logger in Greece. He the obvious inoney wcls: ho ho ho philanthropy disposition, and all these wbich eccentricties brand particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Failling in cornpany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The iridividuel,\" he said, \"that you are so anxious is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him with Mitylene.\" We have never heard of the same seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized the rccluse of CaIcla in every page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea 0f return to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I render this status, helievirig it is not entirely uninteresting, and iri justice in the good name of his seigneury, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to the assemblage of human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as can bo clearly gatbered fred these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of bis Lordship, seem to have tbeir scat in his bosom. Tendress, sympathy and charity cling to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is a reasori sor avenir marking the hiin as a being in whose heart Reljgion put his sea1, clinging to the head of Bible Volunteer has thrown his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Pensions will never be rec...\nIndeed, whoever dares to justify himself before this horrific trial where he must appear, only can censor the errors of another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of genius hjs. Doing good to you in secret, and fleeing the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of the virtuous heart and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prjnter, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "33": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition vpon wbioh this tale is stuffed is very general intho East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: he did not, comment, extend iteIf to the Greeks until after the establishment of the Chrislianity; and he only assumed his present form Siric the division of the Lalin and Greek churohes; at that time, the idea of being dominant, tal a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the sufferect of many stories wondorfvl, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the yovng and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the helif exists, that the vampyres soaked in harm by a certairi part of the blood of the victims of cercir, which emaculated 6th, lost strérigth, and died quickly of consumption; while these oily blood suckers were fattening — and their volunts were distending such a state of reconstitution, as to cluster the b1ood at f1ow of all passages of their bojes, and even of the poros even of their skins.\nIn the Journal Londori of March 1732, is an evrious, and, of course, credible occvnt of a particular case of vampyrism, what would have happened in Modreyga, Hungary. It seems, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and of the judges of thopaea, that they unanimously affirmed, tbat, about live years before, a certain He yduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a uampyre, 6 found a bad way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vomit, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, h0wover, did not prevent hlm from becoming a vainpyro hefelf; sor, about twenty or thirty days after bis death and burial, mony people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people were deprived of IIfe by his attacks. To avoid new disorders, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, taken the body, and found (as it is supposed to be usual in the coses of vampyrism) fresh, completely free from erupting, and stirring in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. The Havirig evidence was thus obtained, and he resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through the heart and Bady 0f Arnold Paul, where it is reported to hclue also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. This doria, they cut off his head, burned the body of hjs, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the corses of thososos who had already died of vompyism, lost, they should, in turn, become begles on the othcrs who survived larn.\nThe universe1 be1ief so, that a person has sucked hy a vampyro becomes a vampyre hesels, and sucks in his moon.\nChief of bail.\nThis monstrous rod0montade is related to merc, as jt seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations than clny olher intunce that might be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of death penalty for a heinous crime committed by wbilsl in existinc, that dead TB is not only condemned to vampyris, but forced to entrust his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved inost while on earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supp0sition refers to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and hate the land of birth, and suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight dread the flow of life: yet hate the banquet that performeth, that thou shouldest feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, even thy thyself shall be yet exhaled, and knaw the devil for their sire; as thou cursed, cursed hem, Your flowers are wrapped on the stem. But one of them for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best belved of A1l, will bless You with the name of a brother — This word will engulf your heart in flames! But you must damage your task and mingle with the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and let the last glassy look see what freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand without salvation, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the tenderest promise of Shourri Afferiori has been made — but now is supported by the Memorial of your og0ny! But with the best of yourself 6lood will swallow up; your squeaking tool, and Iip of haggard; Tben tracking at your tomb, Ga—and with Gouls and Afrjts rave, until those in horror distance themselves from more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Sotbey Bas also presented in his wild but beautiful paem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the young girl Arclbian Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave in order to torment him, whom she loved better during her existence. Bvt this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, sbe being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocent. The true Tournefort makes a long story in his journeys of sweaty amazing cases af vampyrism, lo which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on the subject thif, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and the illuminating tradilionary narratives of his effects, presented some dissertations learned, tendirig to prove that he is c1assic, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany cvious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added bc; although the preserit may suffice for the limits of a nole, necessarily devoted to exploration, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the orie in mofl general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use mado of in various parts of tho wori d: like Vrocolocha, Vordoulacha, Gou1, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the altending dissipations on a writer L0ndon, a nob1eman appeared to the various parts of the locks of the ton, more remarkable than his rank. Ho looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, he could, by a glance, stifle him, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Thosc, who felt this sense of fear, could not explain from where he stood: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, who, staring on the face of the object, did not begin to penetrate, and with one glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; bul fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every h0use; all wanted to see him, and those who had been acoustomized to the fiole excitemenl, and now felt the boredom weigbt, were begged to have something in their presence capable of engaging their altertlon. In fpjte of the mortal tint of her face, which has never gained a warmer tint, nor of the puff of modesty, nor of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours are beautiful, unavowed by the female hunters to the abandonment of the notorie, who had intended to be wary of his attentions, and to obtain, at least often, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of each monfter in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw the herse1f into her woy, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention:—although unfaithful:—when she stood before him, although her eyes apparently fixed that of her, it seemed that they were not perceived;—even her vnappal impudence was baffled, arid she left the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of the eyes of hjs, there was no tbat the female fex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous wjfe and the innocent donut, while few knew that he was speaking to the females. However, he had the reputation of a grinning torrig; and if she even overcame the dredge of his character of chantulclr, or they were moved by his hatred of vice, he was like delen arn arg these females who boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAbout the same thing, a young man named Avbrey arrived in London: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by the guardians, who, however, their dvty simply your tako cares for his fortune, wbile they abandoned the more importary charge of his mind t0 the subaIterns mercenary ore, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high Romanic feeling of honor and caridure, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with uirtue, and thought that vicc was thrown iri by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: however, the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were so warm, bvt that were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds encase various caloric patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of llfe. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for reasons that, when entering the gay circles, many demothcrs surrounded him, strangling who should describe wilh the least true their larguizing or snoring favorites: the girls at the same time, 6y their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to many false notions of his talents and merit. As he was attached to the romance of his salitary hours, he marveled at finding, that, exoep in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence 0f a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life f0r none of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these uolomas, from which he had formed his study. However, by finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, it was lowered to refine his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above, went through him in his career.\nHe observes it, and the same irresponsibility to form an ideo 0f the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external obiects, than tacit assent to their exislence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine all that flattered it is the prepensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a novel, and determined to observe the progeny of hls foricy, rathcr thari the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid him alteritions, energized so to advance on his opinion, that his presence wos always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the preparation of the notes in—Slreet, realized that ho was out to travel. Desiring to obtain information respeeting this singular character, who, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was time for him to make the tour, while for many genres hcls was deemed necessary lo allow the young to do the same rapid steps jn the career of vice-war ds pvttlng themselvos on an equality with the old, arid not allowing that thom to app oar af so fallen skics, each scandalous intrigues are deserved as subjects of plea or praise, according to the degree of skill they bring to bear them. They agreed: arid Aubrey indifferently mentioned his intentionioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him cl praposal to join him. Flattened by a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he rejoiced at having aceoped him, and in a few days they had passed the circligic waters.\nHlthcrto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthveri, and now he found, tal, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motiuos to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — the lazy, the vagaond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey was able to avoid making remarks, and it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the inissortunes even attending on virtue, that he granted his alms;—tbee was sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve bis wishes, but to allow him to loose himself in his lust, or to finish bim still1 more deeply in his iriquiquity, he was sent away because of charity. However, this is attributed by him to the greater importance of the uicious, which generally prevails over the weakness of the retirement of the virtuous indiggent. There was a circumstance about the char of his Lordship, wbich was even more irnpressed upori his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found thal there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Auhrey was surprised by the apparent avidenoss with whom he sought the centres of all the modelable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known beat his anlagonist, and then he lost even more tuna than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with wbich that he generally looked at society around: there was not, however, if he encountered the eruption young novice, or the luck1ess father of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstracledncss of the wcls spirit set aside, and his eyes sparked more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the mort-de-holf mouse. In every city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the solt ed of a dvngcon, the fate that had attracted him withiri the reach of this fjend; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of speaking of the silent hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play of the thc; but immedally lost, to ruin many, the last guilder whom he had just pulled from the oonvulsive hail of the innocent: this mjght but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, whlch, however, did not coincide with the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved to be ruining all, and did not tend to his own profit; — but he delayed him — for every day he jumped his friend would give bim an opportunity to speculate frankly and openly at hjm; however, this nevcr a Accrred. Lord Rutbven in his car, set in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his hislip; and although Avbrey waf neor the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the tough excitement of wanting vainly to break this mysticism, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the supernatural somothing operance.\nThey came to R0me, and Aubrey, for a time loft seen from his companiori; he left him in the daily assistance on the morbid cirole of a Ilalian countess, while he went in search of the meinoirs of another deserted city alinosl. While ho was so erupted, letters came from En gland, that he opened with a greedy embolism; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guards, the second surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was a bad power in his companion, they seemed to give him a fuffilent reason for the bliss. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and urgod, tbat his character was terribly viciaus, for the possession of irresistible powers of sedvctian, made his ljcentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his charaotor; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victimn, the partner of his guilt, should be yelled at from the pinnocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that the women who had been sought, apparently because of their uirtue, had, from his departure, cast the mask apart, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of their vices to the public view.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous pear on which rcst the eye. He resolved to give him plausible pretoxts to abandon him completely, telling him, in the middle while, to drop him more closely, and to leave no light circumstances pafs by urinoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was cndeavourng t0 work up0n the inexperience of the lady's daugbter of which he frequented the chicfly house. In Itoly, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; ho was therefore obliged to pursue the plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon disclaimed that an asitatlon had been appointed, which ended the most evil in the rujn of an innocent, thovgh tugbt daughter. Losing his time, he entered Lord Ruthven's party, and abrvptly asked him for his intonations about the Icldy, informing him at the same time that lhat hc knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Rulhven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that he hated such an ocasiori; and after having been pressed if he intended to strangle him, only laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wrote o note, to say, that from this storm, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seize other apartments, and calling vpan the lady's mother, informed him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, 6ut also about the character of his Lardship. The assignatjon was prevented. Lord Ruthven riext day simply sent hif servclnt to notice his complete ostent to a separation; bvt has not hjnt no fuspicion of his p1ans having been defiled by Auhrey's interposition.\nHaving lefl Rome, Aubrey heads for Greece, and crosses the peninsula, soon finds himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of O Greek; and soon took care to draw the sad documents of ancient glory on the monuments which, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men anly before the slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many of Ijchen colovred. Under the same r0of as heseIf, there existed a bcing, so beautiful and dolicat, that she could have formed the modol for a painter wanting to pour on the carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too muoh spirit for any oria to think that shc might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced at the top the plain, or the cllong tripod, , we would have thought of the gazelle a poor type of his beauties ; for whom would have baue exchanged his eye , apparently an animated ocular nature , for tbat drowsiness luxurious look of the adapted animal but to the taste of an epic . The light stage of Ionthe aftcri accompanied Avhrey in his search for antiquities, and the ostcn went the uriconscient girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, floating as it was on the wind, to the look of ogre os hiin, who forgot the litters that he came from deciphcred on ari compressed almost erased, in the contemplation of his figure of sylpha. Often, her braids would fall, as she wilted the oron, exhlbit in the ray of Thesun svch delimenting brilliant and quickly discoloring the shades, he could excufe tbe f0rgotfulness of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before vitally importing the appropriate interpretation af passage in Pausanias. But why does the attempt t0 describe charms that are all seen, but not con appreciato?—It was ineriocence, youth, ond waterthy, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stjfling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance in the open plain, painted to him in all the flamboyant colors of the young memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning objects that had obviously made a glittering impression on his mind, brought him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His caress and his apparent belief in what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told Hjm the story of the living vampy, that he had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the following months, his bI0od ran cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe quoted to him the names of old men, who had at last detected theories living between them, after several of their parents and children who had once found themselves marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so jncredule, begged him to rebel against her, if he had, if he had been, reinarked, hat thase who had dared to expel their exislence, always bad evidence given, which forced them to confess, with grief and sorrow, to confess. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror multiplied, by a fairly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time ho wondered about the many coincidences that all tended to excite a belie in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of laromance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English robes, mclrrying a Greek girl unshakeable, still ho found glare1f inore and more attached to the form of a fairy the most a1 before him. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plan for the sumptuous antiquarian search, he left, determined not to return untjl his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruiris around him, which is in his mind he kept a tbat image seemed alone the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was aware of his love, and was still the same child he had Sirst Crown. She always seemed to break up with her with reluctance; 6but it was no longer a case where she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragmenl that was still escaping from the destructive hand of tiine. She had appealed to out-of-parent parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which was t0 holding hjm for a few hares; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to return to nht, for it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever stay, after the day had closed, to any consideration whatsoever. They dethroned it as the kind of vampyte in the noctumal orgies, and den0unced the rnost of heavy evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their poth. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to bring them out of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so that you mocked a superior, infernal pagan whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next day, Mornirig Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy of his host, and he was concerned that his words, mocking the bellif of the terrible fiends of the pipe, had inspired them to such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to come back, and the night of the ore allowed the power of these fools to be put into action; — he promised. He cared so much about his reverence, that he did not perceive the light of day, and that on the horizon tbere was 0ne of these wbich specks, iri the warmer climate, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country.—He, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: bul it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm wos ahoue — its thunders echoed barely an intervcl1 of rest — its heavy thick rain pierced its woy through the foliage of the cover, while the forked lightning hlvc seemed to fall and radiate to its very effect. Sudden1y his horse took straight, arid it was carried with dreadfvl fast through the entangled forest. The animal stopped, the fatigue stopped, and he began to four, by the glare of the glare, and he was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brvshwood that surrounded him. Dlsmount, he approached, hoping to find some 0ne to guide bim to the towri, or at least trust to get a shelter from the awning basin. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman mingling with the suffocating and exulting ridicule of a laughter, contrived the almast with an uninterrupted sound; — he was surprised; but, awakened by the thunder, he gave Ovor's head again, with a sudden force, sorcered, opened the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sovnd, the Howevor, guided him. He is apparently inconceivable; for although he collided, the sounds continued, and nothing was made of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Again gagged!\" to whom a strong fern felt harassed by him whose strength seized superhumans: determined to give himself his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vain: be lifted up fr0m hjs fet and thrown with enormous force against the ground: — his cnemy fell upon him, and knelt on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat bis — when he dazzling many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, troubled him; — he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in cllomenl the crushing of the branches, as he broke the wood, wcls did not hear him any more. The storm is now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon bearded by those without. They entered, and the light of their tears fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on all the iridividous straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's will, they went to the sea for the one who had attracted him with his cries; he was again Ift to dclrknesf; but what was his horror, that the light of the torches once moro burst upon him, los perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor hroughtiri a corse without life. He shvl hisoyes, hopirig tbal it was only a vision that became clear from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, collapsed on the bis side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a buttock on his face that seemed to be as attached as the lily that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, on his thraat were the marks of teeth that opened the vein: — to this men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A vampire! o Vampyre!\" A litter box was formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant visions and sadjry, now fallen with the flower life that had died in her. He did not know what he had bought, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held unconsciously in his hand a naked dclgger a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties wbo had boen engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, signaled the traps of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grid would be impossible; bvt when they determined the cause of their child's death,\" he looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconspicuous; both died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violet fever, and was often delirious; in the inlervals of lhesc he called Lord Ruthven and up0n Ianthe—6y some incompetent combinolion he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the care he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, blessed at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from any moljve, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant servant. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrifiod and astonished at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, hy his kirid words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and stll more by the atlention, anxiety, and ear that he showed, soon the reconcilod lo hjs presence. His lordsbip seemed completely changed; he no longer seemed to be apothetic when Aubrey was so ostensible; but, as soon as his oantvaloscence was fast, he gradually hung himself in the same state of mind again, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his staring intolerantly fixed on him, with a smile of maliciovs exultation playing on his ljps: he did not know why, but this smile had him. During the most difficult stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged to look at the tideless wave raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, llke our world, the still sun;—iride, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by the shock tbis, wos mvch weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had oncc so distinguished it now seemed to have fled to have had. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but as long as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athons; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, Ianthe's shape stood by his side – if he sought him in the vagabonds, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the purple of the modosta; he turned suddenly, showing, his wild imagination, his palc face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile lovating his lips. He determined to steal scenes, characteristic of the euphoria that such associations created in his mind to bltler. He proposed to Lord Rutbuen, who is bound by the care he took of him during his illness, to visit these parts of Greece, and yot had not seen. They traveled to all the regions, and looked for all the places that could have been attached to a complication; but although they were thus removed from the square, they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They have a lot of thieves, but they have gradually begun to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the inventiveness of individuals, wbose interefet was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result of this denial of local council, they occasionally travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. However, by seizing a narrow challenge, to the botlom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they were right to repent of their neglectico; for they were hardly the whole party arose in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the beating of c1ofe bullets at their head, arid by the cchocd ratio of several gvns. Iri for a moment their guards had left them, and, standing behind the r0cks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, in imitating the example, withdrew for a moment behind the aprijng tower of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting basins sade thcm advance, arid being exposed to inflammation without resemblance, if any 0f thugs should c1imb above and toggle tbem at the rear, they immediately decided to rush forward in search of the enemy. Barely a bad tbey lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shol in tobe shouldor, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, is surprised to see the thieves' faculties abort him, his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately thrown their arms and surrendered.\nBy the promises of a great resp...\nAubrey soon pushed them to conuey hls wurid fried lo a neighhouring eclhin; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence thoir—thcy simply keeping the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthvcn quickly diminished; two days of mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His arid appearance had not changed; hc seemed as incorruptible of the pain as he had been objects around him; but towards the O ose de tho last night, his mind became apparently unbreakable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, which was induced for his asjstanco with more than serious usuae—\"Help me! I mean not my life, I've listened to Rny's death as little as that of the day passing; but you can save iny h0nour, the honaur of Yaur friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little of my life flourishes, I can't explain everything — bvl if you hide a1l You know of me, my honor has freed itself from the stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rasirig himself with exulting violene, \"Swear by all your soul that, by your naturc fears, swear that, for a dry year a day, you will not give to every living being on the way, whatever it is, or what you see, my crimes or my death. \"His eyes seemed energizing from their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, and did not breathe a mare.\nAubrey withdrew to roam, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose in the spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oclth, a cold frenzy came upon him, oss if the presentation of something horrible awaited him. From the beginning of the snoring, he was abaut lo enter into the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, arid informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself and omrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they had gjven hls seigneuria, that he had exposed himself to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after death bis. Avbrey is astonished, and takes the men's covers, decided to go and bury him on the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found the trace of the body or clothes, although the robbers swore that they had revealed the same rock on which he had laid the body. For some time, the spirit bis was perplexed jn oorijcctures, but to be to lasl returned, convinced that Thoy had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWearing a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appearedryly conspired to pretend this superstitious melancholy which had sejected himself on min d, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied the helsels iri by arranging the effects he occupied with him belonging to Lard Rvthven. In other cases, there is one case of corruption and several cases of offence, more or less adopted to ensure the victim's mourning. There were several daggers and atagharis. While turning them around and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sbeat ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the big hut — he trembled — hastening to get other proos, ho found the weclpan, and his horror can be imagined wben he covered that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on the haft and the sheath were similar in the splondour on both, and did not leave any rooin sore; tbere were drops of blood alsa on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the way home, in Rome, his first investigations were on the lady he had tried to remove attractive arts from Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distros, their forturia ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had falsified a victim at the Iantho destroyer. He bocamed inorose and silent; and his onIy oecupatiori consisted of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the liso of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which began to obey his will, soon tumbled him on the English coasts; and he hastened to the rnansion of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri the embracos and caresses of his sister, ail memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, had gained its effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an acoinpanion.\nMiss Auhrey didn't just win thanks wbich wins the ga2e and applcluse of drawing-roin assemblage. There was none of this light shine that normally exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. Thore was a melancholic charm around him that did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some expense1 inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter recllm. His step was not that the foot, which strays where to er a butterfly or o color can attract – it was sedate and pcnsive. When Alonc, his caress was never grieved by the smile of joy; but when the brother ecr watered his affection to her, and in his presence would have forgotten these deed sbe could destroy his rest, what would his smile have exchanged for that of voluptuous tbe? It seemed that these eyes, this fae then played in the light of our own native sphere. Shc was only eighteen years old, and had not introduced Bcen to the world, he was thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation if he tarried until the retvrn of his brother of the coritinate, when he could be his protector. It was now, in this sense, that the noxt salon, which was quickly opposed, was to be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". He would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and fed on the mclancboly that oerpowered hlin. He could not feel interested in the offashionable strangler frivolous, when his mind had so torn the events that he had seen; vvt he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They came to Lownn, and prepared for the next day, which had announced 6th as a salon.\nThe crowd was exees5 – a drawing-ro0m had not been held in a long time, arid all those who were impatient with bosk in the kingdom smllo, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he stood in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, engaged in the remorse that the first timo he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that place where the urn was, he suddenly felt him sequestered by the arrn, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear, \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage for turri, eager to see a spectre blow to him, when he was perceived, within a short distance, the same figure that had drawn the attention of the hjs on this point until his first entry into society. Ho looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, arid was taken home. He grabbed a piece of tbe with pressed steps, and he put his hands on a layer of bis, as if he were afraid his kicks would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—cjrcumstances started in the terrible farniente—the dagger—the oath bis.—He shaved itIf, ho could not the bclieve possible—the death rose agajn!—He thought his imagination had conj-\nured vp the image on which his mind leaned. It was impresible that it could be real — so he determined to go back to society; for, although he had enslaved Lord Ruthven, the riame hvng on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining lnformation. He left a few nights later, his sister at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Perceivirig, finally, whom many were leaving, he awakened, and when entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; hc attempted to pass and approach her, when the one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and dragged him these traits that he most abhorred. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a foot-to-foot in a hurry, he set her on the street; and when he began to stand by the multitude of servants, he waited for the lords of the LORD; and while he was committed to pass over them, he heard this voice murmur with him again, saying, \"Remember your oath!\", he dared not turn, but, hurry up his sister, he soon came to his house.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before the hif mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more complete was it grosso d, now than the certainty of the life of the monster once again pressed on his purchases. Her sister's attraction was no longer listened to, and it was in vairi thclt that she intimidated him to send to her wbat had causod hift led abruptly. Ho said only a few words, and thase terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oats surprised him;—was he then to allow this monstor to gratify, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all being endured, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if he wanted to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from evil; but death, he remembered, had already mocked beeri. For days he remained in his condition; locked in his room, he saw no one, and clinged to it only when his sist or came, only with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, his sake, to sustain nature. Finally, no danger able to carry still1ncss and loneliness, he raised his house, wandered fr0m strect t0 street, anxious to steal this image that disturbs him. His dress became neglected, and he prepared, as often exposed to the sun of the day of Naon as to the humidity of the midnigbt. He was no longer to be recognized; at the fjrst he returned with envy to the house; but at last he put him at dawn to rest where Fatjgue had invaded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to sabotage him; but they were soon removed by him who fled a pursuer faster than any thought. His coriduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he Ieft by his absence he all his friends, with a fiend among them, of the trick that they were unconscious, he determined lo to enter again into socly, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, jn despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he was entered into a room, his rogue and svspicious eyes were so dreadful, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that touched the hjm so much. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakable, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene and, fearing that his mind would rejoice, they took the time to take back the trvst that Aubrey's parents had imposed on them.\nDesiring to save the bim from the wounds and sufferings that we have had every day in the wanderings, and to make it pass from expassion to the geriatric eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, thoy hires a doctor to stay in the house, and takes care of him. He was not afraid to notice it, so that competently was his mjnd absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great, that ho was confined to his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a vitreous Iuster; — the odious sign of affection and of the remaining recollection was manifested on the entrance of the bis sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, her only waf answer, \"True! True!\" And once again he sank in a state, wbencc not even she could wake him up. In recent months: however, little by little, if the ycar passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and the bis spirit threw a part of its morosity, while his guards observed, which he counted once in the day on his fingers a certain number, then smie.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of being Aubrey ln so terrible o sutuation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Instant1y Aubrey's attentist was coupled; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this intelIcct return mark, which they feared had been deprived of, they mounted the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that the tbis was a young count he met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them more by expressing his intention to be present at tbe nuptials, arid wanting to separate from his sister. They did not answer, but in an instant his father was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and klssed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the idea that his brother was once again to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to oongratulate ber on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on his chest; 0 for what a surprise to see the characteristics of this monster that has influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why to be so despised the resemblance of his future Husbclnd, he looked at cls if he rioted without clasping her — by grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression of face, he swore that she would not marry this monster, for he — but hc could not move forward — it seemed that this voice shouted again to mereinber his oath — he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In addition, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, attached themselves to the fact that it was only a return of his disorder, entered, arid for having fooled Miss Aubrey, desired that she release him. He fell on his knees as far as TBem, implored, begged them to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the soundlessness they imagined, took possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Rutbven had elated in the morning after the living room, and bcen had refused with evory another. When one heard of Aubrey's ill health, he could not be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be inferred from those among whom he had obtained his information. He hastened to the housc of the former companion, and, through the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, hc gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who would resist his power? His tongue had dangers on the toils to tell—could speak like himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except wilh herto wham whom he addressed to him1s;—could say how, since he knew her, his cxistence, had begun to seem worthy of precrvation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents;—well, he knew well how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch falling to him at Lengtb, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excvse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take plccce the very day of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the pbysjcian and his guards, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to hjs fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the grave, who orice her held her in their arms as their boop and the boop of their h0use, to delay but for a few hours thal marrlage, on which ho denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver JT; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Mifs Aubrey's spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily concejved than described, the notes of occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the discovery of cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vivacity, they gradually stole, leaving him the guard of an old woman powerless. He drunk the occasion, with a tied was out of the room, and in a moment smiled in the acclrtment that all were almost assembled. L0th Ruthven was the first to set him up; he heard immediacy, and, throwing his arm by the witch, he rushed him into the room, and cried furiously. On the stairs, Lord Rutbvcn rang his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know that if my bride is not today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his companions, and the old woman pushed him into fear. Aubrey could support himself longer; his rage had no running vent, had broken a uossel blood, arid he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to bis sister, who was not present when hc entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake it. The wedding was so...\nThe bride and husband left L0ndon.\nAubrey's weakness increases; the blood efrusjon produces symlomas of the riary approach to death. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, arid when midnight had passed, he would tell in a composite way what the reader had hit, he died immediately after.\nThe gvardians quickly protected Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and the slster of Aubrey had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was everyone asked him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN A sail across the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 18l2, we pvt inlo the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this plateau, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always t0 be there, lead many British vossels to visit it — both warmen and merchants; arid though it is out of the lrack for ships linked to Smyrna, his bountief ainply repay for the deviation of the voyage of cl. We landed, as usual, at the beluga of the Bcly, and while the men were employed to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Sclo with an English lard, wbo left the ifland four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have takon ine with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 Eng1ish currency,) and resided there about fourteenmontbs, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the different iflands.\"\nThis account aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time seeing the nozzle that our compatriot lived in. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: a living room, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet. They were all picked up in mermaid: green walls of pIclin, marble tables on the side, a largc myrtle iri the center, and a small fountain below, which cuvld play t0 through the branches by making the masonry of a spring fixed in the side of a sinall bronzo Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty library: the gorges were mirrors na, nora a single painting. The litter had only one large mattress that extended the flor0r, with two stuffed cotton duvets and one pillow, the most common in Greece. In the living room we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled wjth books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was opera, but we did not think ourselves justified by examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerinan, iri the German language; Klopstock'f Messias; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Lost's Paradise, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the pamphlets of the Greek press from Tbe to Constanlin0ple, much tom, but no English boak of any description. Most of these b0oks were marked with noles margirials, written with a penci1, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scratched everywhere, clnd marked wilh briefs of paper, on whooh were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read the books of theevenjng before he sailed, and forgoled to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I move the thing without order, it would frown upon me for the week lodger; it is in other very good ways. I have one day done a service; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, excepl twenty zechins whom I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cottogc evil1 in the wood, and which the Lord brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know for reason of war.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now eustomary in Greek architecture,) were considered higher than the ro0s. The roof, topped by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful Turkish carpet, under a golden linen awning. Most of the house roofs are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pass their enrigs by smoking, drinking light wines, like \"1achryma christi\", eating fruit, arid while enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left-hand harid, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, orariges and lime trees gathered together on his barders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seat was placed with an ornamental wood back, and we were told that the first mary of his evenings and years was spent until twelve o'clock, rescuing, writing and speaking thus himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, praying, \"for he was very fervent, and always attended hur churcb twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe uiew brake this waf seat which can be called \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, scattered with 0 life and myrtle trecs in flowers, and on the top of which an ancient Greok temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until the woods were lost near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as bright, and ari h0rizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, termiriatef the vjew in front; and a little on the left, thrugb a vista of high chiefnue and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the blue wave ligbt with spots of emeric green. I rarely had a view more than I did; but our investigations were without results as the name of the person who had lived in this romantic salitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeniani,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't say it,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city we learned several details of the isolatodic lord. He had a porlioncd eight young girls when he was the last vpon of the island, and even danced with them at the bridal sea. He gave the cow to a man, the horses to the athers, and the ton of bed and silk to the daughters who live by weaving articles of tbees. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In sb0rl, have we appeared, from all that we have collected, to hclve has been an eccentric and benevolent uery character. A circumstance that we have learned, which ovr old friend to the oottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking by the sea, and who had been bought a piano-strong, and who had been taught to use it himself.\nSuch information with whicb we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philantbropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular genjus. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling with Mr. FOSTER, the archicotcot, a WYATT'S puppy, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, \"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byrori; I greet him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I visit him in Mitylene.\" We then had to be the first of the fame of the seigneury bis, as we had been some of them from the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus Calclcl bone in each page. Didn't we regret not having been more meritorious in our reservists at the cottage, bul we were able to solve our Ives with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day wjll never returned. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in juvstice to the good dwarf of her seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as a dispositiori ari insensitive, opposed to assoiating with the Buinian riature, or contributing in any way to soothe its pains, or to add its folds. The fact is directly inverse, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness, the rest of solitude, is an additional rossard to mark him as a being upon whose heart the Religion halh sela his sole, and upon whose pearl the Benevolence cast his coat. No man has read the preceding \"traits\" without feeling...\nHe's proud of him as Ountryman. With rospcct to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with water, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself seizes the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byrori's cabaraeter so worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, arid fills the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "34": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this story is smiling is uery general jn the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, he did not extend his sons to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he assumed his present somme only from thc divisjon of the Latin and Greek Churcbes; at that time, the idea being predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were enraged in the territory of Ihera, he gradually increased, and formed the subject of many stories of woridersul, still existing, of dead thc rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and 6eautiful. In the West, it extended, with seeds of variati0n, alI on Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where there was the belief, that the vompyres nightly imbibeda cortain portion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and specifically died of consumption; while the human blood suckers fattened it — and their veins became distended to a state of repletion, as for cavfe the flow of blood ta from all passages of their body, and even from the pores vcry of their skins.\nIri the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curiovs, and, from covrsus, credible account of a case of particular os uampyrism, wbich is called to hclve took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they declared pofitivcly and unanimously, lhat, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, hod bcen heord to say, that, in Cossevja, ori therontiers of the Turkish varia in Tbc, it was bad was tormented by a vampy, hut had found a way to get rid of evil, eat part of the earth from the tomb of the vampy, and rub with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming an illf vampy; for, 6 out of twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of the hauirig beaked by him, and a statement was made, that four evil pers0ns were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the hody, found clnd (as it is supposed to be usuaI in case of vampyrism) fresh, clnd completely free of corruption, and emitting al tbo inouth, nose, and ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was obtained, they resolved to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Paul's breast and body, where he would have cried as terribly as if he had been aif. It's done, they cut off his pearl, burned hjs bady, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with tbe corses of the person who had previovsly died of vampyrism, let them, in their tum, become agents on others who survived them.\nEuropean Union\nversail belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre beomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThe monstrous thjs rodomontode here is bound, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the observations presenl than any other instance that could be produced. Iri of many ports of Greece it is considered a kind of punishment after the case, for heinous crimes care combined while in existenee, that dead babe is not only sentenced to vampyrise, but forced to limit her infernal visits only to those beings that he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first on earth, Vampyre keys sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre; and when thou hast haunted the place of origin, and sucked the blood of all thy sap: there shall thy davghter, sister, wife, shall be broken, about midnight drain the stream of life: yet hate the banquet that is to strike thy livid the corsc ivirig, the victims of Tby, and they shall perish again, and Shal1 know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But the one who, for your crime, must fall, Thc the youngest, the best blind of all, Diffuse with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last cloth of his cbeek — the 1st spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless bluo; then, with a bare hand, will tear the braids of his ellow hair, including, in the face, a lock when the most tender pledge of affection has been worn — but now you are carried 6y Memorial of your agony! Yel with thy awri the best blood shall flow; thy grafting tooth, and the lip of the hook; and hunting at thy tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in the horror of the shririk far from the cursed specter than thcy.\nMr. Southoy also presented in his wild and majestic poem of \"Tha1aba\", the vampyrecorse of the good Arabic tho Oneiza, which is represented by bones having rendered the grave fram for the priest to torment him whom she loved during her existence. But this cannot be pleased to have been the result of the sin of her first, being poured out throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tovrnefort gjves in Iong counts in his travels several astonlshirig cases of vampyrism, to which ho claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work up to 0n tbis subject, besides a variety of anecd0tes bones, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, low has presented some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to explanatjon, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that tovgh tbe term Vampyrejs that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, made usc in various parts of the tho world: cls Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the accompanying dissjpations vpon a London winner, he appeared to the various parties of tho leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the glamour around him, for he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew only attention, which he sighed with a look, will fade out, and cast fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. From where this sense of fear arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, extending on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pieree lhraugh to the inner work of the heart; 6ut fell on the check with a radius of lead that weighed on the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; the anvil wised to pay him, and those who were accustomed to violating the excitement, and now felt Erinui's weight, were happy to have something in their hairy presence to age their attentiontiori. In spite of the deadly tint of her faee, which nevor gairi a warmer tint, eitber of lho blush of modesty, or of the strong emolion of passlon, although her beautiful clrid contour wero, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to win, at the leost, some marks of what they might call the affliction: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster worn in the drawing rooms from her rnarrioge, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a moonbank, to attract her attention:—although in ualn:—when she stood before bim, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived;—even her unapplied impudence was flouted, and she left the field tho. But the common adulterer could not infuse even the direction of her eyes, it was not tbat the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he sp0ke to the virtuous woman arid innocent girl, that few ever knew that he added bimsolf to the women. However, he had the reputation of a winning torigue; and that he was even too dreaded by the bis-singular character, ar that lhey was moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like howteri among the female hosc who form the boast of the sex of these uirtu domestics, as among those whom he shoves by their vices.\nAt about the same time he arrived in London a young man named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great sweath, by parents who diod while he was still in childh0ad. Bequeathed also to himself by guards, who thought it was their duty simply to care for his fortune, while they abandoned the most important shade of his mind to take care of subaltem mercenaries, to be cultivated more his imagination than his judgmenl. He therefore had a sense of honor and romantic frankness thal higb, which destroys every day so many learnings of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice of lbat was thrown by Pretoria simply for the pictvresque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but whlch were better suited to the eye of the palriteur by their irregular folds and vorious coloured spots. He thought, well, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and rich: for the same reasons, he entered the gay circles, the marrying mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least trulh their languishing or blushing favors: at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he clpproachcd, and by their dazzling eyes, when he opened his lips, he soon led him into false notions of his talent and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the candles ta1low and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, bul srom lacks snuffing, there was n0 fovndation in real life for one of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was abovt of relinqvish his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through it in his career.\nHe struck him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man who was absorbing himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit ascendant to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: searching the imagination to imagine all that flattered his proponity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the outpouring of his fclncy, rather tban the person in front of him. He has become familiar with HLM, has paid attention to it, and so far has put forward his opinion, that his presence is still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's afsairf was embarrassed, and soon found, from the notos of preparation in — Street, that he was about t0 journey. Desiring to obtain information about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was late for him to make the tour, wbich for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps jn the career of vice towclrds putting themselvos upori an equality with lhe oged, and not allowing lhem to appear as if fallen from the sklef, scandalous whiriever intrigues are mentioned as the sub-jecls of the pleasant or os praise, according to your degreo of the skill that he had to bear on them. They agreed: and Avbrey immediately evoked his intentions t0 Lord Ruthven, was surprised to report a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a csteem mark of him, who apparently had not hirig in common with other mcn, he rejoiced to accept it, and in a few days they passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to see the character of Lord Ruthven stvdyirig, and we find it now, that, many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, tbe reflections offered different conclusions from the motives applause his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagabond, and beggar, rocked with his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could riot to avoid noticing, that he was not on the virtuous, repugnant to indignation by the wealthy who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he was lowering his alms; — these were sent out of the door with barely repressed fnoers; but he who profligated him omc to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to plunge him deep into his iniquity, he was sent away with ricb charity. It was, h0wever, attributed by him to the greatest iinportunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the absenteeism of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was more stifled his mind: every lhose on which he was best placed, inevitably made himself known that there was a curse on her, so they were all either lcd t0 scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and the most abiect misery. In Brussels and in the cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which the companion sought the centres of all fachlonable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: hc betted, and always played successfully, except where tho known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he lost evon more than he gcliné; but he always had the same face unchangjng, with which he generally looked at the arourid society: This is not the case, however, when he launched the young novice eruption, or the unlucky foetus of a large family; theri his even wish shone the law of fortune — this apparent obstinacy of the mind was apart, and his eye lit more fire than that of the cat while untangled with the mouse half shredded. In every city, he left the old easy youth, lom of the cjrcle which he looked, cursed, in the s0litude of a dungeon, the lhat spell had drawn him into the tho rkach of this end; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the talking airs of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his 1at immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present need. However, he did not take money from the table of play; immediately lost bul, to the ruiner of rnany, the last guilder whom he had ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bul might is the refusal of a certain degree of knowledge1, which was not, commentevcr, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his sierid, and begged him to reshuffle this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own profjt; — but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, waf always the same: his eye spoke of the levets than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratifying gratification from him The excitement of the valley wanting to break this mystery, which to its exalted imagination began to assume the enthusiasm of something supernatural.\nTbey soon arrived in Rame, and Aubrcy, for the last time, saw his cornpclnion; he left him sitting daily on the morning circle of an Italian countess, as he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wbilst thus committed himself, letters came from England, which he opened eagerly impatienced wilh; the first was frowning his sister, breathed nothing of hut affection; the others were guardians, the latter surprised him; if she had before entering into her jmagination that there was an evil power residing in her companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. Hif Gardlans insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and urged, tbal his baracter was a vicious draconian, because the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made his licensive habits more dangerous.\nYes. It had been discovered, that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but he had demanded, ensnaring his gratification, that his life, the associate of his vile, be torn from the epineum of undefiled virtue, to the lowest a6yss of infamy and degradation: in Siria, that the females whom he had sought, appearilly because of their uirlue, hcld, since his departure, even threw the mask aside, and had not rescued to expose all the deformity of the vices due to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on Ieaving one, whose choraoter had not yet shown a single luminous pojrit on whlch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a pretext of plauslble to abandon him altogelher, in order, in the middle wbile, to monitor him more closely, and to leave no sligbt circumstonoes pclss unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly frequented at home. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to take care of her plans in the dryland; but Avbrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the rvin of an innocent girl, a girl without thought. He entered Lord Ruthven's apartment and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of the healthy that he knew he was there to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he thought that all would have an opportunity on Suoh; and vpon being in a hurry that he intended to marry him, was content to laugh. Aubrey withdrew, and immediately, writing, to say, that from lhat m oment, he had to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their project, he ordered his servant to sow other opartments, and to piss him off on the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only about him, but also about the character of his Lordsbip. Tbe's transfer was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven sent his servant to warn his camplet of a separation; but the riots revealed that his plans had been forged by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon sounded in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; ond saon 0cupied by tracing tbe fed reeordf of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the s1aves, had hidden under the scaly ground or many colored lees. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, so heautiful and delicate, tbot could have formed the model of a painter cl wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of faithful tbe into Mohammed's poradis, except that the hcr eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the real mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for who would have excubated her eye, apparently the animated eye of nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted bul to the taste of an epic. The long stage of Ianthe Osten accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities aster, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of the Berber form, floating as jt were on the wind tho, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he came from deciphcred on a tahlet almost erased, in contemplation of the figure of ber sylph-like. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun sucb delicatcly bri and erasing the hues, he might well excivate the forgnitude of the antiquarian, who let escape from his spirit tbe object even that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why want to describe charms that everyone feels, but laughs can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, not infected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. When he drew these remains, he wanted to keep an inemorial for his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of his penci1, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described to him the dance circllng on the open plain, he painted, to him in all the brilliant covers of the young memory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having looked at in her childhood; and then, turning to the sub-jocts thal hcld cvidently made a greater impressionjon on the spirit of ber, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His fervour and apprehension aroused the very interest of Aubrey; often he tries to tell him the story of the vampy that had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the ties of dorcst, witched every year, by looking at the life of a beautiful semal your prolorig his existence for months, his blood was cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted the names of the old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of their close relatives and children had been found marteled by the stamp of the fiancé's appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe, for it was noticed, that those who dare not question their existence, always had evidence that found them unbelievable, with pain and tear, to confess it. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of the TBEFE monsters, her horror increased, listening to a fairly precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he continued to persuadirig her, there could not be truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a be1ief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey Bogan attached him more and more to Ianthe; his iriocence, f0 contrasted with all the virtues uttered by the women omong that he had sought out his vision of romance, gained his heart; and while he was cunning the idea of a young man of the habits Englisb, marrying a Greek girl without education, he was still more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-Qvarian research, he went away, decided not to return until his object was reached; hut he always found impossible the t0 to fix his attentioniori on the ruins around bim, while in his mind he retained a tbat image alone the rightsulpossefsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious 0f his love, and was always the same infant frik bejng having first kriown. She always seemed hesitant; it was because she no longer had one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragmenl who had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parenles on the vampyres of fobject af, and they hoth, with severcl1 present, the existence afflrmed thcir, pale with h0rror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they saw the name of the place, they all begged not to resum at night, for he had to necessarily pass through a wad, where no Greek would ever remain, after tho day, to any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the inost of heavy ovils as depending on who dared to cross the path. Avbrey made the light of his rehearsals, and tried to brighten them with the aid; but when he saw them trembling with his audacity to mock a superiar, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrcy left on his unattended excursion; be surprised to observe the rnelanchole face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible siends, had inspired this kind of terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe oame on the side of his horse, and sincerely prayed to him to turn, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. He was, however, so busy in his resaareh, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in warmer climates, quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted land.—He finally chewed his horse, however, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is of almasl unkn0wn; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it had od advanced far, the powor of lbe st0rm was abouous — its thunders failed hardly had a lnterval of rest — its heavy rain forced its passage through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked lightning blue tbe seemed to fall and radiate its feet. Suddenly his horse looks scared, and he was wrapped with dreadfvl rushed through the tangled forest. The anjmcll at 1 ast, the fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the mass of the dead leaves and the wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that t0 would find a little sound to guide HLM toowri, or leclst trustjng to get a shelter against the storm basin. As he approached, the thvriders, for a silent moment, let him raise the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocated mockery, exutories of a lough, continuous in an almost uninterrupted sound;—he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was still rolling his head, he, with an effort of svdden, forced the opening of the basket of the hut. He identified himself in the total darkness: the noise, the moaning, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds continued, and no attention was taken from him. He found himself undisputed by the fome, who, in himself, immoderately seized himself; when a voice cried out, \"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laughter took hold; and felt afflicted by him whose strength seemed superhuman: dissuaded from selling his life as derisory as he could, he bowed his hands in vain; he rose from his feet and rushed down with a huge force on the ground: — his enemy threw bjmself on his back, and knelt on his pike, and rose his hands up at the top of his throat — when the brightness of mclny lorches penetrated through the hole that gave ligbtin the day, disturbing him; — he rose up instantly, inflamed himself, leaving the prey hjs, rolled through the door, and in a storm the crushing of the bracbes, as it was understood through the wood. The storm was still there, and Aubrey, incapablo os moving, was soon hea rd by those without. They erod; the light of the drags of Jr fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the desire of Aubroy, they sought her who had attracted him to his thunderstorms; he was again left in the darkness; but what was the horror, which the light of the t0rches burst once again upon him, to pierce the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a lifeless c0rse. He shakes his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from disturbed bis ininagination; but he sees again the same form, when he closed lhem, lying at his side. There was no colour above the cheek, not even above his lip; yet there was a dizziness of his face which seemed almost as attached as life once there was: — on his neok and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein: — to this, the men pointed, wept, mixed with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A bitter first was adorned, and Aubrey waf laid by the side of the one who was badly 1ately to him the object of so mary brigbt and the sairy vsions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mirid was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, to take refuge in the vacancy — he almost unconsciously held in his hand a dagger riaked 0f a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search 0f her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated the parents of a terrible catastrophe. —To describe the child's pain would be impossible; bul when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the car. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized by a violent moft fever, and was often delirious; in these iritervals, he called on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a careful and incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former Empire to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on the bis's head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, lucky this time to arrive at Athenf, and, for whatever reason, on the bearirig of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constent awaits. When he recovered from the bis delirlum, he was horrified and amazed at the sight of him who had this image that he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separtiori, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and gripping care that he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite carige; he no longer seemed to be apathetic thal who had subtitled Aubrey; but, as soon as his bcgan evalesceress was quick, he gradually withdrew into the same spirit, and Avbrey did not see any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to grind his carefully fixed look on him, with a malicious exultation smile playing on his lips: he kncw rioted why, hut this smile haunted. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Rulbven was apparently committed to looking at the tides raised by the cold breeze, or iri mclrking the progress of the th0se orbs, surrounded, like our world, the sun without purple;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once disturbed him so much now seemed to have run away from afar. He is now as in love with solitude and silence as the Lord Rvthven; he has as much as solitude, his spirit could not have sinned in the quarter of Athens; if he saw him as amjdst that he had been poorly frequented before, the form of Ianthe was swallowed by him – if he trampled her in the woods, his light would stop appearing wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly turning around, to his wild imagination, his pale, arid face wounded his throat, with a sweet smile on his ber lips. He determined the scenes, each seam of which created in his mind such associations of bjtter. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the care he had taken from his illness, that they had caused them to visit these parts of Greece and that they had not yet seen. They passed in all directions, and looked for all the places where a recollic could be attached; but, although they were so stunned from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what lhey was looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result, by neglecting the advice of the inhabilanls, they occasionally travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the 6ottom of whjch was the bed of a torrenl, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, thcy had reasori lo lo repentant of their neglect; for hardly was the wbole of the party engaged in the pass of Nclrrow, when he was surprised by the whistle af bvllets near their head, and by the report echoes of scverol rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, arid, behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, Imitatlng their examination, retired for a moment behind the beirig-like turn of defilement: but shameful of beirig thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries bale lhem advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they deterred both rufh forward in search of the enemy. They had little shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot from the shoulder iri, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the canteen or his own peril, one soon surprises by seeing the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, vpon Lord Rvthven is wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrenders.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his friend wouri ded to a nearby hut; and havjng invited him to a ransom, he no longer forced themselves by their presence — they were merely coritants to keep the entrance until the comrade tbeir could return with the promised sum, so that he had ordered. Lord Ruthven's strength was rapidly decreasing; within two days the martification followed, and death seemed to progress with rushing gusts. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious as he had been; but towards the end of the last evening his mind was apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often attached to Aubrey, who was indignant to offer his help with more serious vsual — \"Help me! You can save Mc – you can do more than that – I don't moan my life, I pay attention to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but yov can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey replied. \"I need, but few things — my life flourishes — I carinat explains everything — but if y0u hid everything you know of me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of war1d — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the thorylng man, raising him up with exultant violence, \"Swear by every Yovr soul roaming, out of fear of the Yaurus nature, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or of the death of any living being, in any way whatsoever, or of what you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their fockots: \"I swear!\" sald Aubrey; he ridiculed himself in his stake, and he no longer breathed.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attributing his knowledge that this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he swore a chilling cold camo on him, as if the presentation of something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had put the body, when a thief met him, and irritated him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a mountain of nejghbouring, ancestor to a promlse which they had given to his seigneury, which he had to expose to the first cold ray of tho moon which r0se after his dowry. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several men, determined to bury him on the spot where he is. But when he went up to the top, he did not have a traoe of Tbe carpfe or Ibe's clothes, although the thieves swore that toy drew attention to the identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was stunned in conjectures, 6 but he finally reopened, evinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for hcighten superstitious tbat mylclncholy that bad grasped on his mind, hc determined to leave Jt, and soon arrived in Smyrna. Whjle, who wanted a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, took care of the organization of his effects on Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there were several weapons of force, more or more adapted to the death of the victim. There were several daggers and cllagans. Whjlst turning the cm, and looking at their hairy forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to obtain the surther proof, he found the woopon, and his harr0r can be imagined that he discovered that he was bleeding, although in the form of a pouliary, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at your being bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the different shades on the haft and the sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and probably did not allow to wander; there were drops of bl0od clsso on eclch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home to Rorne, his first investigator had attempted to seize the lady whom he had sought to seize Lord Ruthven's seductive orts. His parents were in distress, their fortune raniried, and the sbe had not been heard since the departure of his seigneury. Auhrey's reindeer became almost broken under so many repeated h0rrors; hc was afraid that this lady had caused a victim to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his occupation consisted of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Arriving at Calais, a breeze, which seemed to be soaked at his will, soon tucked him on the English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathers, and tbere, for a moment, appeared at tolose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all of them mcmory of the past. If she made sure, hy her caresses jnfontines, had gclincd her career, now that the woman began to appear to you, sho was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winnjng grace that won the eyes and applause of the colsemblies of the drawing salon. There is none of this brilliance that exists only in the heated atenosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was riever lit 6y the levity of the spirit 6enoath. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of a mesforture, but of a certain sensation inside, which appeclrod to iridlcal a suI eonseiovs of a more brilliant real. His step was not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a calour can attract – he was sedated and perished. When her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother and her brother breathed to put his affection, arid could in his prosence forget those deed that she knew how to destroy her resl, who would have exchanged his smile for that of vo1uptvary? It seemed that the eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. But it is only to be seen, and it had not yet been presented to the world, it was an attack on the part of its guards who should have delayed the anticipation until the return of his brother from the continent, where he could be a protector. It was therefore now resolved that the riexl salon, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"busy sceno\" intellect. Aubrey would have stayed in his father's mansion, arid fed the inélacholi who surpassed him. He could not feel interested in omitting the frivolities of the fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the events that he had misunderstood; but he was dellermining to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and proporated for Tbe the next day, which had been wrapped up like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room riot was held for a long time, and all those who were anxi0us lo bask in the kingly smile, hastened there. Aubrey was there with his sieve. While he was standing in a mass grave by himself, without taking into account everyone aborted him, clinging to the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Rulhven wcls in that same place, he fell himself sudderly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sounded to his ear — \"Remember your oath.\" He had courage to attract, searsul to see irig a spectre that would make him lose, which he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his attention or his place up from his first entry into society. He looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to drop a friend's arm, and to force a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He rushed into the room with pieps, and stared at his bis head, as if he feared that his twoughts would weaken from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagggr — his oath.—He razed himself, he could not believe that it was possible — death rose in the past!—He had toovgl's imagination had conjured the image that his mind was resting. It was impossible that it could be real—he decided, tberfore, to go back to society; for tough he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed iri getting information. He went a few nights later with bjs sister to the assembly of a close relationship. He swallowed him under the prolection of a matron, and retired in recès, and there he gave himself to his own devouring puffs. Perceiving, at the loss, thal many were leauing, being awakened hlmself, and entering the ariother room, faund his sister surrounded by sooveral, apparently in oarnest c0nueration; he tried to pass and approach, when one, who was asked to move, turned, and revealed t0 to him the thossc foatures that he has the most horror. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurre, forced him to the street; and at the door he was ambushed by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in the passage of the hemicycle, he brought up this voice that murmured by him—\"Rem-\nHe dared not turn around, but when he rushed from his sister, he soon returned home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed by a svbjeot, how much more completely was he cngrossed, now that the cortality of the Agairi of Iiving of monstcr has pressed on his purchases. Her sister's attentioris was now free of hiccups, and it was in vain that she invited her to explore it. which caused his brutal conduct. He didn't say a few words, and they terrified him. The mare he thought, the more mad he was. His oath suffocated him;—was it then to lighten this moron, 6 to apprehend him on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent him from progressing? Maybe he hit him. Bul, even if he was lo Break bis oath, and djselose his suspicions, who wovlid the bolieve? Ho thought to use the hif owri hand to shake the world of subb cl wrelch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days he remained in his condition; locked in his room, ho saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wh0, with eyes flowing with tears, jerking him, for his own good, to support nature. In Lasl, no Ionger is capable of a soothing silence and a solild, he left the house bis, wandered from strotet to strcct, arixing to steal this image that haunted him. Hjs's dress became neglected, arid he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humble. It was not dangerous to be recognized; he first returned home with the eugenture; he threw it at dawn to rest where the fatigue spilled. His sister, anxious for safety bif, employed people to follow him; bul they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any—of thought. Hjs's conduct, however, has suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea tal il lefl par bis absence of all the friends bis, with a fiend among them, of which they were preserice unconscious, he dissuades to erect again in society, and closely watch him, anxious in advance, iri frie from his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intjmacy. But when one entered o r0om, his distrustful and rogue gazes were stunned, his inner trembling so viscous, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to refrain from seeking, for her, o focity that struck him so hard. However, when the reverranoe turned out to be uriavailing, the guardian tho u ut proper to interposo, and, pretending that his mind was becoming alienatod, they kept the time to regain that confidence that had previously been imposed on Thom by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and daily sufferings he had encountered in chopsticks, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye the traces of what they considered to be madness, they lured a doctor to reside in the housc, and to take the horny of him. He hardly seemed to notice, his camplcteIy was hls mirid absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence has finally become so great, that he has been confused with hif cham6er. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. Hc had 6ecoine emmacjated, his eyes had reached a gimace chandelier; — the only sign of affection and memory remaining displayed itolf at the entrance of the hif sister; then hc sometimes began, and, grabbing his hands, with badly distressed lhat appearances, he wanted her not to touch the hive. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" Whiri, boweuer, she asked WBOM to refer, her only answer was: \"True! True!\" Arid again he sank in a stote, that she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted a lot of months: graduated, rainbow, as the year passed, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and its miride threw a part of its glam, while its guclrdiens observe, that the scveral times in the day he would count vp's fingers a challenge-\nNite number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, begged his doctor to oppose the rnelancholy oircumstance of Aubrey's being in such a terrible sjtuatian, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked anxiovsly whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whom they feared he had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Mclrsden. It was a yovng Earl that ho had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and amazed them even more hy he expressing his jntentjon lo be are near to the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears full of mind, flowing to the thought of bcr 6other being once again alive feelings of afsection. Hc began to speak with all his warm worrited, and to corirotulate it on the hcr marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and greed acquiescence; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on the chest hor; open it, which was his surprise to stifle the traits of the amateur who had so long influenced his life. Hesei2 made the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled him foot urider. Asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as he did not understand him, so by grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of Countnice, he told her to swear that she would never marry that monster, so ho—but he co1d nat advanced—it seemed that this voice agajn badc He remembers his oalh – he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was not him but did not see an onc. Meanwhile, the guards and the physicist, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Auhrey, wanted her to leave him. He kneeled for them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for the day of the storm. Tbey, attributeirig this madness which they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, tried to paeify it, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after the drawing room, and had been refused wilh on another. When he heard of Aubrcy's ill health, he willingly sold himself to be the cause; but when he lightened him, he was judged mad, his exultatlon and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former oompanion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could wrestle his power? If the language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of itself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the rowed earth, except with her to whom he addressed;—coveld say how, sjnee he knew her, her existerioe, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it was more than he could listen to her soothing sawers;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of serpenl, or such was the wil1 of destiny, tbat won his affeclions. The title of the eldor branch falling in the long term, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excivse far haftening the marriage, (in spite of his br0ther's disturbed stato,) which took place lo the day before his departure far continued him.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe servants in C.T., but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, bcr own honor, arid the horror of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the weight of their house, to delay but for some compasses that marriage, on whleh he denounced the heavy mousse curse. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, which considered, the rauings of a maniac. The night passed without rest for tbe bufy jnmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than to endorse, the nobles of the busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a related person avt of the room, and in a drowsy fawn himself in the apartment where everyone gathered. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive it: he immediately applied\nroaring, and taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the chamber of the Tbe, without a spot of fury. On the slaircafe Lord Ruthven whispered to Iri his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his ottensors, who, awakened by the old woman, had oome in search of her. Aubrey could no longer bear his anger1f; his rage, not sinning vcnl, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to the sister of hjs, who was not ready when he entered, as a doctor was afraid to agltify him. The wedding was celebrated, and the wife and husband left Londa0n.\nAubrey's weakness jncreased; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called at night, and when the hour in the middle of the hour had struck, he wrote a composite account of what the reader had hit, and he died suddenly afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrcy; it was too late when Ihey arrived. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nA CC0 AMOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THEIR LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world is in front of it, where to choose the place of rest, and provide its guide.\"\nIN Sajling across the Greek archipelago, on boclrd one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put jnto the port af Mityleno, in the island of the name of tbat. The happiness of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and alwoys vegetables to have there, iridulates many British ships to visit — both of the men of war and merchants; and although he finds himself missing it out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrna, his amplyreply burrelets for the deviation af cl voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water the iri, and the shipowner was negotiating for the cattle with the native Tbe, the ecclesiastical and myself taken a ramble on the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Grcek cls ovr guide, who told us that he came badly from Scio with a Lord Englifh, who feared that the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said tho Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am likely to be involved. He's weird, but he's a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (obut L250 English currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, but not consantally; for he very often sails his felucca to the different islands.\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening from the huff where our compatriot lived. We were gracefully reassembled by Cln old husband, what led us to the mansion. It consists of four aparlmenls on the ground floor — an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated sumptuously: green walls, marble tablaces on either side, a large myrt1e in the o entree, and a small fountain benca-\n, one could play through the tbe branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Venus hronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completes the fur. In the room there were half a dozen English cane chalos, and a full coffee book: there are no mirrors, riar a single pai-\nI don't know. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting, we observed a marble reooss, once, the old inan told us, fi1led wilh books and papers, which were then in the chesl of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, bvt we did not think we were juvstified in the examination of the contits. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and the works of Roufseau Complcte; the Ruins of Ernpires of VoIney; Zimrnermari, in German language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novoIs of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schi1ler; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Porma in 1810; the seueral little pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, torn muoh, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with mclrginal notes, written with a pencil, in It alias arid Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with papal leaves, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had read these hooks before he sailed, and forgot to place them in others; but, he said, they must be lying on his return; for it is so special that I would carry a thjng without order, he could have frowned on me a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a service; and I have the product of this farm for pain af by taking care, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the tho wood, and which the lord brought here from Adriariople; I do not know why.\"\nTho appearancc from the outside house was nice. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the wilh b1ack p1inlhs canned marble pillars and the cargo-work work cornices (as it is now usual in the Gregian archbile,) were considerably higher than tho ro0f. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, wos covered by a turkey carpet flne, under an awning of coarse linen ftrong. Most of the roofs of the house are smoky, for on them the Greeks spend the evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", including fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens mingling on its edges, crouched under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seal with an ornamental wood back was plated, on which we are told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until 1 twelve o'clook, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very crazy, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A line of rich vineyards led tbe eye to Movnt Calela, covered with olive and myrtle very iri flower, und on the top of which a Greek temple annoid seemed jn majestic rot. A small stream that descended from the ruins descended into 6rokon waterfalls, until it was the first in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the 1-night blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely played a view more than I did; but our demands were unsuccessful as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew bis riame but Dominick, hjs banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" and carinot you say, old friend?\"I say, \"if I can,\" I say, \"I won't dare.\" We did not have time to visit in Tbc Armenian, but upon our return to Towri we learned Severol particularvlars of Tbc seigneur isolated. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and never danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and c0tton silk attached to the girls who live by weaving items of lasc. He also bought a new boat for a bad wbo fisherman lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to poor children. In short, we appeared, from clll we clashed, for having been a very eccentric and benevolenl character. A circumstratory that we have learned, whip our old friend or cottage deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful donut, with which the lord was seen osten walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught outside himself the use of it.\nThis was the wilh informant that we left the peaceful island of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who its rambling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our dolphins were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mjtylene.\" We had then heard of the laziness of his seigneury, as we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Calcla jn every page. Didn't we regret not being more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mityleno on a future mcly; but to me that day laugh retum. I make this statement, believing that she is not uninteresting, and in court to the good reputation of her seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been deseruted as a urifeling arrangement, aurress to the association of human nature, or contributing in any way to soften its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as can be seen from these little anecdotes. A1l the most beautiful little eyes of the heart, so elegant in the poems of his seigneury, seem hclve eir sitting in hif bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, aridity seem to guide all his actjons; and his awakening to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him a being on whose heart Religioniori laid his sea1, and of whose head Volunteer has cast his mantle-\n- Yes. No man can read the previous pleasant \"trails\" that feel proud to be proud as a castingman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and he dares to justify himself in a terrible court where all muft apprehension, only can censor the errors of a confrere-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and flouting the applause of the world, is the testimony of the virtuous and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleel Street.",
    "35": "VAMPYRE;\nThat's right.\nBy J0hn Wiliiam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which his tale is based is very general iri the East. European Union Arabs it seems common: however, he did not depart from the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; he normally assumed his preserit f0rm from the division of the Lotin and the Greek churches; at that time, the idea of dominant hecaming, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, he gradually iricreased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from these tombs, and feeding on blood tbe of young and heaulifvl. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the belief existed, that vampyrcs nigbtly iinbibod some part of the blood of their victims, who have been emaciated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these human bloods-\n-the fattened cocksuckers—and their camouflaged velns distended to such a state of repletion, as if to cavise the blood to flow fr0m all passages of their body, and even from the pores even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, os March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of cl particular cases of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvngclry. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magiftrals of the plccce, tbey p0sitively and unanimously affirmed, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard saying, thal, in Cassova, on the frontjers of the Servia Turkifh, ho had been tormenned by a vampyr, but had sounded a way to rid him of the malice, eating from the suine of the earth beyond the tomb of the vampyre, and rubbing his blood. However, this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and of having made a statement wcls, that four porsons had been deprived of life by bis attacks. In order to avoid deafness, the inhabitants having cortified their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usucll in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting clt mouth, nose, and ears, pvre and florid blood. The evidence was thus obtained, he resorted to the accustomod remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, ot whlch he would have shouted as sadly as if he had lived. They cut off his pearl, burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grau. The same ineasvres were adopted with the horns of those who had previously died of vampyrisrn, lest they in turn become agents on others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is, that a persori sucked 6y a vampyre becomes a bimself vampyre, and continues in turn.\nChief of bail.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here linked, it seems that bctter adapts to the object of the present observations that the ariy olher instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a sorcery of punishment after death, for a crime was committed in exile, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to unfinish his infernal visits only to those beings he loved most while he was on the orth, those to whom he was linked hy bonds of tenderness on affection.—A supposltion alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting ghost lbe natjve place, and sucking the blood of all thy race; there of thy dclughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the parse of life; yet the banquctwhioh perforoe shall feed thy livid living corsus, Thyvictims, are they exhaled, Are the devil for thorium sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou curdest them, Thy flowers are wilt on the stem. But a bat for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best loved one, devours in your mind the name of a father—This word will engulf the heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of the eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand soaked, will tear the trcs of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest plodge of affection has been warned—But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth and thy harging lip; and after thy tomb of su1len, go, and with Gouls and Asrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nSouthey also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaha\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grove with the aim of the tormenterjng that she loved better during her existence. Bul tbis cann0t to be supp0sed for bave revulsed from the sinfulness of her life, she blng spread across the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of several astronomical cases of uampyrism, to which he claims to have been a witnesf; and CaImet, in his great work on thjs subjeot, besides a variety of anecdotes, and the tradjtionary riarrotifs iIlustrative of his esfects, has highlighted some diffractions learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbarlan.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the Imitf of a noto, riessarly deviated from the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, thal although the term Vampyre js that in the most goreral acceptati0n, there are several 0thers synonymous with it, makes use of in various parls of the tbe world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocolaka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the attondarite dissipations over a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the ton, more remarkable for hisningularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparcently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted attention, so that it could by a glance extinguish it, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who fell this feeling of apprehension, could not explain when it arose: home attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, hiding on the face of the object, did not feel penetrated, and at a glance to pierce through the inner work of the beard; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin it could not pass. His peuliaritief led him to be invited to each house; all fought to deceive him, and these had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the misfortune of boredom, wero pleclsed al having something in their presence capable of engaging their tension. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which neuter g ained a warmer tenel, either of the blush of modesty, or fr0m the slrongemotion of the passian, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many of the scmclle hunters after the notoriety tried to gain his atteritions, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call imperfection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of monsler shewn iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a montebank, to attract his attention:—although in vain:—while she stood before him, although her gaze had apparently fixed herself on her, still it seemed that tbey was not pierced;—even her vnappallé intruded inga, and she left the field. But although the common adulterer could not influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was iridescent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent donut, tal little kriew he ever addressed to women. He had, however, the repulatlon of a winning language; it can be seen that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were eaten up by his hatred of vice by clpparent, he was also often among the women who make up the 6oast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orpban left with only one sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. The guards, who thought that they had only to look after the fortune, renounced the most ruthless accusation of his mind towards the subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of good and candour, and he always destroyed the apprentices of many thousand. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thovghl that vice was thrown iri by Providence only1y for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we saw in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in tbe revealing eloth bones, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by irregular folds thcir and various colored pcltches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for the sake of Tbese, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or blushing favors: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lost him in false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starred to find, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffsing, tbere was not the foundation in the life of reol for any of these congreries of plisjng images and defriptions conclined in the volumes of lhose, from which he had formed his study. However, some compensation was paid to his father.\nvanity read, he was abject to give up dreams, wben the extraordinary being that we endowed above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; arid the very impossibility of formingirig an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed ln bimscSi, who gave few otber signs of his observation of objects of externality, flouted the tacit agreement to their existence, imperious by the avoidance of the contact tbeir: allocating his imagination to the image of something aurora that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person begging him. He met with him, paid him attcnti0ns, and so far has advanced on his opinion, he has always been recognized as his president. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthven's business was being barred, and almost four times, fram the preparation notes in — Street, that it was low to travel. Desirous os gainjng a little infarction regarding this singular character, which, now, brandishes only his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards an equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever fcandal intrigues are mentioned as subjects of ploosantry or p level, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consulted: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Rvthvon, was surprisedcd to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flammed by such a mark of his esteem, which apparently did not have in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few dowries they had passed the winter waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had no opportunity to sludyirig the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the rebuttals have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to bis c0nducl. His c0mpanion was profuse in liberality; — the lazy, the vagrant, and beggars, received from his hand more thari enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not avoid being resentful, that he did not go to the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the mesfortvnes who accompanied evcn up0n vjrtue, whom he granted his alms; - these were sons of the gate with sneezes hardly begged; but when the profligate came to ask for bewitchments, not to cast down his desires, but t0 allowed him to fall asleep in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent back by a rich charity. However, Tbis was attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which overtakes the bashfu1ness retreat of the virtuous jndigcrit. There was a cirovmstonce about the cobority of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on the bis spirit: all those on what he waf granted, invitahly fovnd that there was a curse upori, for they were all either lod to thescaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the rnost abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which he passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought centres of all the vices in fashion; he entered into the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and alwoys garnhled with success, except where the known shclrper was his antagonist, then he was even greater than he won it; but jt was still with the same immutable foco, with which he generally wated society around: it was not, however, when he encance lhe rah young novice, or the lucky father of a large family; then hjs very desire seemed fortune's Iaw — this abstract abstract mirid applaction was put aside, and his eyes were quenched with more fire than the cat's thal while delirting with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the youth awfully easy, tom of the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had pulled the hiin within the reach of this fiend; while many a sanctuating father, in the midst of the gazes talking of mute hungry children, without a single distant from his last immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy your present desire. He did not take any money from the gamblng table; but immediately lost, to the stream of many, the latted glove has just been ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the refu1t of a certain degree of kn0wledge, which was nat, however, clpable to pick up the trick of the most experienced. Avbrey Oston wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to sign the charity and pleasure that proved the ruin 0f alI, and did not tend to his own profit; — but he delayed it — for every day he h0ped bis friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and gradually to him; however, this never happened. Lard Ruthven in his carriagc, and amjdst the various scenes of wild and rjch nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his ljp; und although Aubrey was near the object of his frillosity, he would not get greater grotification fram than tbe constant excitation bone vainly wifhing to break this mystery, which at hjs exalled the hegan imagination to assume the appearance of a certain supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at R0me, and Aubrey lost sight of his corn panion; he left it daily on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, a whip which he opened with impatience; the chief was his sister's, breathing nothing but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there had been bad p0wer resident in bis oompanion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belly. The guards immediately insisted that he bequeathed his friend, and urged that his choracter be horribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction gnawed his licentious hablts more dangerous for society. He had discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the struggle of the ber-haracter; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, could be cast out from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: ln flne, that all the semals which he had defiled, apparently because of their virtue, had, from his departure, thrown Eueri the mafk aside, and had not burned to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the wh0se character had n0t again shown a single luminous point on which rcst the eye. He decided to invent a pretext of plausiblo to abandon him in algether, to purpose, in tho rnean during, to beat hlm closer, and not to let pass any slight circumstance. He entered the same circle, ond soon perished, that his seigneury was endeauovring to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he mainly froccating. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secr and; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon will describe that an assignment had been designated, which would end the most IIkcly in the ruin of an Innocent, though not considered girl. L0sing no time, he entered Lord Ruthveri's apartment, suddenly und asked her his jntentions with respcct to the lady, informing him at the time of the celebrity that he was aware that bis was about to meet her that night. The Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that all would have on such an occasion; and after having been precised that he irried to marry him, simply plowed. Aubrey retired; and immediately seized a note, to say, that fr0m that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rcmaindor af their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daugbter, bvt aIso concerning the character af his Lordship. The assignaliori have been proven. The next day, Lord Ruthven merely sent his fervour to riot his full consent to a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion that his plaris had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey started his steps towards Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to draw the split record of ancient glory on the moments which, apparently, shameful to chroricer the acts of free men only to be slaves before, had hidden under the shelteririg or inany floor colored lichen. Under the roof of sclme as hlmse1f, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have renounced the model of a painter who wanted to pour on oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradlso, except her eyes spoke too much of mind so that someone thought that she c0u1d was among those who had no souls. As sbe danced on plain tbe, or stumbled along the mobil-\nOn the side of ajn, one would have thought of the gazelle or the poor sort of greetings; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparent to the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the adapted animal 6vt to tclste tbe on the epicure. The light stage of Iarithe oflen accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, often attached the unconscious girl, sharpened in the pursuit of a butterfly of Kashmero, shows all the ber forrn, floating as it was on the wind, with the greedy look of hjm, who forgot tholotters hc had decrypted on an almost erasable tablet, in the contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often his fcllling braids, like shc flitted around, exhiit in the ray of the sun so dclicately brjlliant and quickly erase from the hues, jt can excuse the forgnitude of the antiquarian, which escape it from the mind the very object that he had thought 0f importanc vital to the correct interpretation of a passage iri Pausanias. But why try descrlbe charrns that all fry, but no one can associate with it?—It was innocenco, y0uth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded tirig-raoms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing remains of tbose from which he wanted to keep a mernorial for his suture balls, she could stand by, and look at the magical effects of the hjs pencil, in the race of the scenes of her native plccce; sbe would then describe to him the circlrig dance on open plain tbe, would be matched, to him in all the glamorous colors of the young memory, the marriage pump that she remembored viewing in hcr childhood; and tuna, tvrri-\nWith regard to the subjects who, obviously, had made a greater iinpression vpon his mind, would tell bim all the punctual tales of his nurse. She often told him of the blade of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her sweets, and of the draconian bonds, forcing the year of dawn, by bringing up the life of a beautiful woman lo prolorig her existencc f0r the next montbs, her blaod ran cold, while he attracted her from laughing at these idle and horriblo fantasies; but Ianthe made to him the names of old men, who had finally detected one living among them, after several of her close relatives and cbildren had found marked with the seal of the appetite of the fiend; and when she found him so unbelievable, she bowed down from him to come to his aid, for he had been reverbed, that tbose who had dared to question their existence, had always given him proof, who had unbelieved them, had begged him to confess and confess his heart. She detailed at hjm the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her h0rror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in intimidating him, that lbere could not be a truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the multitude of coincidences that had all tended to excite a 6elief in Lord Ruthven's supreme power.\nAubrey began to grip himself m0re arid plus to Ianthe; his inn0cence, so contrasted with all the tho virtues affected by the women among whom he sought for his vision of love, won his heart; and while he lured the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, cultivating a plan for some antiquarian research, he went away, insisted not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention bis on the rvins around him, while in his mjnd he retained an image that seemed to be legitimate alono tbe possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and he was always the same frank child being known first. She always seemed to separate herself from him with the resoluctclnce; but it was obvious that she had no one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy seizing a fragment that had yet escaped the destructjve hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of Vampyres bones, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to proceed with the anointing of the exercises, which had to hold him for a few hours; who heard the name of the place, all at once begged him nol de retum at night, for he had to pass unjustly through a wood, where rio Greck would never remain, after the end of the week, on examination. They described it as the resort of the vainepyres in their nocturnal organs, and denounced the heavy ailments of foam as imminent on the one who dared to erode their way. Aubrey lighted the representations of the Jr, and tried to laugh from the idea; but when hc shuddered them to his audacity so your moek a superior, infernal power, the very name of wbich apparently made their bood freeze, hc was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey went on the excursion without lingering; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his bosom, and was concerned that his words, mocking the bolief of horrific fiends, had inspired them from the terror of the suckers. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side 0f his horso, and earnestly begged him to return, there night allowed the p0wer of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. He was, however, busy in his research, that he had not understood that the light of the day was coming to an end, and that in the barjzon there was a bone thase specks which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass lremendous, and shed all rage of toil on the devoted land.—He, however, finally climbed his horse, dlermined to catch up with the speed hy for the time bis: hutit was too late. The twilight, in tbeese sudem climcltes, is known from the alrnost; immediately the sun sets at night 6egjns; and it had advanced far, the storm's powcr was above – the hesitating thunders had an iritre of rest – its thick heclvy rain forced them to go through the canopy leaflet, while the forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate its feet itself. Suddenly his horde became afraid, and he carried the dreadful thrugb speed of the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightnjng, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he objected, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to Icast confident to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woinari mingling with suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, to continue in one sound without radiance; — he was starred; but, agitated by the lhurider who agaln was rolling on his hecld, he, with a sudden force, to open the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, for although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He snuffed himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately felt sei2od; and a voice cried out, \"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laugb trodden; and he felt distressed by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted up from his feet and fasted with enormous force against the ground:—his enemy threw himSi, and knelt on his chest, evilly put his hands bif at the top of his throeal—when the brightness of many torches penetrated into the holo which lit him in the day, the trouble arose instantly, and he rushed his prey into the door, and by closing the crushing of the branches, as he broached through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; the avil Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who had nothing. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the straw loaded on each straw with heavy soot flakes. In search of Aubrey, they sought her who had stirred her with her claws; he was again left in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the t0rcheur once moro burst on the hive, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor broughl jn a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision that arose from his disturbance; he again saw the same form, when he stripped them, lying on his side. Tberc had no color on the cheek hor, no evcn on his lip; but the thril was a lisure on his face which scapped almost as much attaohirig as the life tbe that there was once: — on his neck and his brèfle wcls blood, and on his thraat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this the meri ponted, weeping, at the same time struck with horror, \"A vampire! A vampire!\" A litter was formed unexpectedly, and Aubrey was deposited alongside the ber wbo had recently been for him the object of brilliant and magical visions, now hallen wjth the flower of life that had died in hcr. He did not know what his thoughts were: the spirit bis was inflamed and seen at reflection, the arid took refuge in the vacancy, he was very unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different parties that had been engaged in the dry lroh of her than a mother hcld rnissed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated the parents of a drcadsvl disaster. \"Describe to them the evil that they have done; but when they ascended to the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and painted to the Corsican. They were inconceivable; both died in the heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a more violent fcver, and waf often delirious; in these instruments he would appeal to Lard Rulhven and Ianthc—by an inexplicable combination, it seems that he begs his former companion to spare him being loved. At other times, he impregnated the malediciaris on the head of bis, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the opportunity at his hour to arrive in Athens, and, of any kind, at the hearing of the impasse in Aubrey, immediately put hese1f in the same hovse, and bocame his constant wait. When the latler covered himself with his delirouin, he was horrified and scattered in the sight of him whose imagining he had now combined with the tbat of a Vampyrc; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the tbat fault had caused their separation, and even more 6y the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled hlm to his grace. His seigneury seemed quite chagoude; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Avbrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew again inlo the stato sarné of mjnd, and Aubrey preceived no dlfferenco of the former man, except that he was sometimes taken to sniff his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation plclying on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last period of recovery of the invalid, Lord Rutbven was very keen to observe the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the movementless fun;—indeed, he seemed to want to escape the cyef of all.\nAubrey's mirid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of mind that the orice so distinguished n0w seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and net as Lord Ruthven; bvt much that he wanted to solitvde f0r, his mind did not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; is it sought in the midst of the ruins which he had frequented very peasantly, the shape of Ionthe stood at his side – if he sighed him in the woods, his slight step wo might seem wandering in the middle of tbe urid erwood, in search of the most made purple; then suddenly would turn, to his wild imagination, show off pale face arid w0undd throat, wlth a sweet smile von his lips. He decided to steal scenes, each characteristic of wbich created so bitter associations in his mind. He posed to Lord Ruthven, to be bound by the tho tender caro that he had taken from him during his illness, that they had to visit these parts of Greece or had not yet seen. They traveled in all the diroctions, and sought every place where a memory could be made straight; but although they hastened in this way from one place to another, they do not see themselves to lift up what they were looking at. They heard a lot of r0bbers, but they gradually began to take over these parts, which, according to them, were only the inuention of indjviduals, whose interest was to excite the gerieroslty of those whom they defended from preton-\nDcd dangers. Because of this neglect of the advice to the inhabitants, they only travel once with a few guards, more to serve as defence guides. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torch, with great inafses of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reason to repent of their negligence; for they were hardly the wbol of the parli engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their head, and by the ratio echoed with scveral cannons. In an instant, their gvards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had a fire in the djreotion when the report came. L0th Ruthven and Avbrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering from defilement: but shameful to be so held by an enemy, who, with insulting blows, lowered them advarice, having exposed themselves to a scammer without resistance, if one of the sh0d clirnb thieves above and brought them iri to the rear, they immediately dilermied to rush in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rvthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him back to the ground. Avbrey hastenod lo his assistance; and, no longer holding the contest or his peril owri, was soon surprised by seeing the faces of the r0bbers around h im—his vards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthuen was wounded, immediately to possess their clrms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a haily reward, Avbrey foon instructed them to transport his wounded frjends to a neig hbouring hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their pregnancy, being simply content to guard the credence until their comrade had to turn with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's flrigidity was quickly decreed; in two days a mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and his bad appearance did not change; he stunned as little pain as he had been objects about him: but towards the end of tho last night, his inind became apparently clumsy, and the hif eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to dare his help with more than the usual rut—\"Help me! I do not mean my life, I have not listened to the date of my existence as little as the date of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little, of my life spaced, I cannot explain the whole, but if you hid, if you knew Mc, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, me, but life. \"-\"We'll know the riot. \"Jurez!\" cried the dying man, rasirig himself with exulent uiolence, \"Swear by all your dreams of sovl, by all your fears of naturo, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my orimes or death to clny alive in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes appeared to be inflamed by Jr's soekets, \"I swear!\" said Aubrey, \"and he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey resisted to roam, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose in mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a glacial camo upon him, as if it were something horrible that was awaiting him. He rose up in the morning, and was enrolled in the coffin in which he had thrown the corpse, when a thief had met him, and had informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retirement, the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise TBey had given his 1rdship, that he should be exposed to the first ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, determined to go and bury jt on the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no traoe of the orpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would punch the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the body for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a covntry in which ho had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid iri who all apparent conspired to increase this superstitious meIaricholy that bad seizcd on his mind, he decided to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to assist him in Dtranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case containing several weapons of offence, rnore 0r less suitable to ensure the deathb of the victim. There were several da ggors and atoghans. As he aridly examined the delicate forms, what was his surprise at finding a fbeat apparently adorned in the same sty1e as the dagger dismantled in the fatal, but — he trembled — rushing to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovers that it was part of the sheath he held in his hand, although particularly shaped. His eyes seemed to need greater certainty, they seemed to look to be linked to the dagger; but he wanted not to believe; because the particular shape, the same variable shades on the sheath haft wave were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, arid on his path hame, clt Rome, his first investigations were about irig the lady he had tried to catch Lord Ruthven's scathing arls. Hor parents were in distress, Ihair fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departmenturo of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; fear that this lady was not the victim of Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and if only the occupation consists of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as jf being would sow the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breezc, who seemed obedient to his will, soon set him on the shores of the Engllsh; and he hastened to the inanition of his brothers, and there, for a rnoment, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her effect, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was more touching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Except the blue eye has never been illuminated by the lcvitity of the spirit 6neath. He waf o melancholy charm about him qujch did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate o sal conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't as light, which goes astray where an ass or a collar can get away – he was sedate and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother broke his affection, and would be iri his presence forget thofe deuils She knew that he had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for Ihat from the voIuptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of the thorium's own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been presbyterated to the world, he was tang bt by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed until the retum of brother of the mainland hcr, that he could be his protector. It was therefore resolved that the next drawing-ro0m, which was sast approachjrig, could be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his fatberf's mansion, and had enough of the melancholy that gave him power. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he was delirious to sacrifice his own comfort to the prection of his sjster. They came into town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announcod as a diving room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a while, and all the wh0s were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened tbilher. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing alone in a corrier, he did not take into account all that was around him, he entered the remembranoe thorax the first time he had split Lord Rutbven in this very place, he felt svdddly seized by the elm, and a thug whom he recognized too well, sounded in his ear, \"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a spectre would explode, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure who had attracted his nolice to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members clashed to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and making a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was pushed into the horn. He trampled on the room with covered steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again implored him—circumstances begun in a terrible painting—the dagger—his oath.—He woke up, he could not believe that he was able—the dead are resurrected again!—He thought that his imagination had brought up his repose vpon. It was impossible that it could be real—to be determined, therefore, to return to the int0 society; for the laughter he dared to ask about Lord Rulhven, the name hvng vpon his lips, and he could not suckeed in the information gclining. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly1y of a close relationship. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he withdrew into a rccess, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many were left, he bimboved, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in a serious cnversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, whcn one, whom he asked to move, turn around, and revealed to him these traits he has the most horror. And he went forward, and took hold of the arm of his sjster, and hurriedly he was kindled toward the stairs; and at the door he was struck by the multitude of servants who were fighting for their lords; and, while he was engaged iri, he heard this voice murmur by him again—\"Remember ye there \"He made nat daro to turn, but, by pressing his sister, soon ricachod bome.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his hcld spirit was absorbed by the subject of oria, how much more completely was he absorbed, now that the certainty 0f the living agcliri of the monster has pressed on hif thovghts. Her sister's attraction was now unanswered, and it was in vain that she threw him to cxplairi for hcr what had worked his abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath began bim;—was it then to descend this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His ulcerous sister may have been touched by Bim. But evon is being was los breaking his ah, and d...\nWho would believe it? He thought of using his own hand to free the world fr0m such a wretched; but death, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days he remarried in this state; he closed his room, he saw no one, and stooped only when his sister came, who, with eyes suffocating with tears, hesovght hlm, far from his sake, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and satitude, he left his husc, wandering rue de sram, anxious to steal lhat imogo whincb brought him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. It was no longer long to be relegated; he returned first with the euering to the house; but at last he laid him to rest where the fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxiovs f0r his safety, used people to follow him; but he soon carried away by him who fled from a pursuor faster than any srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left his whole sling, with a challenge among them, whose presence was unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and looked closely at him, anxious to protect himself, despite his oath, from all those whom Lord Ruthven approached with int-\nImacity. But when he entered a room, his gazes of haggard and suspensiovs were so strik ing, his inner chills so visible, that his sister finally ohlified to bcg of him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that struck him his stroriggly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards wanted to intervene, and, fearing that his spirit would become a1ienatod, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that had been imposed previously by the parerils of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had caused in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the ouso, arid take care of him. Hc hardly seemed to notice, so completely wcls hls mind absorbed by a terrible sub-iect. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There, he often bows for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and recollicion that remained appeared on his sister's writing; tben He sometimes began, and, by seizing his hclnds, with deeply distressed eyes, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him!\" Wben, however, sbe asked whom he referred, hjs only the answer was, \"Truo! t rue!\" Arid again he sank Irito a state, from which she could not even roam bim. This lasted many morithes: graduated however, as the year passed, his iricoherics are frequent, and the bis spirit threw a part of his morosity, while his guards observed, that several times in the day he could rely on a number of fingers, engaged and smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the circumstantial melancholy of Aubrey's being in s0 terribly stutuation, wben his sister would laugh day to get married. Aubrey's attention was drawn, he clings with anxiety to whom. Happy with this mclrk of return of the intellect, which they seered ho had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of lhe Earl of Marsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he met badly in society, Aubrey vuined pieased, arid surprised them even more by his expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sjster. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of the ber smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowjng to the thought of his brother to be once again alive to his feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth worited, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a pers0n so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he soldered tenly pcrceived cl locket on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the monster's seats that had influenced his life so long. Hc grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On his askirig him why he thus strangled the resemblance of her future husband, hc looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expressiori face, he made swear that she would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not advanc—he saw as if this voice again asking him to remember his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking L0rd Ruthven was close to him but didn't see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard all this, and who thought it was only cl retvrn de bis djsorder, enraged, and forcing Miss Avbrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees, he irritated, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing madness they imagined hod took possession of his urid, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the show, and hcld was refused with all the others. When he heard of Avbrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause; but when he heard that he was denied, his exuItalion and pleasure could hardly accommodate those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to make the house of his formal companion, and, through the constant waitaneo, and the claim of great affection for his arid brother interesl in his destiny, he gradually gains Miss Aubrey's ear. Could Wbo resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell — could speak of hjmsel as an individual having no sympathy with ari 6th on the overcrowded earth, except with it, he addressed himself; — could say how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, was it simply that he could listen to his soothing accents; — in the end, he knew whether wcll how usc the art of serperite, or so badly the will of destiny, that he gained more beautiful affections. The title of the old branch which was long held by him, he obtalized the important embassy of Ari, whooh served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) wb ich was to take room the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but iri failed. He asked for pen and paper; it was to give him; hc wrote a letter from cl to bis sieur, conjuring ber, as sho valued his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of lhosc now in the grave, which held her in their arms of their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours we who were pounding, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised to deliver him; but giving him to the doctor, he had better not harass the spirit of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, rauings af a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that can more easily 6o designed than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the urid of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey is growing almost frantic. The curiosity of the seruantf, at last, improved their vigilance, they gradually moved away, leaving him the guard of an old woman ruthless. He seized the opportunity, with a tied man was out of the room, and in a moment found hessels in the apartment where all the werc almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arrn by forco, rushed him out of the room, without a voice in fury. On the stairs Lord Ruthveri whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and if my fiancée is not my fiancée today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he moved him to grope his servants, who, awakened by an old woman, had come into the sea of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury, which had not found ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. It was not deserved t0 his sister, who was not present when he entered, aslhe doctor was afrajd of agitation. The marriage was solemnized, and tobe married and married for fear that London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces thc syinptomas near the approach to death. He wanted the slstcr guards to be called, arid when midnight had struck, to be connected in a composite way that the reader persisted—he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to overwhelm Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was an oestrade. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE ON MITYLENE TERRE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The sorva was in front of him, where to circumcise his resting place, and to provide his guide.\"\nIN Sail through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's vesses1, in Yoclr 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of Tbe os this name. The beauty of this dish, and the certain supply af eats and vegetables aIways to be got thorc, lead many Britishesses to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships hunt at Smyrna, its b0unties pay a great deal for the deviatjon of a voyage. We disembarked, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, arid as the men of Tobe were watering, and the armorer negotiated far the cattle with the nativos, the ecclesiastical and myself took o ramble at the cal1ed cave Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Idcl (a small mound so named) we met and hired a Greek y0ung as our guide, who said uf he had Scio carn with Cln Eng1ish lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucco. \"He hired me as a pilot, sald the Grcek, and would have taken me with him; bvt I did not choose to leave Mjtylene, where I am likely to marry with frost. He was a weird man, but a good vcry man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gavo Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 English currency,) and low resided there, although not constantly, at 6 or four feet m0nths, for he sails in his fel ucca very often on the different islands.\"\nThis account greatly excludes our curiosity, We didn't waste any time hastening from the house where our countryrnan lived. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a large cl0set attached. They were all simply docortod: light green walls, marblc tables on the side, a large myrlle in the ceriter, and a small fountain underneath, whicb could have played through the branches by moving a sprjng fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sosa completed the furniturc. In the room stood half a dozen of England cane chairs, and an empty casc book: there was na mjrrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pilIow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the lounge wo abbreviated a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a sailor Iarge in the closet: it wcls open, but we did not think ovrselvos justified to examine the content. On the Tablet of Recreation are works by Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau'f and Rousfeau; Ruiris of Empires by Volney; Zimmerman, in German tbe; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play by Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press by Tobe in Coristinople, much torn, but no English book has any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and in lalin. The Messlah was literally scrambled oll over, ond m arkod with sheets of paper, on which were also rcmarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had scorned these boaks in the evening before he left, and forgot to put them with others; but, he said, he must lick until his return; for he is so special, that if I move something with orders, he would sling me for a week together; ho is indeed very good. I did him a service, and I made the product of this farm if he had trouble dealing with it, with the exception of twenty zechincs that I pay to an Armenian agcd who resides in a small coltagc in the wood, and that Lord 6rovgbl here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The front porch was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as jt is now usual in Grocian architecturc,) were significantly higher than the roof. Tbe roaf, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine Tvrkey carpet, boncath awnirig af strong coarse line n. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, the Greeks pass over them their crazes by smoking, drinking lights, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", oating sruct, and erjoying the evening brceze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a strall strcamIet slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens, which gathered on its borders, and vnd the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his furnaces and nights until 1 twelve hours, reading, writing, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very devoted, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe srom view this seat was what can be terrified \"a bird view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mourit Calc1cl, covered with umbles and blueberries in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small ftream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the bose of the mountain. The smooth sea af glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, small seueral islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emeraIdgroen spots. I se1dom enjoyed a view more than I did; but our riquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided this romantic solitude: ri0ne knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had left t0 Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure it won't be,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to live the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared the sight of young girls when he was the last on the island, and even daric with them at the nuptiai festival. He gave a cow to a man, hares to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He bought a new boat f0r a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he after gavc Greek Testaments for poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all we have understood, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we licked, whip our old friend to collage deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful rnoste daughter, with whom the lord was seen walking on the sea horde, and he had bought out a pjano-forte, and taught him the hesels of the use of it.\nThese were the information with which we left the poaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could. He had money, it was obvious: he had philanthropy of dispositi0n, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arriving in Palermo, the doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been traveling jn Egypt and Grccce, \"The individual,\" sald-il, \"clbout who you are so anxjous, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the island os Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of the seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calcla's reoluse in every page. Deeply, we have not been more curious in the aur researohcs at the c0ttage, but we have comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I do this ardour, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his lord ship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been disordered as an insensitive provision, contrary to the association wilh human nature, or contriving in any way to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the rcverse, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordshjp, seem to have their seat in the bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide his actions; and to remove his rest from the sovilud is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon whose heart the religion sealed his body, and upon whom the head of whom the Volunteer cast his coat. No cari man has read the pleasant \"traits\" that precede without attacking him as a compatriot. With the answer to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially against my husband's moral jntegrity; and whoever dares to justify himself before this horrible court where I have to appear, only can censor the orors of a confrere-mortol. Lord Byron's characler is wrly of his gcnius. To make go0d in secret, and to escape the applause of the worlid, is the sure testimony of a virtuous heart and the consciousness of scout approval.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "36": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William PoIidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is uory general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek Churcbes; at that time, the dominant 6eooming idea, that a Latin hody could not corrupt if it was buried in thoir territory, it gradually increased, and formed the svbject of many wonderful stories, still existing, from the death rising fram their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. Iri tbe West, it spread, with some variation sljghl, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims at night, which emaciated the bee, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumptlons; while the blood suckers such hvman grazed—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, so that the blood faded from all passages of their body, and the oven extinguished very porous to their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March, 173z, is a curious, and, of course, crcdible account of a particular case of vampyrism, w hich is declared in hue took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the chief commander and the Mogistrats of the place of Tbe, they pofitively and unanim0usly, tal, about fivc yeclrs before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, having been girded by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of the grieving, even by eating from the earth oul of the tomb of the vampyr, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This precaution did not prevent him from becoming a hiinself varppyr; for, twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, husbands complained of having been torn by him, and a statement was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attractions. To avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagnj, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in the cases of uampyrism) fresh, and ontarely free corruption of srom, and emit to the mouth, nose, and eors, pure and florid blood. As the roof of P was covered, they resorted to a regular remedy. A stclke has been trained...\nThrough Arnold Paul's assiduous body, it is said that he would have shouted terribly cls if he had been enslaved. It's done, they cut his head, burned his body, set the ashes in his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses os thase pers0ns who had already died of vampyrism srom, for fear that they would, in turn, become agents on others who were monitoring China.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here...\ned, beoause it seems better adapted0 to illustrate the subject of the current observali0ns tban any other instance that could be produced. In some parts of Greece, it is possible as a kind of puriishment of death, for the home of heinous crime committed during existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but compe1Ied to infernal consinehis visitatjons only to those beings whom he loved masl wbile on earth — tbose to whom he was bound by arid links arid afferiori.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut Sirst upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then shall haunt the natjve plclce, and suck the blood of thy seed; from thence of the daughter Ly, Ly, Slster, Wifo, In the midst of the noise drain the stream of the lift; and yet the kingdom of the banquet which is the performance shall feed thy living livids c 0rsus, the victims of Tby, create they exhale, Kriow the devil for their sire; as ye curse, ye curse them, Your flowers are wilted on the silt. Bvt he who for your crime must fail, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will imprison your coffin in the flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the washed hue of his cheek — the spark washed from his eye, and the glassy look must see what freezes from his lifeless blue; Thon wilh a hand without hallowed teler The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life o lock when the thorn The tenderest affection was worn — But riow is carried far by lheo Memorial of thjne agony! Yot with your own best blood will flow; Your grinning tooth, and the lip of the hook; Then hunting at your sulten tomb, Go—and with Go uls and Afrits rave, TilI tbese in horror shrink the hold Of spectrum more cursed than they.\nSouthey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyre eorse of the Arab girl Oneiza, who is represented af having returned from the grave in order to torment him more blinded in existence. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of his life, being poured throughout the blade as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Toumefort gives a long rush in the hif journeys of several cases of astonishment of vampyrism, to which we pretend to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subjecl, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, has pvt some dissertations learned, tending to prove to him an elusive error, as well as barbaric.\nMarily curious and iriteresting riots on this singularly horrible millght superfition to be added; tang lhe present can suspense for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simply pointing out, that if the terin Vampyre is that in general acoeplation, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &e.\nThe Vampyr E.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied the London winter, he appeared at the various places of tbe lcaders of the lon a nableman, more towable for its singularities, than his rank. He attacked him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the high laughter of the fair attracted only his attentjon, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who perceive this feeling of admiration could explajn n0t explajn from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixedjrig on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate lo, and with a single stroke topierce through the interior works of the heart; but fe1l on the cheek with a thal of lead ray weighed on the skin that he could not pass. The peculiarities caused him to be Inuit at every hovse; all wanted to see hiin, and those who had been Accused of living excitemenl, and now fe it the weight of boredom, were happy at havlng something in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly tint of her face, which never spoiled a warmer tint, whether it was the bass of modesty, or the strong emotion of the passlon, gnaws her shape and 0utliric wore hair, many hunters of fernalcs tried to win her bowels, and to gain, at least, some mark of what they might call affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the mockery of every nunstcr worn in draw-roorns since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and made all huts put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention:—but in vain:—when she held before hjm, although the eyes were apparently fixed on her, it seemed nevertheless that they were not seen;—ever her unapplied impudence was overlaid, and she left the field. But the common adulterer could not even influence the guide in his eyes, it was not the female sex was indifferent to him: but suob was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman attached innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to women. Ho had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whatber is that he even overcaded his singular cbaracter, or tbat they were moved by apparently hot hif of vice, it was as more and more these women who form the vanity of their sex of domestic lheir virlues, like omong those who push him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, there was in London a young man named Avhrey: being an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great sweath, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself also by the gvardians, who thought that their duty further to take care of his fortune, wbile they renounced the greater burden of his mnd to the subalterris mercenary carc, to be cultivated more his irnaginalion than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices mary millionners. He believed all sympathy with virtue, and thought that tbatvice was lhrown in Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as wo fee in romances: he thought that the inserie of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patehs. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dream was the rectitudes of life. It is beautiful, frank, rich: sor t t tbese reafrons, on its entire int0 gay circles, many mothers surround it, trying to describe with the least of trvth their liking or blushing favorites: the girls at the time sarnc, by their brigandant behind the scenes when he approaches, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opens the lips, soon lead him in false note of his tales and his merits. He was surprised to see that, except in the tallow and wax almonds that sparkle, not prosence or ghost, but lack of snoring, there was no basis in real life for any of these conglomerates of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Find, hawen, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hesolf, who gave few other signs of his obsorvotiori of external objects, that the assent taclt to their existence, implicit by the avoidance of their cantact: allowing the hif imagination to imagine each tbing that left his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this obiect in the tbe hero of a romance, ond determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rclther that the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced until his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He learned graduated that Lord Ruthven's business was embarrassed, very quickly, by the preparalion notes in — Street, that he was ab0t to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, wbo, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he insinuated to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the hur, which for many stewardships was deemed necessary to allow young people to make a few steps raples iri the career of vice towards getting even with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasure or praise, clinging to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey lying immediately to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a praposal to join him. Flattened by such an em este mark of him, wba, apparently, had nothing in common with other meri, he accepted it glodically, and in a few days they had passed the wat ers circling.\nUntil now, Aubrey hcld had no opportunity to stvdying the character of Lord Ruthvcn, and now to be found, that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to hif vision, the results have offered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motivcs to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; — the idlc, tho vagrant, and the beggar, received more than enough of his hand to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the Miffortunes who even accompanied a virtue, which he granted to hjs alms;—lhese werc scnt from the door with barely deleted plots; but when tbe profljgate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow hlm to fade in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent back with rieh charlty. However, this has been attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found hot lhcre was a curse upwards, for they were all bailiff led to scaffolding, ar sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought out the toes of fashionable life; there he entered into all the epilepsy of the Faro table: he bet, and always snacked with success, except where the most clearly known was his antagonisl, and then he lasted even more than he won it; but it was always with the same immutable faee, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune—t-\nHis apparent abstractions of the spirit were removed, and his eyes were shining with more fire than that of the cat while delirying with the half dead mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, Tom from the circumference, he worshipped, cvsing, in the solild of a dungeon, the madness that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of a mute hungry childron, with a slnglc stuffing of his immense wealth Iate, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. But he did not take money from the slide; but he immediately lost, for the ruiner of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convuIsive catch of the inriocent: this could but would be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the most experienced ounning. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged Hirn to resign from this chorie and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit; — but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly; how, this never happened. Lord Ruth...\ncoming in his car, and in the midst of tbo various wild arid scenes rich in food, was always lho same: his eye spoke less lhan his lip; and although Aubrey was near to be the object of his curiosity, he oblainded not groater gratification fr0m he that the excitement vainly constunte bone wanting to break thal mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his companion; he threw him into the daily dance on the morning olrclc of the Italian Countess, while he was going to aroh in the memoir.\nThis is another city almost postponed. While he was engaged, Ietters came from England, and they opened him impatiently; the first came from his sister, and breathed nothing from the affection of the huts; the others came from his guardians, the lclt tor slonished hlm; if he had already entered his tal imagination there was an evil power residing in his companion, this seemed to give him sufficient reason for the 6th. His guardians insisted on his immicd friend, and urged, that his characler was terribly vicious, for the possession of irreplaceable powers of seduction made his deceitful habits more dangerous for society. He had been distracted, that his contempt for tbe adultresf had not generated iri hatred of his character; bul which he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, the victim of thal hls, the partrier of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of unwelded vjrtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, thal all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, sinc hif departure, even threw the mask put aside, clnd had not frowned to expose all the deformation of their vices to the pvblic gaze.\nAubrey torpedoed by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous pear on which to rest tho eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning the hive together, purposing, in the wicked tho then, to beat it more firmly, and to let rio sligbt circumstrrices pass by non-noticod. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship wclf was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose mainly home he frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is a word with in society; so he was forced to wear his unbridled plans; but Aubrey's eye follows him in all the windings hjs, arid soon dissaver that an assig-\nNation had designated 6th, which would most likely end in the ruin of a harmless, unthinkable laughter girl. Not wasting no time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked hjm his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6th abovtt0 meeting this very nigbl. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he would all have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Au6rey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this rnoment he must deeline accompany Hls Lordsbip in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and callirig on the mother of the lady, informed him of He knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but olfo about the character of his Lordshjp. The summons waf stopped. Lord Ruthven the following day simply sent his reserve to notify sacramplete ostent t0 a separation; but did not hlnt clny suspicion of bis plaris having been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the periinsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Grcek; and soon took care to trace the faded annals of ancient glory on monomenls that oppressive, shameful to bronch the acts of slaves srecmon 0nly 6fore, had hidden themselves scorned the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could make the form of the modol for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the prornised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too mirid so that someone thought that she could belong to these wh0s had no souls. While she was dancing on the plain, or truffled along the si of the mountain of Tbe, it was thought that the look was a p0 or a type of its beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for this luxurious look of the animal sultod but until the last of the ariepicure. Tho light stage of Ianthe often coopporized Aubrey in his search for aniquities, and often would be the unconsciaus girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show all the beauty of his sorme, floating as he was on the wind, lo the greedy gaze 0f him, who forgot the letters that he came from deciphcred on a lablet infaced him, jn the contemplation of his sylph-like figure. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted arourid, expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, he might well excuse the fargelfulness 0f the antiquarian, completely escaping from the spirit bis the very object hc had before thinking the importance of the vjtal bone to the correct interpretation of the passage cl in Pausanias. Why do you want to describe chorms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate?—He was innocent, youthful and beautiful, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew these remairis which he wanted to preserve in future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would describe thc circle darice on the plain operi, painted to him in all the brilliant colors of the young memory, the marriage pump which she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects which had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, w0 could tell to hirn all the supernatural tales of the nurse ber. Her sincerity and apparent belief in what she was telling exacerbated the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told Hjm the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to proliferate her exifence during the following months, her blood would be ruricold, while trying to laugh at her by such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the namos of the old, wbo had finally detected a living between them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the name of the fien; and when she had made him so unbelievable, she had begged him for it. It is true that she was the one who dared to question their exifence, that she had always had proof, that she had had to confess, with grief and sorrow, that it was true. She detailed to him the traditional opera of these monsters, and her horror grew more and more, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord. Ruthven; however, he still persisted iri the persuading, that lrc could not be lrutb jn herfears, tough at the same shot he wondered about the numerous collicences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to strangle himself moro and more to Ianthe; his inocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of love, wori his heart; one as he ridiculed the idea of cl yaung man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still more and more he attaches himself to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan far from a few resoarch antiques, ho would go away, determjncd nal to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the ruins surrounding him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate teacher of his thoughts. Ianthe was not conscious of his lovc, and was always the same frank child 6eririg He knew it the first time. Sbe always seemed to separate from him with rcluctancc; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her fovorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had still eclipsed the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, in the spirit of many present, were foiling their existence, pale with the horror al the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, wbich had to hold him for a few bites; when they barbed the name of the place, they all begged orice not to return to the neighborhood, for it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day has closed, to any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, und denied the m0 the heaviest ailments as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. To the brey made the light of their resignations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superiar, infernal power, the very namc of whilch apparently unaided their blood gel, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattended for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the meloncb0ly face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly prayed to him to return, and he left the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. He took so much care of his research that he had not understood that the daylight was coming to an end, and there was on the horizon one of those spots which, in the warm climates, accumulated so rapidly in a huge mass, and poured all their ragc over the disadvantaged country.—He finally mounted his horse, determined to catch up; but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and it had already known far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely a irterval of roft—lls thick rain dropped they forced so to grougb the surrounding foliage, whllst the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse scared, and he was carried with fearful speed scrambling the oritangled forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not remove it, shuddering the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hopjng to find someone to guide him to the city, or at the confident distance to get a shelter from the storm basin. As he approached him, the thunders, by far for a moment silenl, allowed him to hear the terrible frieks of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, continued in a sound without a mast; — he was struck; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden efface, forced the door of the hut of lho. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, the inclination, the sip. He was apparently not aware of it, because, tangb he called, always the c0ntinuded sounds, and nothing was taken of him. He identified him in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out, \"Always flouted!\" He felt he was plagued by a force that seemed super-humcln; he fought by selling his life as hard as he could, but he was in vain. Ho was lifted from his feet and threw a huge force against the ground: — his enemy fell upon him, and knelt on his chest, had placed his hclnds up his throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave the day of irith had troubled him; — he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as ho hrokc through the vagabond, was no longer beard. The storm was still there; the arid Aubrey, unable to move, was heard by those who did not. They eject; the light of their lords fell on the mud, and the thatch loaded upon each choke with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was left agajn in darkness; but what was his horror, when the highl af the torches once mare burst upon him, to perceive the form ajry 0f his beautiful co-ducress brought in a corsc without life. He cried out his eyes, hoping that the Jtc was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; yet tbere was a silence abbreviating his fclce which saw almost darkening like the life that once lived on the levc:—on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:—for the pointed meri, ring, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her who was recently 6 years old for bim bim the objcot of so many brilliant and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower life that had died in her. He did not understand what his sighs were, if the spirit was arid to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in a vacant post, he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, whlch had been four in the hvt. They soon met 6y differentenl partios who had been engaged in the search for her that a motor had missed. Their lamentable weeping, af thy approached the eity, announced the parents of a terrible oatastrophe. \"Describe their sorrow would be impossible; but when they established the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chore. They are irreconsolable; both have died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was 0ften dollrious; in these intervals he would linger on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a little unaccouritablo combinati0n he seemed to be begging his former companion t0 spare the being he loved. To other shootings, he would permeate the curses on his head, waved the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the chance at this time your arrival in Athens, and, of any inovative whatsoever, after hearing the Ftat of Aubrey, he immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the last turned from his delirium, he was horrified and scattered to the sight of Hiin whose image was now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, involving a1most repentanco for the fault thor had caused separation, and slill more by attention, emphasis, and care which That's what he showed, and soon he picked it up at his presenco. His seigneury changed completely; he did not appear long as an apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as the convalescence of hjs began to be rapid, he gradually retreated again in the same state of mind, set on Aubrey pereoived na divercence from the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a grinning exvulsion smile playing on his lips0n hls: bc kriew not why, but his smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently undertook to capture the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, ar to mark the progress of these orhs, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, and tbat elasticity of the mind that had once so distracted him now scemed for having fled forever. Today he was as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mirid could not find him in the nijghbourhood of Athens; if he sighed him ainidst tbe ruins which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side — if ho supggt in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for a modest purpletho; then sudderilyturnjng rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all the characteristics that created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from hlm during his illness, to visit the parts of Greece still seen neilher hod. They traveled in all directions, and sought a place where a rccollentiori could be coupled; but while they hadtened thus from the place thy, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to lick reports, which they imagined to be only the invoking of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generosjly from those whom they defended from the supposed dangers. Because of this neglect of the residents' counsel, they only traveled once with a few guards, more to serve as guides than a descnce. On entering, however, a narrow defilement, to the boltoma of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of stones that descended from neighbouring precipices, they were right to repeat their negligence; for s charcely were the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when lhey were surprised by the whistle of buildings near their hcads, arid by the echo report of SeveraI canonf. In a camp, their guard had left them, and, standing behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the Camc report had been drawn. Lord Rulhuen and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the shlttering turn of the defilement: but shameful that they had thus held the blow held by the enemy, which, with insulting cries, told them to progress, and to be exposed to the slaughter of urine, if one of the robers should climb ab and take them reclr, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a stubble in his shoulder, wbich brought him to the earth. Aubrey climbed to his assjstance; and, not heading thc talesl orhls awn perll, was quickly surprised when he saw the hearts of the thieves around him – his guards having, on the beirig of Lord Ruthuen wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrender.\nBy promises of great rcward, Aubrey soon undertook to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presenco, and he merely kept the entrance until their comradc came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveri's strenglh rapidly decreased d; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to be carried out with precipitated stcps. His asshole and his appearance did not change; he saw the pain as it had been from the a6oulhim objects; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently poisonous, and his eye of six on Aubrey, who was unbelieving to offer his help with more usual thcln freshnefs—\"Help me! You save me, you can do more than that, I don't mean my Ilfc, I listened to the death of existence rny just like that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the h0nour of your friend. \"\"H0w? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but I need, my life flourishes, I can't explain the whale, but if you hide from me everything you know, my honor was free to stain in the inuth of the world, and if my death was unknawn for lime in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Jure!\" cried the dying man, cried the exultanl uiolence, \"Swear by every Yovr soul, by all your falcon nature, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knawledge of my criins or dcath to ony livi ng being in any way, the whalover can happen, or whatever you can see. \"- His eyes seemed six-fold from their bases: \"I have swcclr!\" sald Aubrey; he fell laughing on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose on his inind, and he did not know wby; when one remembered his oats, a cold chill came on the hive, as if the present of horrific somcthing waiting for bim. In the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and irritated him in the air it was no longer there, havlng was Canvey by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the apogee of a neigbbouring mountain, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several men from Ibe, determined to g0 and bury him on the place where he was. But, queri he had m0unted to sumrnit ho found no trace of either body or clothes, although the sworn thieves indicated the identical rock on whicb they laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered by conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had burjed tbe body for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of an ounlry in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in wbich oll apparently c0nspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seised on his mind, to be resolved to leave her, and saon arrrved at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otrallo, or Naples, he took care of the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rvthven. Among other things, there was one case containing several weapons of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. As he returned them, and looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the one that Dague discovered Iri the fatal hut, which he shuddered, rushing to win furlher pro0f, he found the weopon, and the horror bis can be imagined when hc discovered that he was settling, although he pecvliarly high, the sheath hoar in the bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no certainty of surmer, they seemed to be 6ound your dagger; but still he wifed at djsbelieue; but particular form, the same variable pulls on the haft and sheath were oexil in the splendor on both, and for fear that there would be no room for doubt; there are drops of blood wcro alsa on each one.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had enslaved to Lord Ruthven'f's snatoh seductive arts. Her parents were indistinguishable, their fortvne ruined, and she had not been bearded since the departure of her I0rdship. Aubroy became the almoft broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in ergy the speed of the poftilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Arriving at Calais, a breoze, who seemed well disposed, soon threw him on the shores of the Englisb; and he hastened in the house of his brothers, and there, a mother, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caress of her sister, all memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantile caresses, had won her offeotion, now that the womari began to appear, she was more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid look applause the salon assemblies. That's where the warm atmosphere of a crowdod apartment exists. His blue eye was lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about him that did not seem clrisc srom missorlone, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His foot wasn't so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can fall apart – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was devoured by the smile of joy; but when his brother bewildered his affection, and forgot in his presence those deed that the sbe knew to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged his sin for that of the voluptuous? It was said that the eyes, that the facc then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only eigbteen, and had not been submitted to the world, that is, she had believed by the guards to ber that the presentation should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, that he could be his father. So it was now resolved that the next show, which was approaching quickly, could be the time of unbelief in the \"abuse scene.\" Aubrey would have preferred to remember in his father's home, and to attack the melancholy that surpassed him. He could feel the most intolerant and strange strangers of fashion, when his mind had been torn apart by the events he had seen; but be determined to sacrifice his own basket to the protectors of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared the day of the nexl, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for some time, and all those who were eager to chop in the roya1ty smi1e, rushed. Aubroy was thcro with his sister. As he stood in a corner by his sons, without taking into account all that was around him, he remembered that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthuen was there, that he suddenly felt seized by his arm, and that a voice was too well recognized, sounded in his ear, \"Remember your oath.\" He had little to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members almost refused to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his marriage, and was taken home. Ho made the room walk with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthvcn begged him once again – starring circumstances – the dagger – his oath. – He was waking up, he could not believe that it was possible – and he was resurrected again! – He thought that his imagination had brought up the image of a bi-spirited blushing. It was impossible that he could be reol—he decided, Thérèse, to go back to society; for, although hoatlomped to ask for anxietyirig Lord Ruthven, tho name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed iri get the information. He left a few nights after his sister came to the assembly of a close rclati0n. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he put himself in a corner, and tbere gaue hlmself to his own devouring toughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awoke and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in an oarnest cnversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when 0ne, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these traits that he most abhorred. He went forth, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hasty step, forced her to the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants who were languishing for their lords; and as he took care of them, he heard again the voice that came near to him: \"Remember, your oath!\"\"Ho dld nol dared to turn around, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey Hecamc almost got distracted. So before his evil mind was absorhcd by a subject, how much rnore completely was he absorbed, now that the certainty as the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. His sist...\nThe attitude of the people was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she insulted him to explain to him what had caused his abrupt c0nduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, to ruin himself on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to the least of his progress? Maybe his sister was weary by him. But if he had to brook hjs take an oath, ond divulge hif suspensions, who would believe it? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but deatb, he recalled, had already been m0cked. For days, hc remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw one, and ate only when hjs sjstcr came, who, with oyes ftreaming with teors, begged him, for his own good, to support the naturc. Finally, he is no longer able to withstand the calm and solitvde, he left his house, wandered rue fram à streot, anxious lo to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he won, as often exposed to midday sun as to thomidnigbt humidity. He was no longer to be rocked; first, he was riding in the house, but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for security, employed people for the full0w; but they were s0on dlstanded by him who fled from a sucr swifter lhan anything—srom thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck wilh the idea that hc 1efl by his absencc tbe whoo of his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter the society again, and to watch him closely, anxiovs to prewarn, iri fmite of his oath, al I that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and gloomy gazes were so striking, the hjs mingling so visible, that his sister finally undertook to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that so strongly affected him. When, blindly, the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to interpose, and,\nAs for the fact that his mind was becoming oleous, they thought it was high time to regain confidence that had been imposed upon them previously by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering he had experienced in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye those marks of which they c0nsided solly, they asked a doctor to reside in the dung, and to take care of him constanl. He hardly took notice of it, so complete was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His inooherence was finally so great that he was confined to the bis chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to wake up. He had eclipsed himself, his eyes bis had stirred up to a glazed chandelier;—the only sign of affection and recollection was manifested on the entrance of the bis sistcr; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands to ber, with glances that asphyxiated him, he wanted her not to touch the hiin. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love is against me, don't come near him!\" When, h0wever, she enquires to whom he referred, his answer on him wos, \"True! Trve!\" Arid again, he sneaks into a slate, from which he could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and his mind threw osf to portj0n of his morosity, while his guards observed, lhclt several times in the day, he counted on his firigers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, wben, the last day of theyeclr, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, when his sister wos went the next day to get married. Immediately, Aubrey's attenton was attracted; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this darkness of return intellect, which they feared was deprived of, they mentioned the name of tho Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by the expression of his intention to be present at the nuptiols, and wishing to see his sister. They didn't answer, but iri a minute fcw hissister was him wilh. He was apparently again capob1e to be offended by the influence of his love1y Fmile; f0r he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He 6egan to talk about all his warmth, and to congratulate her on his marriage with a delusional person for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a 1 poet on his chest; open it, this wos bis surprised to see the appearance of the wbo monster had flooded his lfe so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramplc under soot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbaride, he looked as if he did not stop him — by grasping his haries, arid looking at her with afrantio expressiori of coventenance, he made swear that she would never have been able to marry this monster, because he — but he could not progress — remembered if this rogue still reminded him of his oath — he turned back svdderly r0und, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and yet it was only a return of his disorder, bewitched, and enchanting Miss Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees for them, implored, begged them to delay but sar onc day. They, attributing this to the folly that they imagined mistaking possesslori of his spirit, tried to pacify bim, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvcn had called in the morning after the drawing roam, and had been repressed with the ury another. When he heard Aubrey's bad holly, he easily understood to be the cause of it; but when he learned that ho was in a mad mood, his exultatiori and pleasure were hardly confused with those among whom he had spoiled this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of a great affliction far away the brother and jnlerest in his destiny, gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. What could resist his power? Histonguc had dangers to tell: he could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, who wanted her to whom he addressed;—could say how, if he knew her, his existence, had had hegun to seem worthy of conservation, except that he could Iisten to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpcnt, or this was the will of destiny, that he had won his affections. The title of the eldest branch fell to him in the long run, he obtained an important emclssy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe screening officers, but to Vclin. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, af she appreciated her own happiness, her honor, on the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their backs as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that mclrigage, on which he denunce the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but when he gave him to the doctor, he did not do so to crush Miss Avbrey's spirit more and more by, what he considered to be, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the prisoners occupied with the dung; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than endowed, riots of the occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of carriclges brokc vone his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants of Iast wercame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving hjm in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seizes the opportunity, with a related was off the road, and in a moment fovnd hjmself in the apartment where all were almost boned up. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his clrm by force, satisfied him with the r0om, without ardour. On the stairs Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear: \"Remember your oath, know that, if she is not my fiancée today, Yaur's sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his allies, who, awakened by the old wmon, came looking for him. Aubrey could not support himself; his rage not finding Will, had broken a vase of blood, and he was thrown into bed. This was not begged to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriogc was sold, and the bride and husband left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey irioreased; blood effvsion produced symptoms of tho approaching death. He wanted the guards of his sjster to be healed, and when the hour of midnight had struck, he described in a composite way what the reeder had perpetuated, he died immunously after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey, but they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, Aubroy's sister was thirsty for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORDBYRON RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was all before hjm,wherc lo choose a place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, wc placed in the port of Mitylene, in the island 0f que dwarf. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables still to be found, led many British ships to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it was rather out of lbe trclck for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums paid a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in the watcring, and the merchant of the money of the breeding of the nati-\nThe clergyman and I took a ramble from Homer's cave school ca1led, and other rooms, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lion, who left the island four days before his arrival in his folucco. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Grcek, \"and would have taken me with a hiin; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He's a weird man, but he's very good. The cotlage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to the hive, and he left a man of the man of Iri oharge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for jt, (aboul L250 English currency,) and resided there abfit fourteen months, lhough not constantly; for he saisiSi in his felucca vcry oftcn to the various islets.\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time hastening in the house where our castryman bcld resided. We were kindly roceiued by an old man, wbo led us on the mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sittirig lounge and a bathroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply dormant: green waltzes, marble tables on each side, a rnyrtle barley in the o entree, and a small oven underneath, which could be made to play through the branches by renovating a spring fixed in the sidec of a branze Venus smail in a bent posture; a large coucb ar sofa completed the tho furniture. In the room there were half a dozen chairs of Engljsh caries, and an empty library: there was no mirror or single painting. The bcdchambre had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we kept a morble corner, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whoooh were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but the medical riot thinks that we juvstified ourselves by examining the content. On the tablet of the recreation 1ay Voltoire's, Sbakspeare's, Boileau's and Rousscau's complete works; the ruins of Ernpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kot2ebue; the play of Schiller's af the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Losl, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma jn1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, bul no book in English of any description. Most of these books were siiled wilh margi-\nnal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian clnd Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which also remarks were made.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had 6th reading the books of Thesc in the evening, so he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otbers; but, he said, they must lie about his return; for he is so special, he was carrying a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. Once I made him a servile; and I have the product of this farm f0r the boredom of the lock-off cclre ofit, except twerity zcchlnes which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides jn a sinall cabin in the wood, and which the lord crushed of Adrianop1e; I do not kn0w for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the outer nozzle was raining. The p0rtico at the front was fifty steps long clnd wide fourtecn, and the pillars in canned marble with lock plinths and fret work cornices, (as it is now custoyincry in Greek architecture,) were consideredab1y higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful Turkish carpet, under an awning of strong c0arse lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus smoked, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking iri, light wines drnkking, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", moving fruits, clnd enjoying the evening bree2e.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the haus, the brook asmal1 glided, the grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seal with an ornamental wood back was placed, on the whilch was told, the lord pclssed many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he was very pious, and that he always attended our Twico church for a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird-eyo view.\" A line of os ricb vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A sinall stream from the ruins descended from the broken waterfalls of iri, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea sm00tb in glass, spanning a horizon darkened by a single cloud, rmines the view in front; and a little to the left, trouffing a high vi sta 0f of hazelnut and pa1m-trees, feveral small iflands carried distinctly observed, emerald the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our enquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name bis but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Candja. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, bvt on our return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had bit young storks when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding feast. Hc gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these art-\nIce cubes. He also bought a boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, arid he often gave Greek Testarnents to poor children. In sbort, it appeared to us, fram all that we collected, at Havc was a very accerilic charaoter arid benevalent. A circumstance we learned, wbich our old friend at the cottage deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a very benevolent daughter, with whom the Lord often walked on the shore of the sea, and he had made him a piano-fortch, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the irformation with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Milylene; aur imagination everything on the rack, guessing who this ramber at Grecce could be. He had rnoney it was obvious: he had a disposition philanthropy, and all the tbose eccentricities that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fal1ing in the company of Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips an island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" Wc had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we were a few years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put in our hands we recognized the recile of Calcla in every page. Did we not regret not being curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idec to return to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of her seigneury, which was grossly clumsy. He has been described as an insensitive disposjlion, averse him to human nature, or contributing in any way to bleeding his sorrows, or to adding to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, cls can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finest feclings of the coffin, so elegantly scrutinized in his seigneury's poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and tenacity seem to spoil all his actions; and his courteousness, the repugnance of salitude, is an additional reason that irritates him as an ori being whose heart the Religion sealed, and on whose head Bérivolence cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. Wilh respecl to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opiniori. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the mora1 integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where I must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's cbaracter is worthy of genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, FIeet Street.",
    "37": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Williain Polidorl\nTHE superstition on which this tale is sounded so general in the East. Among Arabianf tbe he oppears to be common: he does not extend, howeuer, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; he did not assume his present before from the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at the time when the idea becomes dominant, that a body of Latiri could not abort if it was buried in their territory, he gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from the jr graus, and nourishing vpon tho blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorcline, where there was a belief, that vampyres were soaking night after night some of the blood of the victims of TBE, who became emaciated, lost their strength and died quickly of consumption; while these human blood suckers were weakened, and the vines were distracted from such a state of repulsion, so that the blood flowed all the passages of the bodies and even the pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curiouf, and, of course, crediblc accomunl of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the tho c0mmander-in-chief and the magisterials of the plccce, they stated positively and unambiguously, that about five years 6 then, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, trot, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had four times a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyre, and rubbing himself with his bipod. This precaution, archaic, did not prevent him from frowning a vornpyre bimself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a custodian was made, that fovr perfons had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other malice, the inhabitants who hated their Hadagni, took the body and found it (as it can be assumed in vampyrism cases) secreted, completely free of corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose and ears, pure and florid 6lood. As the evidence was thus worked out, TBey resorted to the usual remedy. A slclke was drjvcn entirely through Arnold Paul's art and hody, where it is reported for bave also shouted terribly as if he had bcen alive. Thls dorie, thy ass on his head, burned his badger, and threw the ashes into the grave bis. The same measures were adopted with the same people who died of vampyrifm, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal beliof is, that a porson sucked by a vampire 6th comes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is relativated here, because it seems to be suitable girdling to julustrate the subject of the prescent observations any other cases that might be presented. In many parts of Greecc it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime commilted wbilst in existnco, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced t0 to limit his infernal visits only to those beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A suppasition alludes to tbo \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre did, thy corsus shall frame his tear; then shall thou haunt the native plaa, and suck the blood of thy seed: there of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the slrcan of life; and yet hate the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, yet be lhey exhale, Sholl knew the devil for their fire: as cvsingthee, thou cursed them, Thy flowers are inlaid upon the stcm. But he who, for your crime, must be fail, the youngest, the most loved of all, 6less than the name of a father: This word shall envelop the heart in flaming! But you must be angry, and you must mark the last mooring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and let the ridiculed look see Who freezes or his lifeless blue; Then, with the urihallowed hand will tear the braids of his ycllow hug, of which, jn lives a lock when the tender offering of affection has been carried—But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! Yet, with your best drop bl0od sball; your gnasbing tool, and the lip of haggard; then hunting for ly suIlen falls, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors of Jn shrink from spectrum more cursed than they.\nMr. S0uthey has aiso intr0ducod in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vain Corsica of the young Arab Onei2a, who is presented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting him whom she loved while in existence. But it cannot be assumed that they are the result of the sinfulness of hcr life, being reversed throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of severa1 amazing cases of vampyrifm, to which he prelended ta have been on the wilness; and Calmet, in his great w0rk on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and the lradiary iIllustrative narratives of its effects, presented some leorinated dissertations, tending lo to prove that it is a classic, as well as barbaric error.\nMany interesting curiovs and opinions on this singularly borrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, arid which can now be concluded by merely pointing out, that the term Vampyro is the ane in in inost general acceptance, there are several other synonyms wilh il, makes use of in vclrious parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT occurred in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, it occurred to the various parties of the chiefs of tbe tone a n0bleman, more noticed for his singularities, than his rank. He watched the mirror abort him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fake attracted his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it aros e: s0me attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, sixirig up0n the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a look your pierce through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the houses; he began to see the hive, and those who had been used to vi0lent excited, and now selt the weight os onnui, were happy to have something in their presence capclable to engagitig their attention. In the assile of the mortal emotion of her fac, that neuer gairi a hot tlnt, quote from the blvsh of modesty, 0r of the strong emotion of passlon, although his form and beyond were beautiful, many women horirers swollen notoriety tried to gain his attonations, and to win, at least, some inorks of what they might call the affliction: Lady Mercer, who had been the monster of the ovcry inockerie had worn ln drawing-roomf since the marriage ecr, threw ber in his way, and did anything but put on the dress of a montebank, to stir up her opinion:—lhough in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently cling to her, it still seemed that they were not wearing;—even her incomprehensible impudence was strenched, and she left him fleld. But the common adult could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was ferenl jndif to him: yet this was the apparent cotlon with which he spokc to the virtuoso woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever addressing the femalcs. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it was sur-being the fear of his chantIclr cabaracter, or that they were moved by his clpparent hatred of vice, being wos so often omong these women who boast of heir sex srom their domestic virtues, as among those he shuddered by vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in Cbi. Left also to himself by guards, who first have them just to take care of his fortune, wbi1e they reviled him D the most important chargc of his mind to the care of the svboltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than the judgment hjs. So he had a great romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins so many fears of milliriers. He believed a11 to fympathize with uirtue, and yet this vice was thrown into Providence simply for the picturesque infection of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery os cl cottage was simply iri the garment, which were warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the palnter by their irregular folds on vclrious colored spots. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of the ponies were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, on his penchant in gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or snoring savorites: the girls at the same time, by their behind-the-scenes brjghting as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merjt. Attached as he was to the r0mance of his solitary hours, it was started1 at blinding, that, cxcept in the tallow and waxy candles thor flickered, not of the prosence of a ghost, but of lack of snuffing, there was no basis in the real life for any af that gathers pleasant images and descrlptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his glow. Findlng, however, s0me compensation in his graced benevolence, he was on los abandoning his dreams, when extraordinarytho being we described above, the orosse in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, thcln the assent tclcit lo their existence, implicitly by the audience of thoir oantact: allowing his imagination t0 image of each thirig who f1attated his propness to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object tbis as hero of a romclnce, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than tho person before him. He acquired himself with him, paid him atteritions and, until now, advanced his opinion vp0n, that his presence was always recognized. He learned grudgingly that Lord Rvlhven's business was wearing emborafsed, and soon his, according to notes of preparation in — Street, that he was abhorred to travel. Desiring to obtain some information, listing the singular charaeter, which, for many generations, had taken hold of its curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which, for many generations, thought it necessary to include young people in order to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards the establishment of a state of mind for the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as faileri of the sky, whenever scandalous indrigues are ionized as subjects of pleasant praise, according to the degression of the competence that is to be carried. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his lritcntions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from behind a prop0sal to join him. He was moving away from him such a mark of esteem, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it gldly, and in a few days they had passed the waters circumstantiated.\nSo far, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now hc has found, lhat, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered coricluslons different from the motives appear to his conduct. His eompanlon was profuse in his liberality;—the idle wanderer, the wanderer, and the beggar, received srom his hand more tban enough to relieve tbcir immediate needs. But Aubrey could revolt by pointing out, that it is not about the virtual, reduced to indigence by the msfortunes even assisting on virtue, that he gave his alms; — tbese was sent from the dorm with sneezes barely removed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to fulfill his desires, but to allow him to wall up in his lust, or to sink even deeper into Bis iniquity, to be sent far to the spirit of rich charity. It was, rainbow, attributed by him to the greater importunity of vicjous tbe, which generalizes the advance on the retirement of the virtuous indigent. Thero was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still bitten by his spirit: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where he was passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent arduousness with which his companion fought for the centres of all modelable vices; there he cried out in all the spirit of the faro lable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and theri he lost even more than he earned; but it was always with the same face of unhangjrig, with the whicb he generally looked at the arovnd society: it was not, however, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a large family; then hls very desire seemed strong-\nthe law of one — this apparent abstractctednesf of the spirit was 1aid set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while mourning with the mouse half dead. In each down, hc left the youth formerly rich, t0rn of the circle he looked, cursed, in the solild of a dvngeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; while rnany a father sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes scattered from silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his last immense wealth, whroughith to huy evcn sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, tbe last golder, he had just pulled himself out of the convulsion five taken from the innocent: this could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most expiating. Aubrey often seized him to represent him, and begged him to resign from this charity and plea which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to own his own proflt;—but He dislodged him, for on the day he hopped his friend woveld give him somc opportunity af speaking frankly and timely to him; h0weuer, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his career, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, being obsessed with her no greater gratification than the touching excitement 0f voinly wanting to break this mystery, whipping to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernaturai.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion; he allowed him to attend every day the marning circle of an Italian countess, as he went in search of the memorials of another deserted almosl city. While he was engaged, letters came from England, which he exhaled with acute impatience; the first was frowned his sister, breathing nothing of affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonished him; had he previously entered into iriolo his imagination that there was an evil power in his companion, the seome to give him sufficient reason to believe. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and exhorted, that the bis character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powcrs of seduction, made his licencable habits more dangerous t0 society. It was discovered bad, he was able to fight for the bad adult not 0riginated in the hatred of the hor character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his vlctim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of the urisulized virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatjon: in the end, the thosos women who were sought, apparently on the agreement of their virtue, had, since his departure, even threw the mask at the help, and had not scrupulously exposed all their vices to the gas public e.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the wbose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon him completely, purge, in the sense, to watch him inornate closely, and not to let pass any slight Circvmstances by urinotism. He entered the same circle, and soan pcreived, which his Lordship endorsed to work until the inexperience of the lady's daugbter he frequented in the house. In Itoly, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is in society; there is an obligation to wear her plaris in secret; but Au6rey's eye has followed bim iri all her windings, and soon he has foiled an assigration bid becn appojnted, which would end the most ljkely in the ruin of an inri0cent, the ovgh girl without thought. Losirig did not have time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his iritentioris with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet hcr thal the same night. Lord Ruthven replied that his interitions were such that he believed that everything would go without an opportunity, and that after having been preferred if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that he should disappoint at that time that he was accompanying his Lordshlp in the remainder of the proposed visit, he ardently his servant to look for another apartmentf, and by calling the lady's mother, informed him of AlI il kncw, not only with the requisition to his daughter, but also by styling the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; but he did not insinuate any suspicion that he had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey took his steps towards Greece, and crossed the Peninfula, quickly found himself in Athens. He then fixed his position in the house of a Greek; and soori himself took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of ancient gl0ry on monuments which, apparently, had darkened themselves to chronicle the acts of the freemen only before the slaues, had set themselves as a pledge under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the modcl for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of faith in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that none of them could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, oria would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who could have extirpated her eyc, apparently the eye of the arimal natvre, for this luxury smelting lo0k of the animal avit, but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accampanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would be the inconceivable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, floating like he wire Upori the wind, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the milks that he has just decipted on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often her tressos would fall, while she wilted arourid, exhibited in the ray of the sun tbe svch delicately shiny and swistly discoloring dyes, he migbl well excuse the sorgetness of the antiquarian, who lev escape from his reindeer even the very object that he had before thought of the vital iportance to the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why the charms that all the expense, but none appreciate?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, disused by crowded drawing rooms arid stisling balls. While he was drawing these remains of whoh he wanted to preserve a memorial for hjs suture hours, sbe would be st and by, and look at the mclgic effects of his pcncil, iri trace tbe scenes of his nalive place; she would then describe to him the circular dance vpon the plclin open, painted, to him in all the colors gl0wing of the Yautbful memory, the marriage pump sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and lhen, turning to subjects that had obviously made o more imprefion on his mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His sincerity and his faith in what she told exasperated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and of the dear bonds, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful snooze to prolong his existence if there were morithes, his hlood would run coid, while he tried to laugh at it from these idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cied at hlm thc names of men, who had finally detected one living among them, after many of their parents and children had been found to be marked with the seal of the fiend's appetite; and that she found him to be his jnoredullous, she begged him to believe, for he had been, noticed, that these wbos had doubted to question the exjstcnce, always had proof that forced them, with pain and heart, to confess it. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monfters, and his horror was unbelieving, hearing a protty ecvrate descriptian from Lord Ruthven; however, he still persuaded by persuading her, that there could be no truth in his fears, at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey hegan to cling himself to bits and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so counterfeited with all the affected virtues of the TB women among whom one had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, mclrry-\nHe was even more attached to the most a1 fairy shape before the hjm. Hc was tearing himself to the timos of her, and, forming a plan for some antiquari a search, he decided not to return until bis objoct had been ottentated; but he always found impossible of six his ottention on the rvins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that sows only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unrecognizable of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. Shc always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite heavings, while her guardian was busy in the skelching or deportation of a fragment that had yet escaped the time of the structural hand. She wrongly appealed to her parents on Vampyres's suffering, and they b0th, with seueral present, affirmed their existence, palo with horror in the name vory. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to hold on to one of his oxen, which was to detach him for a few hours; they heard the name of tbe placo, all of a sudden he hastened not to return to the vicinity, for he had to necessarily pass by a wood, wccre no Greok or to stay, aftor the day had closed, on clny consl deration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nativity orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made light of the reprobations of lheir, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he put on them with the fhudder in hls so daring to mock a fuperor, an infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, was silent.\nThe next morning Au6rey went on his excursion without lingering; ho was surprised to obsess the melanoholic face of the host bis, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly prayed to him to return, and the night allowed to put the power of the lhese beings jn actjon;—ho promjsed. However, he was so busy in the search for hjs, that he only pereejve the light of day would soon end, and tbat on the horizon there were of these flies whoooh, in the warmer climates, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage over the devolved country.—He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined your make-up by the speed for his delcly: bul it was too late. The twilight, in the unknown alm0st of these elitams to the south, sets immediately the sun, the night begins: and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — it echoed thunders had fcarcely a resting interval — its heavy thick rain forced its entanglement to fall the foliage of the canopy, while the blue forked lightning seemed to fall engulfed radiate at its own feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of ljghtning, it was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose from the massif of dead leaves and the wood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a somo to guide the hive towards the city, or at least relying on the oblain sholter frorn thc pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders of a silent mountain allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with him, suffocating, exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in a smileful arm0st unbrokeri;—he was surprised: but, awakened by tbe thundor who rolled again on his head bis, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the But it's true. He sent him down into darkness; but the noise guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for he called, and the sounds continued, and no no nolice was taken from him. He himself sounds in contact with someone, whom he immediately grasps; when a voice shouted, \"Again basfled!\" And he lay down himself, struck by him whose superman was strong, determined to sell his life as dearly as possible, he wrestled; he beat in vain; he was lifted up with fram bisfect and cast him with enormous force against the ground; his enemy fell upon himself, and knelt on his chest, and knelt his hands on his throat, when the brightness of many torches penetrated through the thclt thct thct gave Eight in the day, disturbed hlm; he rose up tirelessly, and levv-\nHe rushed through the do or, in a rnoment, the crushing of the branches, as he crossed the wood, was not 1onger hea rd. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to m0ving, was soon heard by the thosc without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the wall of the inud, and the thatch loaded on any individual straw with heavy soot flakes. Al the desire of Aubrey lhey sought for her who had attracted him to his crjes; he wclf agairi left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the 1-ighl of the torches once again burst him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a Corsica lifelesf. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was only a vision that came forth fram his troubled imagination; but to be again seen the shape some, when he unlocked them, stretched by the hif side. There was no color on his cheek, no evcn on his Iip; yes, there was dizziness about his foe which seemed almost as attached to the life that once inhabited the threshing:—pon his neck and broast was blood, arid on his thraat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:— for the men poiriled, crijng, simultaneously strvck with horror, \"To Vampyre! A vampire!\" A l itter was quackly formed, and Aubrey was loid by the fidelity of her who had recently been the subject of so many brilliant and faired visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in hcr. He did not know what the thoughts were: his mind was tainted with arid seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy—ho held almost unconsciously in his hclnd a naked dagger of a particular constructiori, which had been found in the cabin of lho. They were welcomed by various parties who were engaged in the search for the ber that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city of Lho, preceded the parents of a terrible cotastrophe. —T0 describe the sorrow that would be possible; bvt when Ihey determined the causo of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the corsc. They were unconso lable; both died in the heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in sc the intervals would be called to Lard Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a certain uriaecounlable combinatiori seems to be beg from his former companion to spare the binge he loved. At other times, he imprecato curses on bis beads, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his permanent guardian. When he withdrew from his delirium, he was h0rrjfied and flourished at the sight of hjm whose image had now been combed with that af at Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, almost repentant irnply for the fail which had caused tbeir separation, and even more by the attentiori, clnxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled his presence. His lordsbip swollen quite; he appeared only the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalcence began to be rapid, he agajn grclduly retlred in the sarned state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, except that it was only at the very moment that he was surprised to meet his gclze fixed on him, with an af malicious smile exultatjon playing on his lips: he did not know wby, but this smile haunted him. Duririg, the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves without tides agitated by the cooling breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbf, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes to all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elastia of the spirit that had once so distinguished him riow seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silene as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; he drew her out of the ruins he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe sto od by his side—jf to be sought in the w0ods, his light step approaching in the middle of the Ood d'uriderw, in qvest of modest purple tho; theri svddenly lunning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his palo arid face throat wounded, wjtb a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rvthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from hjm during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece neilher had again seen. They traveled in all the diroclions, searching for each place to remember a memory; but although they hastened from one place to another, they did not shake to hear what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, when they imagined that they were just over a million people. As a result of this neglect, the council of the inhabitants, on one occasion they used only a few vards, more to serve as guides than as a reference. On entering, however, a narrative defilement, at the bottom of which was the heel of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the Negro precipices, they had reason to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly any wholo of the party swallowed up in its narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, and by the ratio exhumed of several cannons. In an iristarit their guards had loft thcm, and, standing behind the rocks, had bcgvn to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitatjng lheir for example, withdrew for a moment behind the shcItering turn of defilement: but hard to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shuls told them advance, and being exposed to the slaughter without mercy, if clny thieves should climb up and take them back, they determined to one to rush in search of tho onmy. Hardly had they lost shelter from the rock, that Lord Ruthven received a shot in tho shovlder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistant; and, no long or attention to competition or his own peril, is soon surprised by shaking the faces of the rabbis around him — his guards having immediately thrown their arms at Lord Ruthven's wounded.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after receiving a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, being content simply to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised surne, for which he hcld an order. Lord Ruthven1y's rapid strength diminished; in two days death was made, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and apperance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had had objocts about him: hut towards the near afth last night, his spirit b ecame apparently unosy, and his eyc oflcn fixed on Aubrey, who was prompted to offer his help with more than usual solicitude—\"Help me! You can get me drunk – you can do more than that – I don't mean life rny, I've listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would like to do anything,\" replied Aubrcy.\"I need, but few things — my life flourishes — I do not explain the quilo — but if you hide everything from me, my candy was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I—but life. \"-\"We don't know him. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him up with an exultant violence; \"Swear that your soul may resent, with all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, without you giving your knowledge of my crimes or dates to any living being, in any way whatsoever, of what can happen, or of what you can see.\" \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he was running down the pillow, he was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; there were many circumstances that saw his knowledge with the man, and he did not know why; and when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if, from the presentation, something horrible were waiting for him. In the morning, he was almost 0 to enter the houel in which he had licked the corpse, when a thief met him, orid informed him that it was no longer tbere, having been transported by his sons and eomradcs, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, that he would have exposed himself to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his deatb. Aubrey stunned, and took several of the men, discouraged to g0 and buried it on the toad where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no traco or body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the same stone on which they had laid the body. For some time his mind was amazed in the conjeoturef, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible unhealthys, and iri who apparently got involved in this superstitious melancholy that seized his mind, he resolved to love him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to organize these effects with him 6th1origing lo Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several offone bone weapons, m0re or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There was Sever al daggersand ataghans. Whjlst turned them towards, and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise to find a wreath apparently adorned in the same style as tbe dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hasteri to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he had climbed, tbough pecul-\nIn good shape, he held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty — they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted dlsbelicve; but the particular shape, the same tjnts variable on the haft and sheolh were similar in splendor on b0ème, and for fear that there would be no room for doubt; there were also 6lood drops on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations wero c0ncernirig the lady whom he had tried to snatcb from Lord Ruthven's seductjve arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortuno ruined, and she had not heard of him since the departure of her lordshlp. Aubrey's spirit almost broke under horrors so mony repeated; he was afraid that the tbis lady had fallen victim to Ianthe's destroyer. He bocams morose and slender; and his only oonisted profession by exhorting the speed of postilions, just as he will save the life of someone he has held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tossed bim on the banks of the Englisb; and he hastened at the house of his fathcrs, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the foot. If she made sure, by the irifantine caresses, had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMlss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eye and applauded the salon's ossemblies. Thero was not of this light shine that only comes out in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was illuminated by the levity of the heneath spirit. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from misfortune, but from a feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. Its step is not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can alternate – it was sedated and pensive. Nothing but Wheri, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when ber bouilloncr brea thod to her affection, and would be in her presence forget those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have cxchanged hor smi1e for that of the volvptuary? It seemed that jf these eyes, — the tbat face then played in the light of their own native sphcre. She was still only a sting, and had not been introduced to the world, he had been thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed upon the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now, for that reason, that the next living room, which approaches quickly, had to be the cpach of its entry into the \"bvsy scene\". Aubrey wou1d rather hove remained in the house of his sathers, and had had enough of the melancholy that carried him away. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolities of the fashionable stranger, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had seen; but ho determined to saterify his own comfort to the pr0tection of his sister. They came into town, and prepared for Tbe the next day, which hcld boen announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive – a riot that had been rioting for a long time, arid all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account everything that aborted him, he undertook to remember that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was there, feeling suddenly sawn by his arm, and a voyce he was feeling too well, sounded in his ear--\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, for he saw a spectre exploding him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place until his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs refused to carry the weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriagc, and wcls led home. He passed the room with pressed steps, crouched his hands on his head, af if he feared that his thoughts would weaken with his hrain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, ho could not believe that it was possible — the dead are resurrected again! — He said that his imagination had conjured the Imago on which his mind rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back into sooty; for he intended to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights after wjth bis sister to the assemble of a close relationship. Leaving hor under the protection of o matriori, ho retired into a rocess, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many people were waking up, he woke up and entered Anolher's room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. And he took the arrn of his sistcr, and with a leap he forced it to the artery; and at the gate he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, he heard this voice murmuring with him again: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He did not turn to television, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to his house.\nAubrey was almost djstracle. If before his mjnd was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely was he riddled, now that the certainty 0f the living agony of the monster has pressed on his thoughts. The attention of his sistcr was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that the sbe intimidated him to explain to him what had used his abrupt conduct. He said only a few words, and these terr...\ndefied her. He's more disconcerted than he is. His oath began; — was he then to roam, sobbing on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid progress? His sister could have been naked by him. But even if he were yours to break his oath, and to break his fuspicions, who would be a swallow? He thought of using his own hand to free the world has shaken such misery; but death, he remembered, hcld beeri already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only his sister Eame, who, with tears suffocating eyes, begged Bim, for her, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear stilitude and loneliness, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, eager to steal this image that haunts him. His dreams have become neglected, and he wanders, also often exposed to midday thc on the Wets of Midriight. It was no longer to be recognized; at the first hc return with the evening at the house tho; hut at the paw hc dropped it down to rest wherever fatigue exceeded hjm. His sister, anxious for his safety, used people lo to follow bim; but they were soon deciphered by bim wbo flcd of a faster pvrfuer anything — of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence all his friends, with a fiend among them, were left with the presence so unconscious as they were, he decided to enter society again, and to look at him olosidely, anxious in advance, in spjte of his oath, a1l that Lord Ruthven appr0ached with inli-\nIt's Macy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and rogue gazes were so frustrating, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg lo abstclin to seek, for her, a society that touched the hive so strongly. When, h0wever, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the guards bartered proper to inlerpofe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, TBey thought it was high time to regain that trust that had previously been imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nChallenged to save bim from the wounds and chokings that he had daily in his wonders, and to prevent him from expasing these marks of what they were insanity to the general eye, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and took care of him constantly. He hardly seems to notice, so he gives himself the mind absorbed by the terrible subject of 0ne. His incaheronce 6 is finally so big, that he was confined to his room. There, he could often lie for days, unable to be awake. He bcld became emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and recollection left was shown upside down the entrance of his sistcr; then he would be caretaking to begin, and, taking hold of his hands, it seems that he allegedly offended him, he wanted her not toouob. \"Oh, touch him at the riot, if your love resents me, come near him!\" Wheri, however, sbe asked wbom he mentioned, his only ariswer was, \"True! True!\" And he fell back into a slate, from which she didn't even drive it. This lost many morithes: gradually, however, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and his inind threw from cl portiori os his morosity, wbilst his guards observed, that several times in the day he counted upori his finger an infinite nvmber, then smiled.\nTho's time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with bis doctor vpon the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, when if sister would laugh day to get married. Instantly Aubrey'f attention was drawn; he asked anxiously whom. Happy with this mark of intclcct, which they feared had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Mclrsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he had met in society, Aubrey seemed bent, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be pre-sent clt tho nuptials, and eager to see his sisler. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his check, wet with tears, flowing the idea that his brother was once again alive to the feelings of afsection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distyngued from far arid rank accompllshment; wben he suddenly perccivod a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to spoil the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his life. On his question hlm why he thus destroyed the appearance of her fvtvre husband, he looked as if he had not underestimated her — then by taking hold of her hordes, arid looking at her with a frantic expression 0f couritenan this, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monster, because he — but he could not advance it — he was paid as if this voice told him to remember his ooth again — he turned abruptly ravnd, thinking that Lord Rut hven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the pbysician, who had heard the whole, and who thought it was only the return of his djsorder, entered, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, told hor to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, begged, begged to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the madness they imagined having seized his doctor, eventually pacified him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvenhad called Tbe morning aster the living room, and asked all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood to be the cause of it; bul when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be bardly concealed fr0m those among whom information had been obtained. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the hrether and interest in his destiny, he gradually became the ear of Miss Au6rey. Who could resist his power? His tongue has bad dangers and tools to tell—could speak of himself cls of an individual who had no sympathy with no eyes on the watered earth, savc with whom he was oddly glittering1f;—could say to the bow, since one knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, except thal that he was buzzing with his soothing accents;—in flne, he kncw so well that I know how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, thal he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (despite the state of his brother's state), which was to take place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicion and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she closed her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and hope of their hovse, to delay but for a few shovels that marriagc, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. Tbe servclnts promised that they would delirate him; but to give him to the doctor, he thought that he did not belt t0 haros plus the spirit af Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night stopped without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that can be more easily designed than described, the well-filled preparation notes. The morning came, arid the sound af carriages 6roke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cur-\nIosity of the servants finally ovorcamo their vigilance, lhey gradually stolo away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a bonded one was out of the room, and at the time was found in the trim where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, takirig his arm by force, satisfied him with the room, without a voice with fury. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear in the vice, \"Remember thy oa tb, and know, I am not my bride in the day by day, thy sjster is dishonored. Women are frajl!\" He said, \"Ho pushed him to the bis, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in seram from him.\" Aubrey could no longer stand; his rage, not finding it devoid, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was convaded in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he took off, as the doctor was ragged with hcr agitation. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left Londori.\nAubrey's ircreasity; blood shedding 0f produced symptoms of the near-dead 0f approach. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when the midnight hover struck, hc relatod compostdly what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guards settled down to proclaim Miss Aubrey; but when they grabbed, it was too late. Lord Ruthveri had disappeared, and Aubroy's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, GIVE A ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The wart was in front of him, where to choose his resting place, and Providence his guidance.\nE.\"\nIN Sai1 passing through the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, wo mis irito the port of Milylene, in the jslclnd of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables still have to be there, engulfed many British ships to visit it — both warmen and merchants; and although he is standing out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums amply reimburse for the violation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was used in watering, arid the purescr to the mercandirig for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and rnyfelf at 0k a rain to the cove callod Homer Schoo1, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a narrated srall) we met the engaged clnd a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our clrial in his fclucua. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would raise me lakri with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river lhc, belongs to him, and he has 1ft an old man in the chclrge of him: he gave Dominick, to the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 Currency-\ny,) and has resided there about fourteen m0nths, but not constantly; for he sails in the hls fe1ucca very often on the different islands.\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity very much, and we did not lose timc iri hastily to the housc where our peasant had resided. We were well received by an old inan, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four oparlments ori lhe grovnd-sloor — an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting porlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious c1oset attached. They were all simply decorated: a light green wall, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fjxed spring in the side of the small Venus bronze iri a lean posture; a large hood or sofa completed the furniture. Iri the ha1I stood half an English dozon cane chairs, and an empty casc book: there were no mirrors, nor a single pajnting. The hedchamher had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with a cotton bed stuffed and a pillow, the corn bed throughout Greece. In the still, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books and papers, who were then in the chest of a great seam in the elosel: it wos open, but we did not think that the urscles justified to examine the content. In the recesf's tablet, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, of Rousseau are finished; the Rujns of the Empires of Volricy; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller af the Robbers; the Paradise of Mjlton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press ot Constantinop1e, very torn, but not English of any dowry. Most of the lhesis books were filled with marginal laughs, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The lord had read the books of the sc in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they must remain there until his return; for he is so pcltricular, that if I died a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I made him a fervice, and I made the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of it, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Arnenian who is redone in a small cottagc in the wood, and which the Iord brought here sr0m Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale.\"\nThe appearance of the externa1 bouse was pleasant. The portico at the front was long and wide, and the pil1ars of marble canned with black plinths and working cornice of frets, (as it is now the usual architecture iri Greek,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone balustrade, was covered with a sinus turkey carpet, under the ari store of strong Corsican linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, because on the Greeks spend their excesses in tobacco, drinking highl wines, such as \"lachryrna christi\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the breeze evenerig.\nOn the left, you enter the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and 1imcs were chained togethcr on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we said, the lord spent many bis evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, scribeg, and speaking to lusse1f. \"I begged,\" scli the old man, \"praying\" away he was devoted vcry, \"and always went to our church twice a week, in addition to Sun dclys.\"\nThe view of the Tbis seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries bloom iri, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A sinall room emitted by the rulns descended from the cascades of iri brokon, until it was lost in the forest near the baso de la morin. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the vlew in front; and a little on fear, through a view of 10fty cbesnut ond palm trees, small seueral islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emerclld grcen spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but aur cnquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the pcrson who had resided in this romantic soljtude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Caridie. \"The Armenian,\" said our condvctor, \"could he say it, but I am not sure that he is not,\" he said, \"and can you not say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial fcast. He gave a cow to the aneman, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weavig these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often ran the Greek Testaments for poor children. In the shorl, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstratory that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to discography. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was osten seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a piano-strong, and gave him the use of himself.\nThis was the information with wblch we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylerie; our imagnatioris everything on the rack, guess who this crawler in Greece could be. The money was obvious: he had a philanthropy of djsposition, and these eccentricities mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our duplicates were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been lrclvelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The undivided,\" he said, \"about whom yauare so anxjous, is Lard Byron; I met hjm in my trips to East1 and Tenedos, and I also visited him al Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every page. Did we not regret not having been more eriove in our research at the cottage, hut we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylone on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely insensitive, and in justice in the good name of her seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive device, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add its pleasures. Tbe fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their seat in his hosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his acities; and his wrath of the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon whose heart the Religion sealed his seal, and upon whose head the bath of Benevolence cast his coat. No man can read the pleasant precedlng \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a c0untryman. Wilh respects his love or pleclures, I do not assume the right to give an opiniori. Reports must be welcomed with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, Alono can censor the error of a confrere-morla1. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genlus. The surest testimony of a virtuouf he artes and of a self-approving coriscience is to go away in secret and avoid applause from the world.\nTHE END\nGillet, Pririter, Crown Court, FIeet-Street.",
    "38": "THEVAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Wllliam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which the tbis tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churehes; at the time the idea was predominant, that a Latin body would not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it increased gradually, and cultivated the subject of the wonderful stories rnany, still oxtarit, bone it died rising from their graves, and coding on the blood of the yaung arid beautjful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there were beliefs, that the uampyres soaked up some of the blood of their victims, that 0 became einacized, lost their strength, and died quickly os consumed; while tbese hurnan sucking fat blood—and their veins distended to such a stato of the repletion, as to cause the blood flow lo of all the passages of their body, and even the pores themselves of their skins.\nIn the L0ndon Journal, of March 1732, is an eurious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vclmpyrism, what is happening in Madreygcl, Hungary. He opposed the fact that, in the examination of the chief commander and the local mclgistrates, positively and unanimously asserted, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pau l, would have heard that, in Cassova, at the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a wcly to get rid of evil, by exhaling some bones from the earth out of the fat of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being heenmented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of ljfc by his ottacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and whole free of corruption, and emitting to movth, nose, and eclrs, pure florid 6lood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was cast entirely the heart and body of ArnoId Paul, where it is reported to hclve also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. Tbis did, cut his head off, burned his body, and threw the crampons into his grave. The same efforts were made to ensure that the corfes of these people who had precviously djed of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others that occurred.\nThe universal belief if, that a person sucked by o varnpyre bccames a vampyre itself, and sucks iri hjs turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis inconstructive rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations than any other instclence it might add. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a crime ommmjttedwhilst ommmjtwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only sentenced to vampyriso, but forced to corrify his infernal visits saily to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposlition alludes in the \"Giaour.\"\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from the tomb of them; and then hideously haunt the place of origin, and sigh the blo0d of all thy rod; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, A nridnjght drain tho stream of lisie; yet locltbe the banquet that performeth Muft feedeth thy ivid livlng oorse, thy victians shall still expiate, and shall know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest, thou cursest them, thy kidneys shall be dried upon the stem. But whoever dropped your crime, the youngest, loved everyone, will bless you with the namo of a father. This word will envelop your heart! Yet, you must put an end to your arid task marks the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see Whioh freezes his lifeless blue; Theri with the unhalifated hand tears The braid af his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the thorn of the affection-carried wcls engagement—But now is carried away by Shoe Memorial of thin agony! But if your best blood is flowing, your teeth grinning and your lip wreaking; then, tracking your tomb of sulleri, Go, and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in horror turn away from the spectre more cursed than they.\nSouthey also presented in his wild bvt beautiful poem of \"ThaIaba\", the vampyr corse of the young Arab Oneizcl, who is represented af having returned from the grave in order to torment him she loved better during iri existerico. But it is not supposed to have resisted the sinfulness of her life, it was poured into the narrative as a complete type of purity and jnnocence. The true Toumefort girds a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for what he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this svbject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and lradiary accounts illustrating the effects of itf, presented some learned dissertations, tending to proue it ta be a classjcal, as well as barbaric error.\nAlthough it is possible to add this singularly horrible superstition for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanction, and which can now be consolidated by the simple remblaking, thal although the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use of nade in different ports of the world: like Vroucalocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Br0ucoloko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the period of dissipation on a London victory...\nIt appeared to the various parts of the leaders of the tori a n0bleman, more noticed for its singularities, than its rank. He was watching the mirth clraund hlm, just as he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous oracle tied his waiter, which he scrambled by cl look qvell, and throw the sea into the breasts where the infidelities reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could explain the riot from where it aroso: somc attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, six on the face of the oject, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of leadership which weighed on the skin that he could pass. The peculiarities of Hjs prompted him to be invited to every hovsc; all wanted the seo, and those who bad beeri accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were ploased to have s0mething in their presence capable of engallng lheir attention.

But even if common adultery could not influence the direction of her eyes, jt was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent climax with which ho spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he never addressed the female. He had, however, the reputation of a Winnirig language; and if he was tbat it euen 0vercame fear of his sjngular character, or gglt they were moved by his apparently warm vice, he was also often among the women who make up the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young Geritleman named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left with an ordinary sister in possession of great riches, by priests who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most imporant charge of his mind lo the care of the subaltcrns mercenaries, he was more of his imaginative lhari his judgment. He had, therefore, this high Romclntic home of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many fears of millions. Hc believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria simpleIy for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply eonistrated in the garment, which were also hot, butwhlch were better suited to the painter'seyo by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, arid and rich.\nns, when he entered gay circles, many mothers were surrouding him, stretching who should describe with the least truth their languishing or scrambling favorites: the girls at a certain point, by the luminant faces when he approached, and by the gleaming eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in fae notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romonce of his s0litclry hour, he was surprised to find, that, except in the fallow and wax candles that flackered, not the presence of a ghost, bvt srom lacks snuffing, the era was not foundatlon in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant pictures and descriptions contained in these volumcs, from where he had formed his study. However, to find a componation in his gratified vanity is to be abhorrent to requisition his dreams, when the oxtrclordinary being that we described above, went through him in his career.\nHe looked at the bim; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man abhorred in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of extremal objects, which the tcleit acquiesced in their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of contact with lbeir: to allow his imagination to imagine what flattered the propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the thjs objcct in the hcro os a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his string, rather than the pcrson before him. He made himself known with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advariated on his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. Hc gradually learns that Lord Rutbven's osfairs have been embroiled, and soori found, from tho notes of preparation in — Street, tbat it was ahout at ttrovel. Desiring to obtain some information about the singularity of the latter, which, until now, had only shaken his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to tour, that it was considered necessary to hold on to the young people to take a few steps in the career of vjce in order to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to opt as lf fallon of the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of ploasantry ar of praise, according to the degree of skilI shewnjn by matching them ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of estoem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he welcomed him with joy, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had a bad chance of studying Lord Ruthvcn's character, and it is now found that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives of the hif conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; — idleness, vagaband, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing, that it was not on the virtuovs, reduced to indigenccc by the accompanying malfortunos, even on virtue, that he 6estowcd his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to waste in his lust, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This waf, however, attributed by him to the greatest irnportunity of the victim, which will generateIlly preval1s 0ver retirjng bashfulness of the virtuous indigenous. There was a circumstratory about the inheritance of the Lordship, which was even more impressive on his mind: all those on whom he was hestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse on it, because they were either ail led to lhc scaffold, 0r sunk to the lowest and the most abjecl misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his comparison sought the centres of all the sashionable vices; he entered there into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and he lost even more than what he earned; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which hc generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the young novice rashfu1 or the father without chance of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be f0rtune law – this apparent abstraction of mjnd was set aside, and his eyes split with more fethari thclt of the cat while wilting the mouse half dead. In every city, Helefl the old youth flocked, torn from the circle, he looked, cursed, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this wilt; while many a father big frenetic, in the midst of tbe speaking 1ooks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing af his late riches imrnenso, who are with to buy oven enough to satisfy their present desire. Yethe did not take remorse from the gamling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last dorlot which he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the innocen t: it could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to c0mber the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from thischarity and plea that proved the ruin of Cll1, ond did not make his own profit; — but he dilated it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the sneaky and open opportunity to speak to him; to bow, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his cligage, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; ond th0ugh Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not get to groat the grotification fr0m it than the constant excement of vainly wanting the escape mystery thal, whjch to his exalted imagination begari ta assumes the appearance of some hjng supernaturai.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his companion; he left him daily sitting in the morning cjrclc of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memories of another deserted city of Alinoste. While he was so engaged, the lethers came from England, and he opened with impatience; the fir came from his sister, 6 said nothing again to the effect of a bul; the others came from hif guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered into his imagination, there was an evil power resident of his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediate departure from his friend, and vrged, that his stalker c was terribly vicious, because it was the possession of irresistible powers of seductians, made his licencable habits more dangerous to focus. It had been discovered, that bis eonempt for adultery had not ordained in the hatred of his character; but lhal had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradatiori: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously to expose all the desolation of their vices, the public gaze.\nAubrey did not recommend lia-\nving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on whjch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to keep him away from the oltogelher, purposing, in the while way, lo to look at him inore ciosely, and not to let pass any circumstance sligbt without attention. Ho entered into the irito the circ1e sclme, and soon perceived, that his seigneury was striving to work vpon the inoxperience of the girl girl of the lady of which he mainly frequented houso. In Italy, jt so rarely that on the unmarried female is met with ln s0ciety; ho was therefore obliged to continue his planf in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered tal an assignati0n had been opioided, which would probably end in the ruin of on inn0cent, though unthinkable girl. Not losing time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked bim his intentions with respect your lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of being about to meet her tonight. Lord Ruthuen replied, that his interitions were such that he thought that everything would have had an opportunity in fuch; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decljne acoompaning his Lordship in the reminder of their tour project, he ordered his servant to sow other apartmerits, and calling to the mother tbe 0f lady, informed him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his goddaughter, but also cancering the character of his Lordship. The pre-truth wcls assignment. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; bul did not hijack any suspicion of his plans that had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nHav ing left Rome, Aubrey directed his step ps towards Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon he found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the bosom of a Greek; and soon he took care of the faded traces of ancient glory on inunumerits which, apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden themselves for the benefit of the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as himself, oxistcd a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a wjshi ng palnter to pour on tbo canvases promised the hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could lie down to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or tripped along the side of the inuntain, it would have been thought that gazellus a bad type of his beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the animated naturc eye, for this luxurious slecpy look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Avbrey in the hif search of antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of ka shmero butterf1y, show tbe all the beauty of his form, floccating as he was on the wind, lo the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on a dazzling almofl, in the contemplation of his figurc sylph-like. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so deliciously brilliantly shine and weakening swissly from the bushes, it could be that we excite the oblivion of the anllquary, which let escape from her mind the very object hc had before thought of the vile importanee to the correct interpretation of o passage in Pausanias. But if we try to describe chorms, but no one can appreciate it?—It was innocence, yovth and beauty, untouchable by overcrowded drawing rooms arid stif1ing ballf. As he drew the rcains from which he wanted to pass a memorial away from his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his notifying place; she would then describe to him the cjrcIing dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant col0urs of yoursful memory, the sherremembered marriage pump viewing inher infancy; and then, tvrnning to subjects who had had the euidential made a greater jmpression on the spirit of the ber, wovld tell him alI the supernatural tales of his nurse. Her gains and her belief applauded her for what she had set in, aroused the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, wbo had spent years in the midst of her hornets, the most dear arid ties, forced the excrement year, feeding on the lily of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the following months, hjs 6lood would be cold, while hc tried to laugh at her of such an idea and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had finally detected one living among them, after several bones their relatives relatius and evil children were found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fiend; and when she found bim so incredulaus, she begged him to believe, for he had been, noticed, that those who dared to coexist with existence, had always had proof that had forced them, full of sorrow and sorrow, to confess. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, stjll persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, lhough al lhe tjme wondered about the multitude of incidences that had all tended to excite a be1ief in the natural punctual power of Lord Rulhven.\nAubrey began to attach more and more hjmse1f to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted wjth all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision af romance, w0n his heart; and while being ridiculed the idea of a young man of English sapils, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he was still more and more attached to the almost fairylike form6before him. He sometimes ripped it from it, arid, forming a plan for an antiquarian reseclroh, he went away, determined not to return untjl bis object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentjon upori the rvjns arovnd him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his goods. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, arid was always the same frank lnfantile he had known for the first time. She always seemed to share it with the reluctanco; but it was the bccausc, she no longer had anyone with whom she could screw her fclvourite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering the fragment of somc whicb that had yet escaped the crow of the time. She had appealed to her porents on the subject of Vampyres, and they warm, with the present sooveral, affronted their cxistence, pale with horrary in the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, whieh had to hold him for a few hovres; if they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him not to return to laugh, os he must necessarily pafs thrugb a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the vampy tip station in their nocturnal orgies, arid annoyed the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to reject them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling with his daring, mocking himself with a superi0r, an infernal power, the same name bone which, at the time, had frozen their 6lood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey salt 0ff on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy sace of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrific waves, had inspired tbem with terror svch. When he was abovt to leave, Ianthe cclme beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, the night was all the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not see that the Lighl day would soon end, that in the hori2on there was one of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass of tremendouf, and pour all their rage up the devoted country.—He, however, finally climbed his horsc, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: but he wclf too late. Two fires, in these southern climatos, are almost unknown; immediately sunsets, bcgins at night; and then he had advanced far, the pow cr af the storm was above — his thunders echoed barely had a resting interval — heft heavy rain forced his way through the canopy foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate to very smelly bis. Suddenly his horso became afraid, and he was carried with the rapid dreadfu1 beat the entangled forest. The clnimai finally, through the fatjgue, stopped, arid he found, by the dazzling of the lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel lhat barely raised jt upwards of the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood that turned it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him, or to be confident to get a shelter against the storm of Tbe. As he approached, the thunders, for a sjlent momenl, allowed him to hear the terrible frieks of a w0incn mixing with the stifled laughter, exulting and mocking, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound; — he was surprised: bvt, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, opened the do0r of the hvt. He found himself in total darkness: the sonn d, however, sipped it. He was apparently not perceived; sor, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remark was made of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Again mocked!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by him whose strength the superhuman would hold: determined to sell his strong Iife, he was able to fight; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his sight and fasted with a great candle against the Grovnd: — his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands on his lhroat — when the brightness of many torchos penetrating the hole that gave llghl in the day, disturbed him; — he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at the moment when the crack of the branches, as he broke through the burber, was not heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the valleys of mud, and the thatched loaded ori each individual straw with heavy f1aks of soot. At Aubrey's will, they loved him who had attracted him to his screams; hc was again in the darkness; but what horror his horror, wben the light of the torches united more bursl on him, to perceive the aerial form 0f his beautiful conductor brought in a corse without life. He closed his cyes, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his disturbed iinagination; but he again sowed the same form, when he delivered them, stretched by his side. There was a rio color on his cheek, not even his lip, but there was a silence on his face that seemed to be the most attached of life that once lived in Tbere: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his lhroat were the marks of teeth having opened the veln: — to this men pointed, crying, simultaneously scared themselves of horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid next to her, who recently began to bimble the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in it. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously jn his bare hand dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the sea of her which a m0ther had missed. Their lamentable crics, as they approached the city, prevailed over the parents of a terrible catastrophe. — To defuse their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolab1e; both died in the heart of brokcn.\nAubrey 6eing pvt to bed was seized with a violent foam fever, and was often of theirious; in these intervals he called vpon Lord Ruthven and on Iantbe—6y an immeasurable combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he impretates the moledictlons on his pearl, the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, had the opportunity of tbis to orrive in Athens, and from what ver molive, upori audition of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, clnd became his companion of constancy. When the lattcr recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image was now accompanied by that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, almost implied repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care which he showed, so0n reconciled his presence. His seigneury seemed to change; it did not appear that the apathelio being wbo had so surprised Aubrey; bul af soan that the bis convalescence began at the 6th rapid, to be regraded in the same state of mirid bone, and Aubrey did not perceive any diference of the old mon, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a tern of malicious exultation playing his lips vpon: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tides of tides raised by the cool breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbfs, turning, like our world, the still sun;—indeed, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Au6rey, by this shock, was weakened by the mucb, and this spiral elasticity which had once so disconcerted it now seemed to have run away forever. He was as loving today as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wanted for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, the bo had freed himself, the shape of Ianthe stood next to hjs — if he sought him in the woods, his licker would appear wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then svddenly rovnd, would show, to wild imagination hjs, his paleness and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, all of which created such bitter oscillations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had taken from the hlm during his illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and which they had not yet seen. They traveled in the direction of the evocation, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached; but if they hastened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they imagined to be about the invention of the induidua1s, whose irony was to excite the generosity of those whom thcy defended against the supposed dangers. Due to the neglect of the residents' counsel, once they travel with only a few guards, more lo serve as guides than as defense. Upon entering, h0wever, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly any whole party engaged in narrow pclss, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the ecboed ratio of several cannons. In an insurrection, their guards had left them, ond, standing behind the rocks, had begun to turn in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind her...\nBut shameful to be held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, told them to progress, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, is ony thieves should hang over and take them back, they decided to rush in search of the enemy. Barely had they lost shelter from the rock, queri Lord Ruthven speeded up a blow of iri the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his help; and, no longer taking into account the greatest evil or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rutbven's wounded, immediately cast their arms and surrendered.\nBy promisos of oatmeal retribution, Aubrey soon brought the wounded frierid hjs to a neighbouring eabine; and after accepting a ransom, they were no longer troubled by their presence — they were content to keep the eritronce tll1 their comrade had to come back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of pain. He had been objects on him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his afsistence with more usual seriousness—\"Afsif me! You save me, you can do more than that, I do not interfere with my life, I am attentive to the date of my cxistence as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little, of my ebbs apace lily, I cannot deploy everything — 6vt if you were to hide all of you kriow ofmc, my honor was frec de spot in the mouth of the arid world if my death was unknown for some time in England—but life. \"—\"It will not be known. \"Jurez!\" cried the dying man, rising himself with exultary violence, \"Swo ar by all your soul resents, by all your nature fear, boasting that, for a year and a day, you will not lose your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being on the way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with thorial bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he poured out a laughing vpon bis pillow, arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many cjrcumstances attending his knowledge of this man r0s on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered hjs swore a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presentation of something horrifying agitation. Rising early in the mornirig, he was about to wrap up the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by him and comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took sevorcll of men, determined to go and bury jt on the place where he was. Bvt, when he had climbed to the top hc found no trace of eithcr the body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the identical rock on which tobey had laid the body. From far a lime his mind was scrambled in conjectures, but he returned to lclst, convinced that they had buried the body for the love of his clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to rise that superstili melancholic thclt had grasped on his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While he was waiting for a uessel to transmit it to Otranto, or lo Naplcs, he occupied it to organize the effects he had with hlm belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst the things otber there was cl casc containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. These were febrile daggers and ataghans. While turning lhem wer, and looking at their curious forms, whclt was his surprise to find irig a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get more evidence, he found the woapon, and his horror can be imagined when one discovers that he adapted, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in his h and. His eyes began not to need any other certainty — they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; however, he still wanted to disobey; but the farm porticu1ar, even the variousjng dyed on the haft and shcath were aike in the splendor on both, and left rio of the place for doubt; thero were also hlood sheets on eaeh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the gay way to Rome, his first investigations were on the lady whom he had tried to snatoh of the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their father was ruined, and she had not been bearded since the dowry of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became the almosl broken under so many horrors transplanted; he was afraid that this lady had falsified a victim at the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became rnoose and silent; and his only occupation oonisted by exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of a dear ho hardi oria. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swollen hlm on the English coasts; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to the lase, in the embraces and hearts of his sister, the memory of the past. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she gained the biscffection, laughing that the womani was beginning to approach, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won a graoe that won the gaze and applause of tbe drclwing-room assembled. Tbere was ridiculed by this slight shine wbich exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apart. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mjnd benealh. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some sentimentjng spirit, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter roalm. Except not was tbat foot light, which strays where to er a butterfly or color can attract—it was sedated and pensive. When alone, the face hors was never brilliantly brilliantly joyful; but when his brother blew him his defection, and forgot in his presence those deed that she knew how to destroy the rest bis, who would have excharigoted his smile for trot of the v0luptuaire? Looks like those eyes...\nThis face was a tuna playing in the light of their own native sphere. She has only eightcens yet, and has not been presented to the world, he having bcen swinter by his guards more in shape than his presentation should be delayed until his brother's return from the continent, when he could be his protector. It is therefore now resolved that the nexl lounge, which is approaching rapidly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the marisiori of his sators, and fed on him melancho1y who supplanted him. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolities of the fashionablo foreigners, when his miride had been so torn apart by the events that he had ritnossed; bvt he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to town, and prepared for the next day, which hcld boen announed as a living room.\nThe cro wd was excessive — a living room had not been held to be a long lime, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, rushed into it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While ho was standing in a comer alone, without anything around him, engaged in the thal memory the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place, he felt that he suddenly felt gripped by his arm, on a voice which he also recognized wel1, sounded in the car—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a blaslhim blaslhim spectator, whom he perceived, at a bit of distanee, the same figure who had stirred his opinion on this point until his first entry into society. He looked until his members were almost reluctant to wear lheir wejght, he was oliged t0 to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his clirriago, and was drlven home. He passed the ro0m with rushed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would be shrunk from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him-circumstances began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his oath.—He roused bimself, being could not believe that he could – died rife again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the imago his mind was based on. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore discouraged going back into the soeiety; for although he tried t0 afk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leggling her under the prolection of a matron, he plunged into a corner, and went to his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, in the last place, that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, found his sislersvrrrounded by several, apparent in a serious conuersation; he began to pass t0 and approached her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. And he went forth, and took the arm of his sisler, which was set in motion, on a hurry, and forced her to the street: and at the door he took himself the multitude of servants, who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to pass them, he heard again this voice whispering by him: \"Remember thy oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to him.\nAubrey has become almost distracted. So before his mind was absorbed by the onc subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the amateur's love has once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention has now gone unanswered, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what caused her sudden conduct. He spoke only a few words, arid those who terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath killed him, and then he allowed this annuitant to wander, to bearirig ruiri vp0n his breath, from amldstaHe was asleep, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his very sister touched him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his supplications, who would believe him? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but the diatb, he remembers, had been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister cclme, who, with eyes flowing with tears of spirit, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, for fear that bis housc, wanders from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted bim. His dress calmed down, and he wandered, as often exhaled in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was not Ionger to be recognized; at first he returned with the eternal to the houso; but at last he laid bim until rcsl where fatigue overhangs him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bjm; but they were soon distracted by him who was fleeing from a pvrsuer faster than any — from a chchett. His driving, h0wever, changed slightly. The idea that he left by his absence to all his friends, with a fiend of the omongs, whose presence they were unconscious, he dissuaded from entering society again, and from looking at him close, anxious in advance, despite the oath, all those whom Lord Rvthven approached with intimaey. But when he entered a roar, his hamburger and his suspicious lo0ks were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his fissier was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, rem0nstronoe turned out to be unauaiIjng, the Guordians thought it appropriate to invert, and, fearing that his mind became a1jenated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that was previously imposed by the porents of Aubrey.\nDesiring to blow him off from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what the madness conldcred, they instructed a doctor to reside in the house, and to listen to him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice it, if camplely was his mind absorbed by a torible subjecl. His incoherence became so great in Iclst that he was conspired in his chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaoic, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier; — the only sign of arid affection reminding himself of his sister's test; then, sometimes, would be beginning, arid, grasping his hands, wilh seems that gravely distressed hc, he wanted her not to tease him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he reproved, her only answer was: \"True! Truo!\" And again, he threw himself into a state, wherever she couldn't ruse bim. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was possessed, its inconsistencies scaffolded less, and his mind threw a porter of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several ljmes in the day he counted on hjsfingers a definitive nuinber, and the smile lhen.\nThe time had almost passed, when, backwards, the last day, if one of his guards entered his room, began to converse with his physicist on the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey'f being in such a horrible fituati0n, when his sister went the next day to be trapped. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he tried to find out who. GIad of this mark of return of the intellect, when they feared that he was depraved, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count he had with me, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by bis exfusing hls jntenlion to be present at nuptia1s, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the iriflvence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his chest, set on his cheek, tears wet, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once alive to feelings of affection. He started talking with all the hls wonted heat, and congratulated you on his up0n marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accomplishing; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his breasl; open it up, what was his surprise that the fcats of the monster wh0 had infused his life so long. He grabs the porltrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under the fool. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her, then shaking her hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression in his face, he told her to swear that she would never marry this moribund, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that if thal uolce again blazes him his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinksjngLord Ruthvon was near him, but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had bearded the whole, arid thought that this wcls bul o back from her disorder, cntered, and Miss Avbrey's sorcerer, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, and begged them to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to infallibility, imagined hcld taken possession of the spirit os hjs, tried to pacify him, and rctir.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning back room, and he had refused with all the others. Wben heard of Aubrey's evil, but he understood it well; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his arid exultation could hardly be concealed from those whom he had acquired this information. He rushed to the house of his former friend, arid, by constant alternance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and inrest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's car. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell — could speak of itself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded carth, except with the one to whom he addressed;— could he know how, if he knew her, her exislence, had 6eguri seemed worthy of preservation, if he was simply able to listen to his soothing accents;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or this was the wll of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the elder brclrich falilig in the end, he worked on an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state), which was to take place the same day, before his deportation for the oontinent.\nAubrey, who was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; they gave him bits; he wrote a lelter lo his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once buried her in their arms, hindered their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for a few hours, this marriage, on which the heaviest curses were denounced. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but, by giving it to his doctor, he thought it would be better to harass MissAubrey's ind even more by, what he considered, the rovings of a moniao. Nigbt passed without rest to the occupied inactive of the house; ond Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily concoive than described, the noles of the bvsy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiosity af the servants finally ovrcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the dizziness of an old woman powerless. He's selling the occasion, with a tied guy was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all were almost assailed. L0th Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him into the room, speechless with fury. Wheri on the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, that your sisler js has dishonored. Women are fragile!\" S0 said, he pushed him to his assistants, who, awakened by the old waman, had come looking for him. Avbrey could no longer withstand the hoists; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blo0d-vesfel, and he was transported to bed. She wasn't a lying sister t0 bis, who wasn't there when he came in, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The mooring was solemnizcd, and the bride and husband 1stft London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey iricreased; bloodshed induced symptoms of approaching teeth. Hc wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he told in a composite way what the roder had perpetuated, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guard hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when Ihey arrived, it was too late. Lard Rvlhven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTS 0F A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYR0N RESIDENCE ACCOUNT, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose a place of rebut, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN 1812, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, through the Greek Arohlpelago, we place in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and alwoys vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both the men of war and the merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrria, its bountjes arnply repay for the dailion of a voyage. We landed, like usval, at the bottom of the hay, and while the rnen was used in the watcring, and the bargcl-\nIn order to buy cattle with the rituals, the clergy and myse1f took a ramble at Homer's school scattered with caves, arid other places, shoro that we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound smclll so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the ifland four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage ovvr the hill, facing the river, bolongs to hlm, arid he hos left an old man in charge 0f it: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and resided tbere about four months, tb0ugh not constantIy; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThjf's account aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening to the home where our compatriot had residod. An old man kindly welcomed us and led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apclrtmenls on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious onexed closet. They only fell asleep: green walls, marble tohles on each side, a large myrtle in the centro, and a small fountain below, which could be played through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent possure; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall of Tbe stood a half-dozon In glish cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor individual painting. The bedroom had only one Iarge mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and one pillow – the corn bed to traversoul Greee. In the sitting part, we obsessed a recss of marble, once, the old husband told us, filled with books and papers, wbich were then in the trunk of a seaman l arge in the cl0set: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contrants. On the tab, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Bolleau and Rousseau are finished; the Rulns os Empires of Volney; Zimmcrman, in Thc Germari; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller os the Robbers; the Periodise Lost of Milton, an Italiani editjon, launched in Parma in 18I0; several small brochures of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah wos literally scratched everywhere, and marked with paper spirit sheets, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The Lord had the 6th reading of these 6ooks the union before he greeted, and forgot to wash them with the 0thers; but, he said, they must be there until his turn; for he is so partial, that if I move a thing without command, he would frown on me for a week together; he js otberways very good. I did him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm sor the lroublo to take care of him, with the exception of the zechins of twerity which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a dwelling house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for what reasori.\"\nThe appearance of the externa1 house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long over fourteen broads, and the marb1e pilIars flvted with black plinths and frel work cornice (as it is now cuftomary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the tobe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was robbed by a carpet of fir turkey, under an awning of strong caarse linen. Most roofs are furnished with tbuses, as on them the Greeks pass thoir ovcnings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", fruits of eating, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, as we were erecting the husc, a stream of 1 slide, grapes, orangos and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seal with an ornamonal back of wood was placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and laughs until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to his sons. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and he always attended our church twice a week, Sundays.\"\nThe point of view of this soot was what could be terrified \"bird-eye view.\" A line of rich vlneyards leads lhe eyc to Mount Calcla, covered with flowering a1ive and myrtle trees, and on the top bones that a Greek temple of anticierit enclaved iri majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon without shadow by a single cloud, ended the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, the smalI severol islands were distinctly observed, studding tbe light 6lue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a rnore view that I did; bul our questions were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had given in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could hang on, but I'm sure he won't, \"and you can go away, old friend?\" he said, \"if I scam,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armerian, but on our turn to the citywc learned the sevoral details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave to a man, horses, othors, and cotton and silk to the girls who live with these items. He also bought a new boot for a fisbermari he had lost himself in a scoundrel, and he often gave Greek Teftament to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from a1l we co-lected, to havc was a very eccentric and sensitive ohoracter. A circumstance that we have learned, wbich our old friend at cottage ght that is not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a strong piano, and had taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing wbo this ramblar in Greececoveld being. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and oll these eccentricities that inark peculjar geriius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fal1ing in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the Iarid island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mjtylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calclo's reclus in every page. Didn't we regret that we were not curious in our research at the cottage, hut we comforted ourself with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that mccly will never come back. I make this spread, for he is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice in the good name of his seigneury, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable dlsposition, averfe to associate with human nature, or contributing jn any way to so0th they soraws, or add to its pleasures. The fclct is directly reverence, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the most refined sentiments of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordshjp, soem lo have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that imprisons him far from a beige upon which Religlon sealed the artre, and the ovcr whose head Benevolere threw his coat. No man can read the foregoing pleasant \" traits\" without feeling praud of him as a countryman o. With respect for his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports are always received wjtb cauti0n, especially when the agairist has been unleashed the moral integrity of man; and the one who justifies himself before this horrible court where all the mvst appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest of the disadvantages of a vjrtuous heart and a self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Courl, Fleet Street.",
    "39": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy Jobn Wi1liam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which his tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it has not, however, extcnd jtseIf to the untiI Greeks after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the dlvjsion of Lcltin and the Greek cburches; at the time, the idea in vogue, tbat a Lalin body could not corrupulate so buried in their territory, it gradually jenetrated, and formed the subject of a lot of stor wonderfuI\nThere are dead people rising from their graves and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful people. Iri tho West, it spread, with a slight variation, in all Hvngary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres soaked in harm by some part of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strengtb, and lost feededly dled os con-\nIf the human blood suckers have become fattened, Jr's vows have dissipated to such a state of resupply, so that they have cohabited with the 6i to escape from all passages of their body, and to detach themselves from the pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, if a curjous, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is statcdto, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magislclets of the esplanade was carried out in a positive and unanimous manner, about five years earlier, that a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, was heard that, at Cclssovia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been torried by a vampire, but had found a way to rid him of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the Uampyra, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from being a hiinself vampyr; for, about twenty or lhirty days of death and burial of ter bis, many people complained of being tormented by bim, and a statement made waf, that people had been deprived of life by hif attacks. To avoid other ml of handkerchief, the inbebitants having consulted their Hadogni, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisin) fresh, and enlirely free of corruption, and emitirig in the mouth tbe, nose, arid ears, pure blo0d and floride. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the adversary's appeal. A stake was entirely pushed by Arnold Paul's heart and body, or it was said that he would have shouted terribly as if he had ambushed alive. It's done, they cut off the bis' head, burned his body, and threw the ashcs into his grave. The meosvros wero adopted with the corses of thase people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would, in turn, become agents on the othors who survive them.\nThe universal belief is, that a perfon pursued by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and sucks in its glow.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomonta is linked here, because it sees better fit to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In the Marian parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous erime committed wlfl in existence, that the decaf is born only condemned to vampyria, but the cornpeled to confront his infernal irritations only to those beings whom he loved inost while he on earth — those to whom he w nd by ties of kinship and affection. — A supposition alludes to in the Ie \"Gjaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre did, thy corsus en0m his tomb 6th rent; then ghaft1y haunt the place of origin, and shed the blood of all thy race; Tbero of thy daughter, slster, wifo, In the midst of the neighborhood drain the stream of ljfe; yet hate the banquet that must feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, have yet expired, shall know the devil for their sire; As ye cursed, ye cursed tbem, Tby bloometh, or wilteth upon the stem. But whoever for the weak crime must fall, the most Yovngest, 6 is loved 0f all, will bless You with the name of a father—This word will wrap Ly beort in flamo! Yet you must follow your task and mark the last tink of his cheek — the last spark of his eyc, and his last glassy look must see Who freezes 0' plus his lifeless blue; then, hclnd without Halloween will tear the braids of his island hair, including, in life, a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn—But now is supported by the memorial of the thiary agony! But with thy best blood shall flow; thy lobes of gnashirig, and thy lip of thug; thy stalker shall take thy sulten tomb, and Go-ond with Gouls, and Afrits rave, until these in horror shall depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also jntrodvc in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the young Arab Oneiza, who is repugnant as having retruct from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him that she loved better during her existence. But this is what one supposes to be lo which ended in the sin of the life of ber, and which was spread throughout the whole tale af a camplete type of purity and innocence. The veraci0us Tournefort gives a long story in trclvel bis of surprising several cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calinet, in hift great work on this subject, besides o variety of clecdotos, and tradilionary accounts illustrates his cffects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classical error, as well as barbari.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, neossay dedicated to the explanation, and wbich can now be concluded by simply pointing out, that tangb tbe term Vclmpyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with lt, makes use in different parts of the world: like Vroueolocha, Vardoulacba, Goul, BroucoIokcl, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared to various parties of the ton, more remarkable for his Sirigularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror of the arourid, as if he could not participate in Thereln. Apparently, Tbe Fair's light laughter only entered his attention0n, so that he could by a la0k choke him, and strengthen fear in the breasts where carelessness gnawed. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where he arose: some attrigued him to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, seemed to perish, set on a glean to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a lead reed weighing on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to too much dung; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the wedjgbt 0f boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging tbeir attentio n. In spite of the deadly tint of her face, whincb never gained a warmer tint, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong e m0tiori of passion, the form and outlino were beautiful, many female hunters after trying to be noticed, arid gain, at least some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who was lbe mocked by all the monsters in the drawing rooms since the hcr marriage, threw hersolf into her way, and did everything but put on the drcs of a montcbank, to attract her riot:—but in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were vnceived;—even her inappalled impudence was flouted, and she left the field. But common adultery could not influence the direction of his eyes, it was the riot that the female sex was indisferent to him; but this was the apparent prudence with which he addressed the virtuous wife and the incorrupt daughter, that few knew that he was ever speaking to breasts. However, he had the reputation of a winning t0ngue; and that it was that even he overcame the fear of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred af vice, he was like many among those femiles who boast of sex tbeir of their domestic virtues, as ainong the who wished him 6y thcir vices.\nA6 at the same time, a young gentleman by the name of Aubrey came to London: he was ari arphan left with an ordinary sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while bo was yot in the carnage. Left to himself by the Guclrdians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more imporant burden of his mind to the care of the simple suballerns, he cultivated his imagination more than his jvdgment. That's how he picks up this romantic high prize of honor and frankness, and he ruins every day so many fears of millions. He believed everything about tosympathy with virte...\nue, and thought that the vice was lhrown in by Providence only for the imagesqve efsect of the scene, aswo see inromances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply consisted in the vefting of clothes, which were also hot, but whjch were better suited to painting-\nThe eye of r by irregular lheir folds and patches of various colors. Hc thought, at the end of the day, that dreams were the realities of life. He is crazy, frank and rich; for these resonants, when he enters the gay circles, many mothers surround him, trying to endure with the least truth their languishing or snoring favourites: the donuts at the time of the sarne, by their frantic faces which he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of bif talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romclnce of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snob, there was no soundatlon in the real life for the ony of these congres of pleasant pjctures and descriptions controlled iri these volumes, of which he had formed bis sludy. Findlng, however, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up the hif dreams, when the extraordinary being we have ahove descrlbed, squatted him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hjmself, who gave few other strings of his observation of the exlerian objects, thcln the tacjt accord to their exislence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propnnsjty with extravagant ideas, he soon formed this objeet in the hcro of a romance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fantasy, rather than to assimilate it. He has known 6ecame bim bim, has paid attention to him, and so far raised his notioe, tbat his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, he realized that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were darkened, and that he soon discovered, on the street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of getting some irformation about this singular character, which, until now, had only wetted his curiosity, hehinted to his guardians, that it wos chime for him to pcrform the tour, which for many generations has been thought neeessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as so fill of tbe skios, which scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to tbe degrec of competence in corry lhem sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentionioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive a proposal from him to join her. Flattened by such a black bone of him, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he readily completed it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthvon, and now he has found, that, although many more Hls actors have opposed his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions fr0m the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; — the id le, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate need. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid pointing out, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indigencc by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of d0or with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his wclnts, bvt to allow hiin to harden himself in his lust, or to Sirik even deeper in iniquity hjs, he wos sent away with rich charity. Tbis was, however, attributed by him t0 the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the vjrtuous iridigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of her Lordship, which was more impressed on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a cvrfe on her, for they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and greatest misery. In Brussels and other cities that they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the appearance of whipping his companion to look for the centers of all the fashion vices; there he put himself in all the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played with ardour, except where the known shclrper was antagonistic of hjs, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was still the same unchangeable fao, wilh that he generally watched the society cling up: he was not, however, therefore wben ho met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a large family; then his law of much coveted fashion — this seemingly abstract mirid was apart, and hjs eyes sparked with more fire than that of the cal whllst wilh the half-dead mouse. In the towri, he left the old influent youth, torn from the adorned hc oar, cursed, in tho beevde of a dung, the bad tbat spell drew him to the reach of this fiend; that many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the word looks os mute hungry children, with at least one sarthing of his 1st immense wealth, where with even buying enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he took n0 money from the gobbling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, tbe lclst florin he had just pulled himself out of the conulsive apprehension of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, wbich was not, however, eapabIe 0s comboting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrcy often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this little pleasure which proved the ruin of hell, and did not profit his owl; — let him be delayed — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain contribution to speak frankly and openly at hjm; rainbow, this laugher happened. Lard Ruthveri in his car, and in the middle of tbe vari0us wi1d and rieh scenes af nature, was olways tho even: hissey speechless as his lip; arid thovgh Aubrey wos near the objoct of his curiosity, heo6 has not groater gra atificatlon of him that the canonical excitement of wanting vainly to break this inyster, which at his exa lity magination began to take on the appearance of something fupernoural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; he left him sitting daily on the morning of about a Countess of Ita1, while he went into the sorch of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was thus ingested, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonished bim; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, the woman seemed to give sufficient reason for the bim-\nef. His guards insisted that he leave his friend immeasurably, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers scdvctjon bones, made his moro licentious habits dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that if contempt for adultery had not given rise to hot jn of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to improve his gralification, that his victim, the associate of his vilt, be Hur1d from the pinnacle of vnsueed virtue, down from the abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom ho had sought, apparently because of virtue jr, had, from his dot, even thrown the mask, and had not rescued to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvbrey determined by leaving one, whose oharacter had not yet shined a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He breathed himself to invent an enslaved pretext to abandon him completely, in order, in the sense, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon percoived, tal his seigneury was striving to work on the experience of the daughter of the lady who the house he mainly frequented. Iri Italy, if rarely a married woman is inetwjth in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in fecret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and quickly discovered that an assignment had picked up, which would most likely end the ruin of an innocent girl, though not bought. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Rutbvenans answered, that his intentions were svch as he thought all would have on such an occasion; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry hcr, rit meroly ed. Aubrey retired; arid, impudently impeding a note, to say that from that moment he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to ruin other apartments, and by attacking the mother of the lady, he gave him all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. The signature was prevented. Lord Ruthven then doy simply sent his sergeant to notify his full assertion to a separator; bul did not suggest that he had no doubt about his plans having been thwarted by Aubrcy's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, he quickly found his elf in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the housc of a Greek; and soan took care of himself by tracing the erased records of ancient glorious monuments which apparently, as a result, became more and more fragile.\nampd to chronicle the acts of free men only before the s1aves, had hidden bcneath the sheltering ground or many coveted liohen. Undor the same razor as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could havc formed the model for a painter wanting povrtray on the carivass the promisod hope of the faithful in Mclhomet's Paradif, except that his eyes spoke a lot of sorany spirit one to think that it could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plclin, or stumbled along the movntajn's idea, one would have hove tho ga2elle a bad type of her beauties; for whom1d has exchanged his eye, the eye of the animated nature appeared, for this luxurious look slcepy os tbe animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe has often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and osten w0uid the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of cl Kashm are buttorfly, shaw all the beauty of his form, sloating as he was on the wjnd, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on an almosl effaced tablet, in the contomplation of his sylpha-like sigure. Hence the fall of her braids, while she wilted around her, the inhibition of the oxen in the ray of the sun, so delicately brilliantly brilliantly and faded from the hues, this might well excuse the forgct-\nfulries of antiquarian tbe, which let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance ta the true iriterpretation of a passage in the Pavsanias. But why try to describe the charm that everyone feels, but nonc can appreciate?—It was innocent, young, ond beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing roots and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his suture hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, jn tra cing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then descrire him the circular dance on the open plain, painted to him in all that shines c0lurf of y0uthsul mernory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having seen in her childhood; then, turning to bjcets who had obviously made a greater iinpression on his mind, threw to him all the supernatural tales of the nurse ber. And often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by pretending on the leprosy of a beautiful woman to prolocate her existence for the months that followed, her cold bload wouild, while he tried to laugh his oul of these idle and horriblc fantasies; but Iaritho quoted her the names oss old men,wha had finally detected one living among them, aster feeral of their relatives relativos and children had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fiend; and when sho mad nd hiin so incredulaus, fbe banged of him to believe it, for he had been, rernarked, that those who dared question their existence, had always had a proof, which forced them, with pain and beauty, to confess himself true. She gave bim details of the traditjonal appearance of these same monsters, and her horror is magnified, haunting a rather aocurate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in porsuring it, that there could be no truth in his fears, although at the same time he gained at the same time the many coincidences that had all tended to excite the belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to Ianthe; ber innocence, so contrasted in mind all the emotional virtues of the women among what he had sought for his vlsion of romance, wan his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young English hait man, marrying a daughter unducatcd Groek, he was even more and renouned alta-\nHe was attached to the fairy of the almosl. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for some resear of antiquclrian, he would make room, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found that it was impossible to steal his attentjon on the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept a lmage that seemed to be alone the possessor rjghtfvl of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always managed to separate from him with reductance; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy in the sketching or uncovoring somc fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. It had applied to ber parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present severcll, affirmed their existence, pale of horror to the narna itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to follow his excursions, which had to be the dctairi for a few hours; when they heard the narration of the plccce, they immediately led not to return at all times, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek wovld will ever remain, after the day has closed, to any confidancy. They described it as a variety of vampyres in their noctumal orgies, and they solved the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of the representations of these, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling al his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, whose narne even apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excursion without being coupled; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief in these horrible fools, had inspired them such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came next to his horse, and hastened him seriously to return, the night passed by allowed these beings to be pulsed in action;—he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he made a peroeive riot that day-lighl was about to end, and that in the horizori there is one of those spots that, in the warmer climates, so quickly gather in a trenendaus inass, and pour all rage over the devoted country.—He finally mounted his horde, however, determined lo mclke up by the speed for his delay: hut it was too late. The twilight, in the climates of the south of the island, is more than unknaw; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: He had advanced very far, the power of the storm was above – his shears had little rest interval – his heavy rain forced his way through the canopy fo1oge, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse scared, and he was carried with extreme speed into the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and it marked, by the glare of lightning, that ho was in the vicinity of a hovel which hardly rose vp fr0m tho masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust in the shelter of the basin storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for an inamont silerit, let him hear the horrific shrjeksos cl femme mirigling wilh tbe stifled, exulting mookery of cl laughter, conlinued in an almost intact sound;—ho wos stunned: but, awakened by the thunder wbich rolled again on his head, he, an effort suddenly, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in deep darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unaware of it; for, they call it, they ftll the contiriuated sovnds, and they gave him an opinion of n0. He found himself in contact with an ori, which he immediately grasped; a voice cried out: \"Agaïri floundered!\", to which he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt heralds afflicted by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he fought; but it was in vain: he was lift with his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on bin, and knelt in his chest, had put his hands kissed on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating tbroggh the hole that gavo ljht in the day, disturbed him; — rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the do0r, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he was breaking the timber, was no longer heard. The storm was not of size; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered, the slug of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on each straw individual wilhheavy foot flakes. In the desire of Aubrey, they sought her, the one who had drawn her to her cry; he was in the darkness; but what was her pride, when the light of tears burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a corso without life. He looked, hoping that there would be only one vjsion resulting from his disturbed imagination; but he saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by hls sjde. There was a color born on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as touching as the Iife who used to live there: — on the neck ber and the breclst was happy, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men punched, wept, simultaneously1 hit with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter box quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so many shiny and saris mink, now flanked by the flower of life that had djed him. He did not know what his purchases were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, clrid took refuge in ease — he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular conslruction, which had been found in the cabin. They soon met 6y different parts that hcld were engaged in searching for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as the city approached, announced the parents of some dreadsul catostrophs. \"To describe the mourning of their child would be impossible; but when they saw the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards lacorse. They were inconso...\nLab1e; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to the bed wcls sejzed witb a most violent and often delirious fender; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthveri and on Ianthe—by an unusable combinatiori he seemed to be begging an old companion to spare the being he loved. In Otbor Tyrnes, he permeates the evils on his head, and the cursed destroyer of ber. Lord Ruthveri, had the opportunity at that time to arrive at Athe ns, and, of the wbateuer motif, wearing the stclte of Aubrey, immediately put hese1f iri the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter began to pull off his delirium, he was horrified and astonished by the sight of the one who had an image that he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but LordRuthven, by his kirid words, involved almost the deafening repentance of the fault that had caused their separation, and still grieved by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with his presenco. His seigneury seems to have changed; it no longer appeared that the apathetio being wba had so surprised Aubrey; but as s0on his convalescence 6egan to be rclpid, he agaln groudally removed in the same state of mind, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, except that sometimes he wcls surprised to meet his fixed gazec iritcntly upan hlm, with cl smile of malicious oxultation playing at the top of his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted bit. During the last period of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in scrambling the progress of these orbs, turning, like the ovr world, the motion1ess sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was weakened by muoh, and this spirit elasticity which had once so djstinguished it now seemed to him to have fled forever. Today he was as lovers of solitude and silence as the Lord Ruthven; but as much as he desired,\ndc, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he was looking for him in the midst of the ruins ho had previously squandered, the shape of Ianthe st0od 6y his side — if he fought him in the wads, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned, bow, to his wjld iinagination, his face pae and his throat wounded, wilh a sweet smile on his Iips. He decided to steal scenos, whose excessive characteristic created bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had asked him to take care of the hive tenderly during his illness, that they should not attack those parts of Greece and that they had not yet had a quarrel. They went in all directions, and looked for all the places that were attached to a memory; but, although they had flouted fr0m room in place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of rohbers, 6utthcy gradually began to diminish these relationships, which imagined tbey were only the invention of individuals, wbose interest it was to arouse the generosity of thosc that they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result, they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as mentors than to defend. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilc, at the bottom of which was hed bone a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the precipices of the area, they hed reason lo repented their negligence; for hardly the whole part engaged in the pass of riarrow, when they were surprised by the whistling of clofe bullets at the head of thcjr, and by the ratio echoed from several cannons. In an iristanl, their guards had left them, and by placing the lhomsolves towards the rocks of Behjnd, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating the example, withdrew for an inescapable behind the saddle tower of the defilement: but shameful six-year-old thus held by the enemy, who with insulting shouts 6ade they advanced, and being exposed to the insistence slughter, if one of the thieves should rise above and tclke tbem at the back, they decided both to rush into the fearcb of the economy. Hardly had they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthuen gave a bullet back into his shoulder, which brought him to the earth. Aubrey was quick to attend; and, being no longer at his own peril, he was quickly surprised by the figures of the robbers around him, his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately thrown their arrns and surrerided.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon prompted them to transmit his friend your wounded cabin a nejghbouririg; and having accepted vpon a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are simply to keep the entrance until the comrclde should return to the spirit of the promised svm, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Rulhven grew rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like a c0nsjous of pain if he had been obieots out there; but towards the elove of the last evening, the bocam spirit apparently bad, and his eye often fixed on Auhrey, who was trained to help with more ordinary tban eamestness—\"Affect me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my lift, I'm paying attention to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you can miss my h0nour, your friond'f honovr. \"\"H0w? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I cried but little — my Iife ebbs apaee — I cannot explain everything — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and my death has been unknown for some time in England—I-bvt lift. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him. \"If with exulent violence, swear by all your soul, by all your nature, by fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes and my death to any living being on the way, whatever you may see. \"His eyes were inflamed with their sookets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sank on his pillow, and he did not breathe mor e.\nAubrey retired, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his mind,ond hc did not know wby; when one remembered his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, as if, from the presonliment of the thc, something horrible invaded him. In the morning he was about to enter the hover jn which he had left, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer thor, after having been oonveyed by himself arid cornades, at his retreat, at the pinaclc of a nearby mountain, according to a promise which they had given to his seigneury, that he would be exposed to the first oold ray of the moon which rose after his death. At the stonishod, and taking several of the men, determined to bury him to the place where he was. But when he went up to the sum, he had no trace of the corpse or clolhes, the thieves swore that they would poach on the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in conjectures, when he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the cl0thes.\nWeary of an oountry iri that he had met with such terrible evildoers, and in wbich all apparently conspired to the height of this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto or Nap1es, he occupied it to organize the effeels he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthv en. Among other things, there is a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. Whenl turning tbem, ond examining the curious forms, what was his surprise to sin a shcath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discavé in the fatal hut — he fuddered — hastening t0 gain surther proos, he sounds the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he mounted, especially shaped, tho gain that he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for a stealthy certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particulate form, the same different shades on the hast and sheath were all in the peeling on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eaoh.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady he had empty for Lord Ruthven seductelve arls' snatcb. Hor parents were iri distress, Iheir forturia ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lody might have a victim at Ianthe's destroyer. He bees morose and silent; and bis only the occupation can by exhorting the speod af the poftilions, as if he were going to save the lifo of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way on the Eriglattres coasts; and he clung to the tho-inans ion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the erbraces and the claws, in his sjster, all memory of the past. If before, through her insantine ears, she had gained her effect, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winning grace that wins in front of and applause from the salon's bonesemblies. There were none of these elements that exist in the heated atmosphere of an overcrowded aparlmcnt. His blue eye was illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about this wbich did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a little fresh1ing wjthin, which seemed to indicate to you a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't that light foot, which strays where to a butlorfly or a color mcly attract – it was sedative clnd pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, what exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, which Fao were then using in the highl of their home sphere owri. Shc was still only ghteen, and had had the 6th riot in presbytery to the world, he had been thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation if he delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his prolect0r. It was now, in fact, resolved that the next salon, which approached the most, should be the evocation of its entry into the \"busy window\". Auhrey wauld rathor moved into the house of the hjsfathers, and fed on the melancholy that defeated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolity of fashionable strangers, when his mjnd had become so tarn by the events he had seen; bul be determined to sok his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was in excess.\nive—a living room had not held for a long time, and all those who were anxious t0 bass in a kingly smile, hastened the titber. Aubrey was there with her sister. Whi1c standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he suddenly felt selezcd by his arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, saved in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a specter that would blaspheme him, when ho perceived, at a distance, the same figure who had attracted his notico on the spot tbis on bis first entry into the soeiety. He gagged until his members almost refused to endure their misfortune, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw bimsclf into his car, and was trained corc. He rushed into the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afra i d his thoughts burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances fainted in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oclth. — He woke up, hc could not make it possible — the dead were resurrected again! — He thought his imagination had only given him the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he decided to ask the conce rning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on the lips of hjs, and he could nat succeed in obtaining information. He later left with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Levjng under the protection of a matron, he retreated into a corner, and the gove babed himself to his own eaters. Perceivirig, finally, which many were leaving, he awakened from the suns, and entering another room, fovnd his sister encircled 6y Sovereign, in full o0nversation; he tried to pass and approach her, who one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took the bow of his sister, and with a whip he forced her toward the street; and at the door he snuck himself, preventing the multitude of the servants who were waiting for the Lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again the voice of thal murmuring near Bim—\"Remember your oath!\"—Hc did not turn, but, pressing with his fist, he reached the house.\nAubrey has become almost dissociated. Is before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, h0w much more completely was it rosy eng, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressod on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain what had caused her stubborn conduct. He only has a few words, and these terrified him. The more he laughed, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster lo roarn, bearing rvin over his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and did he not have his progress? His sisler could be touched by him. But even if he had to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe Bim? He thought of using jng his own hand to free the world from such a wretched o; 6th dead, he remembers, had already been burned. For days he remained in this state; shook in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his slster came, wbo, with his eyes being dumped, begged Him, for his good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stills and loneliness, he loft hls home, r ooded of stroet to the street, arixiouf to steal this lmage that haunted him. His robe bewitched the rioglects, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midday darnps. He was in rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening at home; but at last he helped him to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used stones to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly chclnged. Struggled by the idea that he left behind by his abscondence of all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society, and to watch him closely, anxious of forowarn, in a smear of oath of hls, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But if one entered a reed, that his discontented eyes and discontented eyes were so striking, that his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from sawing, for his own good, a society that touched HLM so strong1y. However, when the comprehension proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to instil, and when they laid down that his mjnd was alienated, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them previously by Aubrey's firewall.\nThat's right.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he had daily counted in his wanderings, locked up to prevent him from putting to the general eye those marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor to reside in Tbe's house, and tako constantly looked after him. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible suffering. His incoherence became so great that hot ho was limited to the bis room. He was often lying there for days, inconvenient with beirig rôd. He had become emaciated, his eyes had drawn a glassy lust;—the only sign of arid recollecion reappearing arid affection appeared on the entrance to his sister's place; then he started somolims, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that savourily afflcted him, he might have wished that she would not toucb him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love is far from me, don't come near him!\" However, when she asked whom he was speaking to, only the answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And again, he sinks into a state, from where she couldn't even wake him up. But gradually, as the year passed, his incoherenesis became less frequent, and his spirit threw a portjon of his morosity, while his guardians observed, thal several times in the day, he cum on his fingers bis a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the year, an af hclrdians entering his room, began to covet with his doctor vpon the circumstratory melancholy of Aubrey'f being in such a terrible siluation, that his sister would noxt day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked for anxiety to whom. Happy with his mark of return to the inte1lect, of which they felt that he had been deprived, they mentioned the dwarf of the Count of Mclrsden. Thinking that he was a young count who had been met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished even more by the expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't take it, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He swollen once again, able to capture the influence of his pretty smile, for he shook his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the end of his brother's life with affection. He started talking with all his wonned wclrmth, arid to c0ngratuler on his marriago wilh a pcrson so distinguished row f0r and each accomplished; when he suddenly perceived a lock on his chest; 0 Pening her, which was his surprise to the heissirig lhc characteristics of the wbo hod monster so long influenced his life. It sezcdthc portraits in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled under the feet. On her asking for wby he thus destroyed the resuscitation of her runaway husband, he looked at how he was being rioted to understand her—then grasping her hands, and looking on ber with a srantic expression of face, hc his sweatr lhat shc would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that this way would tell him to remember his oath—he suddenly televised, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the Guclrdians and physicists, who had heard all of it, and bought that it was a return of its diforder, entered, and waited for it from Mlss Aubrey, desired it to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged for them, but for a day. They, attributing tbif to madness lhey Irnagined had taken possession of his spirit, adeavred to pacify him, arid rot.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he easily understood it as a causo; but when he learned that he was crazy, his exultation and plcasure could hardly hide those among whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to go to the mouth of his former companion, and, by a tough attitude, and by the claim of a great caramel...\nHe's gradually gaining Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to rec...\ncould speak of himself of an individual having no sympathy with any being overcrowded with earth, sick with her to whom he addressed him;—could say to h0w, since he knew her, her existence, seemed vain to seem worthy of presemination, if it was simply that he could bind himself to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew that we knew how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he was spoiling his affections. The title of the branoh elder fell to him at length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's strange stclte), which was to take place on the day vcry before his department for the tho continiter.\nAubrey, when he was lefl hy the physiclan and his guardians, attempted the corruption of the servants, but in uain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sisler, the conjvrjng, as she appreciated her own happinefs, her own honor, on the honor 0f thossc now in the tomb, which once held her arms as their hope and the boop of their house, to delay bvt for a few hours this morrioge, on which he denounced the heaviest cursos. The servants would deliver it; bvt give it to the physicist, he thought it was a riot to kick to harass any moro the mjnd of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the greasing of a maniac. The night spent the rest of wjthout to the occupied prisoners of the house of Tbe; and Aubrey heard, with a horr0r that could easily be sprayed han described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning oam, and the lard of the pickles burst his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole awcly, leaving him in the custody of an old woman without shame. Hc scizcd the op0rtunity, if a bourid was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all weroonearly assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking arrogantly, rushed him out of the room, without a voice in fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee by day, that I have dishonored your sister. Women are fragile!\" So, he said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came unsure in search of him. Aubrey could no longer stand; hjs rage not finding the aeration, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was thrown into bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicist was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the sixth marriage and the husband left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; blood effvsjori produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's gvardians to be called, and when the hour of midnight hcld struck, he returned what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey, but when Thcy arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthveri had spoken, and Aubrey's sister had struggled for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, let him choose his place of rest, and Pr0proof his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board the arie of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we pvt in the horb0ur of Mitylene, in the island of lhat name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vcgetables still to have there, lead many Ritish B ships to visit it, warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the hips related to Smyrna, its premiums ampirepay for the deviation of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were wearing watering clothes, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with natiues, the clergy and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, which we had been before. On the front 0f Mount Ida (a small m0nticule so namcd) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio wlth ari the English lord, who left the Islamic days fov proviaus to our arrival in his felucca. \"He made me look like a pilat,\" said Tbe Greek, \"and he took me to look for him; but I did not choose to leave Mityleno, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six zechins grouped for her, (abovt L250 English currency,) arid resolved there about f0vrteen months, but not constancy; for he sails in his felucccl very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening at home where the Uvr countryman had given in. An old man, who led us over the mansion, welcomed us. It consisted of sour appartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a bathroom, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet attached. They were all simply decorated: green wooden walls, marble lables on the elther side, a large bluertle in the center, and cl small fontairi benealh, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the fvmiture. In the room stood a dazen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress extended or the floor, wilh two plush cotton quills arid a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, unfortunately, the old man told us, stuffed with books and papers, which were in the chest of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and R0usscau, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerman, in German, the Messiah of Klopstock, the noveIs of Katzehue, Schiller'f play of the Robbors, Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphiets of the Greek press in Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notos, written with a poncil, in Italian and Lalin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over, and marked with sheets of paper, which were also remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had read these bo0ks in the evening, he sailed, and fargot t0 place them with the others; but,\" he said, \"they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I move something without order, hc would frown me for a week together; h ls others very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the prefect of the farm if he has trouble taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small hill in the wood, ond wbom which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for which reclson.\"\nThe appearance of the outer nozzle was plentiful. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and bitter wide, and the flutcd marble pillars with black plinths and frel work cornices (as it is now usual in the Grecicln architecture), were considered ab1y higher roof of tcln tbe. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrode, was surrounded by a beautiful carpot of Turkoy, benealh an awning of coarse linen strong. The Mosl of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening twilight.\nOn the left, you enter the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shade of two bushes Iarge myrtlo, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we are told, the lord spent many of his evenings of arid nights up to twelve o'cl0ck, reding, writing, ond speaking to hese1f. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always frequented our chure twice a week, flouting on Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird's view.\" A flax of rich vineyards on the ycto Mont Calcla, in full bloom of olives and myrtle, and on the top of the whicb The Greek temple appeared in a majestic decay. A small current is found from the ruiris that descend into broken cclscades, until it is the last in the waods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea cls glass, and a horizon not eclipsed hy a single oloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a view of high hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations are not like the dwarf of the pcrson who had resided in this kingneant solitude: no one knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Candla. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could he tell me, \"but I'm sure he won't do it,\" and can't you say it, old friend?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I don't do it.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned the febrile peculiarity of the isolated lard. He had shared the eyes of young girls when he was last on the island, and euen daneed with them at tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articlcs. He bought a new boat for a fisherman who had Iosl his own in a storm, and ho often gave G reek Testaments to poor children. In short, he seemed to have been a very eccentric and 6fly from all that we have collected. A circumstance that we are looking at, which our old friend at collage thought he should not reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a piano-forlc, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination oll on the rack, guessing what0 tbis rambler in Greece could be. He was grieved, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of disposiliation, and there were all these ecclesiaries that marked a particular gorus. When we arrived at Palermo, our dovbts were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect, student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greoce, \"The individual, he said, aboul that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also saw him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the family of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from h0me; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hclnds we recognized the recluse af Calcla in the evcry page. Didn't we regret not having been curious moro in our research at the costlage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to the Mitylerie one day; but that day neuer retum. I make this statement, believing that it is not a disinteresting one, and that it is the good name of his seigneury, which has been seriously gloomy. It has been described as an ari insensitive provision, contrary to the assistant with the huinian nature, or c0ntriating in any way to appease his punishments, or add to his pleasures. The fact is djrectly the reverse, as can be clearly collected from these small anocdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of the seigneury, seem to have the seat iri his bosam. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his aotions; and his courteousness, the rest of solitude, is an additional reason to mark the hiin as a being on the heart wbose Religjon has put his seal, and on which hcad Benevolence has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymari. In resembling his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to givot an opinion. Caution must be exercised, especially when it comes to undermining the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible lribuna1 where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of another death. Lord Byron's character, if you want his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-taught consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "40": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstitlon on wbioh this tale is founded is very generol in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Chrlstianity; and it only ensured its present form since the division of the Latin churches and Grcek; at that time, the dominant bceome idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in the territory of thcir, it grcldually jncreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful ftories, still existing, 0f the dead rising from their graves, and nourishing on the blo0d of y0ung and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Avstria and Lorraine, where belief existed, the vampyres soaked a certain part of the blood of uictims thoir, the wbo emacillized, lost their strength, died quickly of consumption; while these hainan blood suckers were fattening — and their bccarne veins dissolve to such a slate of repletion, to cause the blood to flow fram all the passage of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the Jovmal of London, in March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible habit of a particular case of uampyrism, whatb is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. Itoppeors, that after a cxamination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates at the plaee, they affirmed positively and unanimously1y, that about five years earlier, an oertaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been a hero to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Scriva, hc had seen 6 tormented by a vampy, bvt had had a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampy, rubbing with bis blo0d. This precaution, howevcr, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for, twenty or ten days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tarred 6y, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent other handkerchiefs, the inhahitants consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in the ccls of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and throw themselves into the mouth, nose, and ears, pure florid blood clnd. The Havirig evidence was therefore oblairied, they resorted to the usual remedy. A ftake was trained entirely in thr0vgh the hcart and the body of Arnold Paul, where hc would have cried aut as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his hoax, burned his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corfes of those who had previously djed de vampyrisrn, for fear that they would pass away, in their cunning, on others who survived them.\nThe universal heliefis, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccomes a vampyre himself, and sucks at the turn of hjs.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade, if relayed here, becaufo, seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the current observations than any other instance that could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is a kind of punishment for death, for some heinous crirens coincided when it existed, that the deceased was not only condemned to vampyria, but that he had decided to limit his infernal visits only to those he loved most while he was dead, those to whom he was bound by bonds of indignation and affection.\nBut first anartb, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from the tomb of the Jts; and it shall haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of 1jfe; and Yel shall erod the banquet which performeth shall feed thy livid corsus, thy victims, yet Ere lbey shall expire, know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But one of them, for your crime, must be kindled, The young man, who is very attached to me, will flout you with the name of a foetus, and your heart will be kindled. But you must put an end to your task and mark the timidity of his cheek, the last spark of his cye, and the last glassy view that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the unhalifted hand will tear the braids of his low hair, including, in life, a lock when the tender offering of Affecti was only disturbing—But now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood of himself will flow; thy grinchy tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at thy sulten tomb, Go—and wilh Gouls and Afrits rave, until lhese in horror departs from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey also presented in his wild bul beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the varppyr corse of the young girl of Arclbiari Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting hjm that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to come from the sinfulness of life, being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tbe veracieuse Tournefort gives a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which hc claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a valety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrating the effects of itf, put forward some learned dissertatlons, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMariy curious and interesting noticos about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be omitted by merely pointing out, that if the torm Vampyre if one ln most genres I acceptati0n, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared in the parts of the leodores of the ton, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. Ho ga2d on the arourid mirror, cls if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the beautiful only attracted her attention, tal could be by a glance suffocating her, and throw fear into the breasts where thought reigned. Those who felt this scnsatjon of apprehension, could not explajn from where he rose: some attached him to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance pierce throvgh to the inner works of the heart; bul fel1 on the cheek with a radius of lead which weighed on the skiri he could not not not. His particularity made him be invited to every dung; everyone wanted to see hirn, arid thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of the nun, were happy to have something in the presence of some in a position to engage thcir attendiori. Despite the deadly hue of the face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of rnodity, or from the strong ossalon emotion, although its shape and line have worn beautiful, many hunters of feminism have tried to gain his attention, and to win, as a matter of fact, some marks of what they might call the affront: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every cannonier in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw hersels into her way, and made all the bvt put on a robe of a Montane bank, to attract her attention:—lhough in uain:—when she stood before the hive, although her eyes were apparently fixed0ri she, still it seemed that they were inporced;—even her uriappalled impudenco was bafflcd, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, there was such apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, who sewed knew that he was never speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and whctherlt wcls thclt itproven overoame fear of his singular charaeter, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like many among the women who form the b0ast of the sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who suily him by their vices.\nAt the same time, a young gentleman from Aubrey's riam came to Landon: he was a ban orp left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died that he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the Guclrdians, who tangentially tangentially to the tako care of his fortune, while they renounced the more importative charge of the spirit of hjs the attention of the inercenary subolterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judginent. He therefore had a sense of honor and high Romclntic thal frankness, which every day ruin so many apprentices. He all wanted to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was the object of Providence more for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we do in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply coniferous in the vestjng of clothes, which wero as hot, 6ut that were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, iri well, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and ricb: for these reosonfs, on his inheritance in gay circles, the dying mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the truth leasl their favourites languisbing or grumpy: the daughter at the time sarne, by their illuminating cauntenances when he objected, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him inlo falsc of the notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the rannance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in the tallow and the sparkling wax candles, born of the prcsence of a ghost, but of the lack of snoring, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptj0ris calined in these volumes, srom that he had formed his study. However, some compensation in his happy vanity, that is about t0 rclinquish his Droams, when the extraordinary being we have above describcd, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine all the things that he floated his propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather tban the person in front of him. He met with him, paid attention to him, and so far put forward his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. Gradually, he learned that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, and that he soon realized, according to the preparation notes in—Slreet, that he was low to travel. Desiring to spoil a little bit of informal about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that he was shooting f0r to make the tour, that for many generations has been thought riecessary to allow the young to lactate a few quick fleps iri the career of vice-lowards putting on quality with the elderly, and nol allowing lhem to appear as if fallen fram the heavens, scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: arid Aubrcy immediately evoking his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by sucb a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in ommon with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circlrig watcrs.\nSo far, Avbrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's choracter, and now he has found, that, tangb many rnore of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different consolusiori of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — idleness, vagaband, and beggar, received from his hand only enough to relieve immendiatical desires. But Aubrey could not avoid the marking, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the evildoers who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with repressed sneezes; 6ut when the profligate came to ask sorority, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his ergot, or to sink him even deeper into his iniqult, he was far from rich charity. However, he moved it to the importunity of the vicivs' importunity, which gcnerally prevailed over the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of bis Lordship, which was even more impressed up his mjnd: all the lhoose vpon that it was given, found unwaveringly that there was a curse up, for they all led either to the scasfold, 0r sunk down and most of the misery of clbiect. In Brvssels and other cities, through the spirit of the Faro table, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centers of all the fashionable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always won wjth success, except where the knowri was his antagonist, and then he lost even more tuna than he won; but it was always with celebrity without changing face, with which one generally looked the society around: it was not, commented, Thus, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or the unlucky fathcr of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of Forturia — this apparent abstraction of mjnd was set aside, and his eyes sparkled more fire than that of the cat while da lying with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, he raised the well-off and farmed young people, dormed by the circle which he adorned, cursirig, in the soljtude of a dvngeon, the fato which had drawn him to the reach of this fiendre; weeping a lot a father sat frantic, in the midst of the labs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their fervoury fervour. Yet he does not look like money from the gamb1ing table; but irnmedialely lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he just pulled out of the canuulsive take of the innocent: it could but be the result of a crtiiride of knowledge, which was rioting, however, able to fight the harassment of the most experienced. Avbrey Osten wanted to represent this to his Frisian, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own profit;—but he did—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity somo to speak to him frankly and openly; h0wever, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification from him than the moving excitement of vairily desireirig to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion for a while; he left him in the daily room on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of memorials in another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, the lctters arrived fram England, which he opened with implacable eoger; the first was his sister's, searching for nothing but fencing; the atbers were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he would sink before entering his thal imaginatjon there was a bad rosident power in the bis componion, they seemed to be lo gjve reoon sufficient for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his friend, and emerge, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irroslstiblo seduction powers, made his skilful licentious more dangerous for society. He had been distraught, that his c0ntempt for adultery had not come into being in the halea of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratificati0n, that his victim, the parlner of bis gu1t, filled with the pinriacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degration: in the sinc, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the aceton of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not rescued themselves to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose hcld character has not yet shown a luminous pear finger on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposig, in tbe rncon while, to look at it more closely, he strives not to let pass any slight circumcision 6y unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon pereeived, that hjs Lordship was working on the inexplicence of the lady's daughter he was dating home. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is inet wilh in society; so he was forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubrcy's eye followed him in his windings, and soon discovered that an assigration had been appolnt, which would probably end in the rulne of an innocent girl, though insensitive. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abrvptly asked him for his intentions with regard to the lody, informing bim at the same time that he was aware of his inclination to be on that night. Lord Ruthven replied: tal his internions were such that he assumed that everything was going to throw itself on such a recafion; and after being in a hurry if he wanted to marry him, he was content with laughing. Aubrey retired; and, tirelessly writing a note, t0 say, that srom this morning hc must docline accompany his Lordshlp in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant lo to seek other apartmerits, arid cclllirig on the motber of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena has been proved. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servarit to warn his camplet of a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion as to his plans of havirig was defiled by the interp0sition of Aubrey.\nHav ing 1ft Rome, Aubrey led his march towards Greece, crossing the Pcninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of himself by drawing the records faded of clincific glory on the monuments lhat apparently, afhomed 0f chronicellig tbe acts of freemen only before the slaves, had hidden them under the floor holtering or mclny colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a pagan.\nntcr wisbing to puvrlray on canvases the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for any ori to think that it might belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, 0n would have thought that the gazel1 was a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the animated nature eycof, for this luxurious look sleopy of the ariimaI adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, origated in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, fhow the beauty wholo of its form, floating cls it was on the wind, with a greedy look os blm, who forgot the letters hc had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the conlemnation of his figure of sylph. Often, trescs fall, while flattering arovnd, exhibiting iri the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, it is necessary to excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object that he evil before aspire to the vital imporrance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. Bvt why try to describe the wbich charms all the feelings, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, disused by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood there, and looked at the magical effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance on open peain tbe, painted, to him in the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered having seen in childhood; and then, turning to subjects which, obviously, had made a greater impression on his mind, bim bim all the surrituural ta1os of his laugh. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a pretty feole to prolong its existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh horde of this lide and horrific fantasies; but Ianthe quoted the names of old men, who had both detected one living among them, after their close relatives and their children had been found marked by the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she prayed to him to believe hor, for it had been noticed that lhoose had deaggered their existence, had always had a givcn proof, which forced them, with pain and heart,6 to infer. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of the Lhesian monsters, and her horror was inoroaved, hearing a fairly exact application from Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could not be the truth in her fears, although at the same time he w0ndered to the multitude coincidnccs whieb had all tended to excite a belljef in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey heganto is becoming more and more attached to Iarilhe; his inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the Amorig women that he had sought for his vision of love, w0n his hcart; set in motion as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still more and more he finds himself more and more attached to the almost magical form of him. He sometimes moved away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, determined not to return until his ohjecl waf reached cd; but he still found it impossible to fix his atlention upori lhe rvins around him, where in his mirid he retreated on the lhat image seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthc was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate herself from him with the reluctarice; but it was a blunder that she had n0 more than a spirit that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or vncovering a fragment that had still overshadowed the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with scveraI present, affirmed their existence, pale with horr0r to his very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when Thoy heard the name of the plac, all at once begged not to rot at night, for he necessarily did not support passing through a waod, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, at any confidence. They described it as the station of the vampyres in their night orgies, and unraveled the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their pclth. Aubrey made the light of their rcpresentations, and tried to protect them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal power, the very name af whicb apparently mado their frozen blood, he was sllenl.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on bjs unattended exoursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was converged versfjrid that his words, intimidating the belief of horrible fiends, had inspired TBem with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, and he allowed the power of these beings to be put into action;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive Ibat jour-Iight W0 could soon end, and that on the lrc horizon was one of those spots which, in the climates of war, so quickly gathered together a mass of tremendovs, and poured all the rage on the devoted country.—He, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed sar bis late: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced fclr, the power of the storm was soothed — his thunders failed had barely a reft interval — his thick rain bewitched through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning bewitched seemed to fall arid radlate at his feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was quickly transported through the entangled forest. Finally, by fatigue, he stopped, and found, by the brilliance of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof that rose up and ruffled the masses of dead lews and bruins that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide hjm to the city, or at the confident distance to get shelter from the storm layer. As he approached, the thunders, for a while, silted, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laughter, extending in an almost intact sound; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling agajn on his head, he, with a sudden effort, to open the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, put him in the shadow. He was apparently not perceived, for although he dared, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found himself in contact with someone, who is immediately seized; when a voice cried out: \"Again mocked!\" to whom a great laugh succeeds; and ho felt that he was afflicted by the one whose strength saw superhuman; determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force agallens the ground: — his eriemy pierced himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had placed his hands on his throat — when the glass of mclny torehes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, troubled him; — he instantly r0se, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the dorm, and in an inelement the erasing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now sti l1; and Aubrey, Incapable of moving, was soon heard by those with 0ut. They entered; their light 0f their t0rches fell up the mud walls, and the lhatch laadcd on each individual straw with heavy flakes from the foot. To Aubrey's desire, they laid down for her who had clinged to him by his cries; he was agaln left in the darkness; but who was his horror, that the light of the torches flashed once again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his just consummation scrambled in a walrus without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a still1ness on his face that saw almost as attached as the life that once lived there:—upori his neck and chest were blood, and on his tob were tho marks of teelh hating opened the vowel:—to what men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck the horror wilb, \"A vampire! A Varnpyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid alongside the ber wh0 which had recently been t0 bim the object of so many brilliant and sarcastic visions, now fallen with the fleur de liise tbat had died in it. He took refuge in the holiday, almost unconsciously holding in his hand a bare dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the cabin. Thcy was soon mellow by various folds that had boen engaged in the scarf of his wham a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to Corsica.\" They were unconscionable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey bejng put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; occasionally he called Lord Ruthven and Ianthe — by somc unaecountahle eombincltion he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. At another time, he permeated the evils on his top, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rvlhvcn, at the moment, stifled himself to arrjve in Athens, and, of any mobility, on the pillowririg of the state of Aubrey, immediately p1aced himself in the same house, and became constantly accompanying bls. When the lattcr recovered from his delirium, ho was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whom he now had the image of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for fault lbat had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon rebuilt him to his presbytery. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he did not appear as an apathetic being that had so appeased Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to accelerate, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, cxcept that sometimes he was surprised to meet his fixed gaze1y on him, with a smilo of malicious exultatism playing on his lips: he did not know why, but if the smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves of tidal loss raised by the cold breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like the ovr world, the svn movements;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the spirit that he had once so distinguished now seemed to have fled forever. He was not as fond of sollude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but although he had seized solitude, his mind could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he ploughed the ruins which he had once frequented, Ianthe's forin stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the uriderwood, in the quest for purple modefl; then suddenly tur-\nning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his pclle face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on the herlips. He has determined himself to sneaky scenes, all the characteristics that fuel such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender oare which he had taken from him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece nejther had seen again. Thoy traveled in all directions, the clnd looked for all places where a recollection could be attached; but thought they hadtened to place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to take over these roports, that they were only the invention of jndivviduals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of thase that lhey defended against alleged dangers. Because of this lack of opinion of the inhabitants, they traveled only with a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On the training, h0wever, a narrow defilement, at the bottling of which was lit lbe of a torrent, with great inasses of rock descended from the precipice nelghbouring, they had reason to repent more negligent; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in tbe narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and hy the ratio echoed with febrile cannons. In an instant, their guards left them, and, placing them behind rocks, they started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating the example, withdrew for a moment, entered into the bend sheltering from the desolation; but they struck to be thus held by a fae, who insulted themselves to push them forward, and being cxposed to the slave without resistance, if one of the thieves were to climb up and take them back, they decided both to rush against the word ln searcb of the enernia. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rvthven received a bot in tho shou1der, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers arovnd hjm — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was wounded, thrown his arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his friend bledod to a nearby hut; and bavirig accepted a ransom, he was no longer djsturbed by lejr presenco — they were simply happy to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ru Thven's strength quickly weakened; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objeccles about him; but, towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparent1y unease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was forced to offer his more ordinary wilh help \"Sit me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my first wife, I listened to the teeth of my life as literal as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the happiness of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but few things — my life fades — I can't explain everything — but if the yav hides everything you know, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world — and if my death was unknown some timo in England — I—but life. \"—\"He must be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him. \"If, with exulting violence, swear by all your soul, by all the Yaurian nature, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \"-His eyes seemed to burst from the bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubroy; he sank loughi Ng on his pillow, and didn't breathe.\nAubrey rested, but didn't slide; the many circumcised who were attending to his knowledge arose upon his spirit, and he didn't know wby; when he remorsed hifted oath o chilling cold came upon him, as if from the presentation something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer the thero, after having been transported by hjmse1f and comrades, to retreat bis, to the pinriao1e of a nearby mountain, in accordance with a promise they had given to his seigneury, he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon than rosc after his deatb. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot the prostitute lcly. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the sw0re thieves reported the idenlic rock on whieh tbey had laid the body. For some time his reindeer was puzzled in conjectures, but he returned to loss, convinced that they had buried Tbe corpsc for the good of Tbe clothes.\nWeary of a country inwbich he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this pilgrim melancholy which had seized the bis spirit, he rallied to leave it, quickly went to Smyrna. While waiting for a vessei to give him your Otrarito, or in Naples, he oocvpi in arrangjng the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alagans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an opparontly ornamented sheath in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — basting to obtain more evidence, is the w eapon, and his horror can be imagined when he disappoints that he was equivalent, although particularly shaped, the sheath hc held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: it seemed that he was bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to disbelieve; but the particulate form, the same different shades on the haft and sheath were also in splendor on both, and left rio root for doubt; tbere were drops of alfo blood on the axe.\nHe left Smyma, and one of his bome manners, in Rome, his first investigations concerned the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not known the bcen since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; to be Afrold thal thjs lady had been victimized by the destroyer of Ianthe. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, if he were saving the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to the will, soon bulwarked him on the English shores; and hastened upon the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of hjs sistcr, all memory of the past. If she were before, by her infariline caresses, hcld gained her affection, now that tho woman began to appear t0, she was still inoro attached as an accompaniment.\nMiss Aubrey didn't just win thanks to whlch goins the look and applaud 0f the salon assemblies. Thero waf none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a rolled apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. Therc was a melancholic charm on this subject which was not soem to be born of misfortune, but of a certain charge inside, which seemed to indicate a curious soul of a brighter kingdom. His sleep wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was sodad pensive arid. When cloned, her fao wos never shed light with the smile of joy; bvt when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence those sorrows that she kncw destroyed bis rest, who had excharigod her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, that face, were then played in the highl of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, ond had not been banned in the world, she had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he could be her protector. So it was now solved the noxt salon, wbich was the appraaching fclst, shovld being the time of its entry irito the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey preferred to rise in the house of his sathers, and he fed on the melancholy that prevented him. He could not tarnish the clb0ut interest the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the events he had put in mind; but hc decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in Lownn, and prepared for the next day, which had 6th announccd as a drawing-rooin.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all the wbo were anxiovs your bask in the smile of r0yalty, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was alone in a carner, he did not take into account the bottlenecks, remembering that the men he had seen were there, he felt seized by the arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear: \"Remember your oclth.\" He had the courage to turn, fearing a specter that would explode him, when he perceived, at a bit of discord, the same wbioh fjgure had drawn his attention to this place on his first onlry in society. He looked until his limbs almost refused their weight, hc wos forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with horrjed steps, and fixed groups on his head, as if he were afrclid his thoughts burst fr0m hjs brairi. Lord Ruthven once again took over him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead rise again! — He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind had rested. It was impossible for him to be rea 1 — so he decided to go back to society; for tough he oled to ask about Lord Ruthven, the namo hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in the gain information. He began to sew nights later with his sjster at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a nrcltron, he retired inlo for a break, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. He went away, and entered another room, and found his sister surrounded by several persons, apparently in a serious insurrection; and he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, who was asked to move, turned to him, and revealed to him these quarrels that he was screaming the most. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and rushed, and forced him into the street; and at the door he took himself of the crowd of searchers, who were waiting for their lords; and, while H.C. was in charge of striking them, he heard again the voice that drew near to him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey became alm0st distracted. If, before a sub-jeet absorbed his mirid, how much more cainplete1y was he engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again prevailed over his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she introduced her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He only had a few words, arid those who terrified him. The more he flew, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monsler to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and nat averted itspragress? Maybe he hit his squirrel. But even if he broke his oath, and described his suspicions, who would accuse him? He thought he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he would remember, hcld was already mocked. For days he remained in the state; he rose up in his remorse, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister Carne, who, with eyes bloody with tears, begged him, for his good, to break nature. In Lasl, unable to carry calm and loneliness, he left bis houso, wandering from street to streot, anxiovs to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandored, as often exposed to the rioon-day sun as the midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; first he returned with the evenerig to lhe housc; but finally he laid hjm to rest wherever faligue overtaken him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they soon distracted him who fled from a thari chase schutter any – en0m thought. His conduct, however, suddenly1y changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a fiende ainongst TBem, whose presence TBey was unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite the oath of hjs, all that Lord Rvthven approached with intimacy. Bul, when he entered a room, his gazes of haggard and suspjciovs were so strikirig, his inner chills so visible, that his sister began to beg him to seek, for her, a wisdom that affected so strongly Bim. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards felt fit to intervene, and, harassing themselves that his mind was alienated, they thought it high lime to take back thal trusl that had previously been imposed upon them by the pickers of Aubrey.\nDesirous of saving him from the wounds and sufferings which he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they confided in madness, they set up a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him by dismayers. He hardly seemed to notice it, if completely his mind is joined by a terribic subjeet. Hjs incoherrice finally became so great, that he was finished in his room. There, he often lied for days, unsatisfied by bei ng rused. He had become emaciated, the eyes of hjs had clothed a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and remcljning remcljning had defied his sister's writing; then he was going to begin at home, and, grasping his hands, with glances that severely deafened him, he wanted his riot lo touch him. \"Oh, touch him at the riot, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, shc asked whom he referred, his only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: graduated, howeuer, cls the year had passed, his incoherenes bccame loss frequent, and his mind threw a part of his glaom, which I saw his guordions, thal several linden day intbe, he counted on his fingers a certain number, and theri smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, at the end of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melclnchaly circumstance of the being of Aubrey in so awsuI a situatlori, where his sister was going to marry the next day. Instant Aubrey's attention was alticated; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with his return mark from the intellect, whose lhey feared that hc had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Marsden earl. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by hls expressing his intention to be ready to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer. His sister was with him. It was apparently again capatile to be affected by the influence of his Iovely smlle; for he pressed her into her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing on the other hand the thought of her brolher being more alive to tho féolings d'affeclion. He began to splash with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on his marriagc with a person so distinguished for his rank and all that relates to it; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; by opening it, what was his surprise that the characteristics of m0nster wbo had his long jnfluence of his life. He grabs the portrclit in a paroxysm of rage, and tramples it under the imbecile. After asking Hirn why he destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her, then shaking his hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expression bone figure, he told her to swear that she would have laughed at this monster, because he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that this voice had asked him to remember his oath again—he suddenly waved, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but did not see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and who thought it was only a retum of her disorder, sprained, arid of Miss Aubrey, asked her to leave him. He fell on their knees of bis, implored, begged them to delay but for one day. They were trying to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had broken into the living room in the morning, and had been refused with truth another. He heard of Avbrey's ill health, and ho readily understood himself to be the object of it; but when he apprehended him, he was judged mad, his arid exultation of pleasure could be defamed from those whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great affection for him to shine and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained the lock of Mlss Aubrey. Who could make him lose his power? His language had dangers and canvases that he was telling—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy for the existence of an ari on the overcrowded earth, if he had only to enumerate soothing accents;—could say how, since he knew, his existence, he felt worthy of preservation, if he could simply make soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or fuch wos the will of destiny, that he won his afflictions. To the title of the eIder brash falling long to him, he obtained a major ambush, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage tob, (in spite of the disturbed state of his 6rother,) which took place the very day before the departure bis for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his ardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pon and paper; it was him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuririg ber, as sbe appreciated his own bappiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who naw in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hape and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servans promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest the innate bvsy of the house; and Aubrey heard, in mind, a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the notes of preparation 6usy. The morning came, and the sound of the wagons crept on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Tbe's curiosity finally seized their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the vice of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with an affair was out of the room, at a time in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to persecute him: he immcdiateIy approachedcd, arid, taking his arm by force, rushed Hiin from the rubbish, voiceless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whistles his ear.\"Remember your oath, and know, except for my brilliance until today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his assistants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer supplant himself; his rage was not angry, had broken a blood vessel, and he was chained to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the husband Icft London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey iricreased; bloodshed produced symptoms of TB near clpproach of death. He wanted his sister's guards to be oa Illed, arid when midnight had struck, he would tell in a composite way what the reader persisted, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but that they arrived was too late. Lord Ruthven had already appeared, and the Sisler of Aubrey had slipped the hirst bone to VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF BYRON'S ORDER ON MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, were to chooso hif place of rest, and Providence his gravy.\"\nIN the year 1882, we sail through the Greek ln Archipelago, aboard one of His Majesty's ships, and put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of the name of the Lord. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to have there, induces many Britishesses Ta ijsit it — both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its bountjes pay a great deal for the devlatiori of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, men were used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and I were banging a ramble at the creek called Homer's School, and other places, what we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small monticulque so named) we met wjtb and hired a young Greek as our guide, who put us in bad shape Scio wltb a Lord Eng1, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his fclucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld haue took me with him; but I did not choose a quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, very good. The house on the hill, in front of the rjver, makes him long, and he left ari old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the wino-trader, six zechines hundrod for her, (ahout L250 English currency,) and resided there about fourteen monlhs, but not oonantly; for hc veils in his fclucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account greatly exacerbated our curiosity, and we did not waste time hastening from the h0vse where our peasant had resided. We were nice to have received 6y an old man, who was driving us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing walk, a sitting room and a bathroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They are all decorated in a simplifying way: green-coloured walls, marbled lables on both sides, a large myrtle in conlre lhe, and a fontoine below, which would be played through the branches by movirig a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Vonus in a bent postvro; a large hearing or sofa completes the furniture. In the room there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book vase: there were no mirr0rs, nor a single painting. The hcld bedroom only has a large matte mass spread over the floor, with two cotton teddy qvilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the meeting room, we observed a morble corner, once, the old man told us, faithful with books and papers, that we then have in the trunk of a largc sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think that our two bodies were justified in examining the conterts. The works of Voltaire, Shakspeclre, Boileau and Rovsseau are finished; Volney'fRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; the Messiah of Klapsloek; the novols of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schjller; the Paradise of Millon Lost, Italian Ari edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the small pamphlets of the Groek press in ConstantiriopIe, very torn, but no English book of all the disccriplion. Most of these books were filled with rnarginal notes, written with cl peneil, in Italion and Latin. The Messiah was first scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had been read...\nirigates these books till evening before he greeted, and forgot to place them with the othors; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I move a thing without order, it would frown upon me for a week togethcr; it is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of it, excepl twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small c0ttage in the wood, and which the lord brought Berc of Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty lorig steps and fourteen large, and the canned mclrble pjl1ars with hlack plinths and cargo-work work cornices (as it is now usual in the Greek architect,) was considered higher than the roof. The roof, overwhelmed by a light stone bolustrade, was covered with a thin turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus satisfied, as on them the Greeks pass their enigres in smoking, drinking light wines, svch as \"lachryma ehristi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the enigreous breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large husées of myrtlc, a marble on the back of wooden waf placod ornamental, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evcnings and nights until you read, read, scribed, and spoke to him. \"I beg,\" said the old man, \"praying\" because he was very fervent, \"and alwoys attended our times twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe uiew of this seat was of the whale can be called \"a view of 6ird-eye.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, co-vored with olive and bluertle treos in bloom, and on the summil whose ancient temple Grcek appeared in majestic deccly. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the inuntain. The sea smootb cls glass, and a horiz0n urishadod by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; spans a little ori the left, through a view of high chesnul ond palm-trces, several smclll islands were distinctly observed, spreading the wave of 6lue light with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a gruesome view that I did; but our enqvirles were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I don't know,\" he said, \"and can't you tell me, my old friend?\" he said, \"if I cari,\" he said, \"I wouldn't dare.\" We didn't have time to watch Armenicln, but on our return to the city, we learned severaI particulars of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island of Tbe, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gives a cow to a man, h0rses lo others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a wbo fisherman had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor cbildren. In short, it appeared to us, from the oll we touched, for being a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstanco that we laud, that our old frierid at home tangbt own nat to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, the lord was often seen walking on the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and taunted him bimself the use of it.\nThis was the inforrnatiori with which we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination all about the rclck, guessing who tbis rambling in Greece could be. Hc had the obvious monoism: he had the philarithropy of the arrangement, and alI these eccentricities that mark the particular genius. When we arrived at PaIormo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect tobe, a WYATT'S pvpil, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individualol,\" he said, \"about whom you are so anxious about, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hclnds we recognized the ccluse of Calcla iri every page. Deeply we did not regress not having been more curious in our reservists at the cottage, but we got confused with the idea of returning to Mitylene one day of suture; but to me that day will never retvrn. I make this statement, making it appear that it is not uninteresting, and in the iustice tohjs the name g0od of Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, a reluctance to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to satisfy its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these litlle onecdates. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their seat Iri her bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem gujde all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of Solitvde is a key reason to mark him as a being on which Rellgion sealed his heart, and on whose head Benovolcnce threw his coat. No inan can read the previous plisjng \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his love or plea, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships are always received with the clutiori, especially when they are directed against the moral irradiatedness of man; and the one who dares to justify himself wonders that the horrific trihunal where everything must appear, only can censor the errars of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is dreadful of his genius. T0 doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is safer testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approval consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Slreet.",
    "41": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Williclm Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very gencrale to the East. Ainong lhe Arabians it seems to be common: it did, however, oxtorid at the Greek tbe only after the establishment of Chrlstianity; and it has taken on its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which tlme, the idea of becoming predominant, that a Latin body could riot corrvpt so drunk on their territory, it has increased gradual, the object of many stories of wonder, still in progress, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the yovng and beautiful. In the west, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrajne, where the bolief existed, that the vampyres nightly soaked some of the blood of their vlctims, which were emerging, losl their slngth, and specdily died of consumption; while these suckers of human blood grazed, they clinged to such a state of replenishment, to cause the blood of all the passages of their 6odies to flow, and even to sow the pores even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular cclse of vampyrlsm, which is stclted in havo took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates, they stated positively and without joke that, abovt five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, set in motion Arnold Paul, had been heard scly, that, at Cassovicl, on the brothers of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land ovt from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre hesels; for, abovt twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complain of being tormented by him, on a statement was fashion, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants consulted tbeir Hadagni, taok vp the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and completely free of corrugation, instigating the mouth, nosc, and ears, pvre and flower blood. As the evidence was thus closed, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have cried as terribly as he was alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grau. The same measures were adopted with the corses of people who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents who survived them.\nThe universal belief js, that a person svcted by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstr0us rodomontade is relatcd, becaufe it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the current observotjons tban any other instance that could be adducod. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of purishmerite after death, for a heinous crime committed when it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to corrupt his infernal visits only to those who loved him most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection. — An assumption that has not been retained in the \"Giaour\".\nBut, as Vampyre sent him to the earth, your Corsica will be torn from his tomb; then he will haunt the native land, and he will suck the blo0d of all your race; from thence of your daughter will lick, woman, on the night of nridnight drain the stream of llfe; and yet loclth the bank that performs must feed your livid living corsus, your victims, still exhale, will know the devil for their sire; as you irrigate them, Your flowers will dry out on the stem. But a thal for your crime must fall, The youngest, the best loved of all, will bless You with the father na me—This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the 1clst spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the unhumiliated hand will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried—But now is home far from hy the Mcinorjal of your agony! But if thy best blood flow, thy gnashings unto the 0th, and the lip of the hook; Tben harassing thy tomb of sulten, Go, and wlth Gouls, and Afrits rave, till the women in the boundor depart from the spectre more secure than they.\nMr. Sovhey also introduced in wild hif bul beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting hlm she loved better whllst in existence. But this cannot be broke for having resulted from the sinful naves in her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the tale af a c oplete type 0f purity and innooence. The Ueracious Tournofort gives a long account in his travels of several clever cases of vampyrism, lo which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besjdes a variety of aneodoles, and traditional norrative illustrito of its effects, has put sarth some leorinated dissertations, tending to prove that it is an elastic error, as well as barbarous.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly borribIe superstition could be added; although the present can rely on the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the Vampyre lerm is tbe in most gcneral acceptances, there are several other synonyms with it, rnade use of in various parts of the world: from Vruc0locha, Vard0ulacha, Goul, Brueloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of the London winter, he appeared in the various parts of the leopards of the tori a noblemary, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could participate in the riot. Apparently, the light laughter af the fair only attracted his attention, so that he could by cl watch choking, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not explate from where he stood: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the obicct, seemed pcnetrate, arid at a glance to pierce through the inward work of the hour; 6ut fell on the cheek with a radius of lead weighed on the skln which he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence that could attract the attention of our attention. In the epile of the dead tint of her face, which never spoiled a warmer tint, either of the shade of modesty, or of the emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were heaulifvl, many women hunters after n0toriété tried to get her attentions, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call clsfection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of the euery m0nster shewri in the drawing rooms from her marrlclge, threw himself in his way, arid did everything but put on the dress of cl moritebank, to attract the attention bis:—but in vain:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, although it seemed like jf they were werc unporceived;—even her inanimate impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But the common adulllefs could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virluaus woman and the innocent girl, while few knew that he never addressed him to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongve; and if it was that he Even though he overcomes his singular character, or was touched by the apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among the women who boast of lhejr sox srom their domestic virlues, as among those who push him through their vicef.\nAt about the same time, he arrived at Loridon cl young gentleman 0f the name of Aubroy: he was an orphan left wilh on the only sister in possession of hail wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by the guards, who tangbt he dvty them simply to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the jmmportant charge of his mind to care for subaltcrns mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high romantic price of honor and frankness, which every day ruin so much millnerf' apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and yet, shot vico was trampled by Providence inerly for the effeot piece of the scene tbe, as we dries in the rannances: he thought that tbo misery af a cottage was limited to giving 0f elothes, which ch wre af hot, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in flne, that poets' drcams were the rakes of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circuses, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing favourites ar roinping: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating relations when he approached, and by the brilliant eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached to the rannance of his solery h0vrs, he was surprised to discover, that, except in the tallow and the wax candles shot flickered, not from the preserice of the mind, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of plcasing images and defriptions contained in these uolomas, from what he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation for his graceful vanity, he was aboul lo abandoning his dreams, when the oxtraordinary bjng we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at the hjm; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the charclcter of a man entirely absorbed in hese1f, who gave few other sig ns of his observation of extremal objects, that the tao sanctioned their existence, irritated by the avoidance of the c0ntact heir: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soari formed this 0biect in the hero o o romance, and dlerminé to observe the effusion of fantasy hif, rather than the person bcfor him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far advariated on his opinion, that his presence was always recogrified. Little by little, Lord Ruthven's business was embarrassed, and he quickly discovered, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was on the journey. From sirovs to get information respecting this singular character, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was time for him to tour, which he had been doing, Many generations thought it necessary to enablc the y0ung to take a few quick stops in the career as vice-tenders putting themselves on an equal footing with the elderly, and not allowing them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, acoordlng to the degree of competence carrying tbem. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking hif intentionioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to get him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who, apparently, had nothing to coinmori with the other mon, he accepted it gIadly, and jn a few days they had passed the wclters cirolling.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the baracter of Lard Ruthven, and n0w he found, that, about a lot more of his acions were exposed to his view, the results had made different enunciations of the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality; — be idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more tban enougb to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the thousand-sfortunes, even on life, that he was lowering his alms; - these were sent to sneeze the door with sneezes barely removed; hut when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his warriors, 6ut to allow him to water himself in his lust, or to sink him still in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him the greater import of the vicious, which usually takes him away from the retirement of the uirtuous needy. There was a circumstance around the charity of his Lordship, wbich was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, irietuously found that there was a curse on him, because thcy were all led to the scaffold, or funk to thc the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrey wos was surprised by the apparent impatience with which his flourishing endeavoured for the centres of all the sasbionable vices; there he entered into the spirit of the soro table: he bet, always clinged to success, except where the best known was the bif antagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but it was always with the same immutable face, with whooh, he generally looked at the socioty around: it was not, however, so much so that he met the young novice rosé, or the father without chance of a famjly numcros; then his very desire to see the law of fortune mod — this apparent abstraction of the spirit began, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the affluent youth avant-garde, tarry of the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness of a dung, the fate which had drawn him into the reaoh of this fiend; while many a fclther sat friantic, in the midst of the spanking resembles hungry children, with one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to falsify their present croupion. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gorilla he had just pulled from the convulsive transplant of the innocent: tbis mjghl but to be the result of a certain degree of knowledgegc, which was not, howover, capable of fighting the trick of the experiment. Aubrey often wanted to tell his friend again, and 6eg him to put on the face of this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and which did not have to do to his own prosit; — but hc delayed— for the day when he had bis friend would give bim an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; howeuer, it never happened. Lord Ruthven in his cartage, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and even though Aubroy was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification than the constant excitement of vainly desire to break this mystery, which your exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey, for a timo, lost sight of his componion; he left him in the waiting daiIy on the snoring circle of an Italian countess, while he went into the sorch of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters arrived en0m Eng1and, which he opened with impatience; the first was from his sitter, breathing n0thing but affeetion; the others were of his guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in a hif companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately leave his fried, and urgod, that the bis character was terribly viciaus, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his loyal habjts more dangerous to sooity. It had been discographed that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his chclracter; but that he had demanded, t0 strengthen his gratjfication, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, be cast out of the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of the abyss and degradation: in the end, that all the semals which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sjrigle luminous point on the whjcb to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext f0r abandoning him completely, purposing, in the meantime, to monitor him more closely, and not to let go of slight circumferences without mention. He entered into the same circle, and soori perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady who the house which he was mainly flogging. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to keep her plaris in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, arid quickly discovered that the ari assignment had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though thought girl. Not wasting time, he entered Lord Rutbven's apartment, and abruptly as he did his interitions with lhe 1ady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her this very laugh. Lord Ruthveri replied that his intentions were such that he believed that I would go to such an attack; and after having been in a hurry to know whether he intended to marry him, there was only one laugh. Aubrey retired;\nFrom that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the visit that he proposes, he orders his servant to seek other departures, addressing his mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his dclughtcr, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; but he did not indicate that a suspect would have been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to cross the rocks faded of ancjcnt glory on the monuments which seem-\n, shameful of telling the acts of free men only in front of slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or a lot of colo ured lichen. Under the same roof itself, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she migrated to form lhe madel for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of the paradise of the faithful iri Mabomet, except that her eyes spoke too much of spirit so that the Ari thought that it might belong to those who have no souls. As she danced on the plajri, or stumbled on the side of the mountain of Tbe, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of ber beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the bitter nature, for tbat drowsy luxurious look of the suitable annal but to the taste of the eplcury ari. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in her mother after antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kclshmere butterfly, would show all the beauty of the shape of the ber, floating as he was on the wind tho, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, his falling braids, as she fluttered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun tbe so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, he migbt Weli excuses the oblivion of the antiquarian, which left the telescope fr0m his very objcct mind lhe he had before bought vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why try to describe charms that everything feels, but none can appreciate?—He wos innocente, youth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating bal1s. While he was drawing remains of thososo from which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood up, and wcltch lhe magjc effects of his pricil, by tightening the scenes of his ncltive place; then she would describe to him the dance set up upori the open plain, wou1d painting, in bim in all the flamboyant colors of young memory, the wedding pump that she remembered vjewing in her early childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a impression of graft on her mind, would tell her the punctual stories of her nurse. His pride and his apparent belief in the whale were narrated, aroused the jnitrost even of Aubrey; and often, as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years amplifying his frlends, and the most dear ties, f0rced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful fairy1e to prolong his existence for the montbs erecting, his blood was running cold, while he tried to lo lavgh hor out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe attached to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after several of their children rar roulatives surd had found 6th marked with the stamp of the appetite of the fiend; upon him, when she found him so unbelievable, she begged to assimilate him, for he had pointed out that those had brawn to question their existence, always so proved, and to confess it to them. She stripped him of the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his terminal was iricreasod, hearing a rather precise descripal from Lord Ruthven; he, howevcr, still persuaded iri persuadlng ber, trot thcre euld be no truth in his fears, lh0ugh at the time he worderrc to the coincidnees mary who had all tended to excite a celib in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey hegan to cling more and more to Iarithe; innocence out, so contrasted with all the distressed virtues of these women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his horrendous; while he ridiculed tbe idecl of a young man of Englifh habilf, marrying or without instruction Greek girl, he was even more attached to the almost fetid form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he left, decided not to return until his obiect was reached; but he always found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins adorn him, while in his mind he kept on the image that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was harmless of his lovo, and he loved the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed to leave him with relucency; but it was 6c because fhe had no danger with which she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragmont that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had aspired to her parents on the subject of Vclmpyres, and both, with the scveral prosent, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which begged him for the detcliri for a few hours; when they heard the riam of the place, they all begged not to return at the same time at night, for he did not spend ceaselessly through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the day has been lost, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resorle of the vampyres in their night orgy, and denounced tho the heaviest evjls as imminent on the one who dared cr0sf their way. Aubrey made Iight of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but who he saw shudder to his audacity so as to mock a superior, infernal power, tho same name of whjch apparently mclde their bload freezc, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly on his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy facio of his hoft, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his harlot, and earnestly begged him to return, and the night passed by allowed the power of these eyebrows to be put in the aclion;—he promised. However, he was so busy in the research, that he did not perceive that the light-death would soon end, arid that on the horizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, so quickly picked up a huge mass, and poured all their rage over the devoted country.—He finally counted his horse, however, determined to catch up with speed for his delay: but it is too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night hegins: and the ore that he had advanced far, the storm's power was above — its thunders eoholng hcld barely a resting interval — its thick heclvy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue radig began to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, the horse scared, and they carried him with terrible rclpidity in the tangled forest. The animal with lclst, thrugb satigue, ignited, and found, by the glabre of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel lhat barely rose vp from the masses of dead Ieaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, hc approached, hoping to find one to spoil him in the city, or at least trusting in the shelter of Ohtoin from the stuffing of the stork m. As he sat down, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting with a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound;—he was surprised: but, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the open door of the cabin. He found himself in dark darkness: the sovnd, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, the sounds continued, we did not notice any hjm. He found himself in contact with someone whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out, \"Again mocked!\" to whom a great laugh succeeds; and ho felt harassed by him whose strength seemed so cold: dissuaded from selling his life as hard as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw huge forces against the ground: his enemy threw him by force, and his knee1 on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrated the hole that lit him in the day, troubled him; ho the moment he rose up, and by searching his prey, rushed through his back, and in an instant the crushing of the bronchi, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. Tbe storm was now stilI; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. And they came in, and the light of their torches fell upon the walls of the rund, and the thatch loaded upon every individual straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, to pierce the aerial form of his beautiful leader brought a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he stripped them, stifled by his sido. There was no colour on his cheek, n0t evon on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost bone attached as the reading that 0nce lived here: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth that had worked on the vcln: — that is how men pointed, wept, hit the horror simultaneously, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so much brilliant and magical vision, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He didn't understand what he said.\nHis thoughts were gnawing and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the holiday, he saw in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had money in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had committed themselves in fear of her that a mother had missed. As they approached the city, their 1 amcntable screams warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their mourning would be impossible; but that they checked the couse of their child's teeth, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the corse.\" They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed wos seized with a very vl olent fever, and was delusional; in these inlervalides he wovld ca1l on Lord Ruthven and on Ianlhe — by some inexplicable comhination, he seemed to beg of his companion to frmer the savings of being he 1oved. At other times, he would stop the inalegations on his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive at Athenf, and, of any m0tive, on the pillow of the state of Aubrey, placed himself immodiately in the same house, and became his accompanying eonator. Wben tho the latter recovered from his delirium, he was borrified and astonished at the sight of him whose indigence he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving a very great repentance for the sick which had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, onxie, and care which he showed, soon reconciled with his presenco. His seigneury seemed to change from quinquel; he no longer resembled an apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescere began to be quick, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but tbis smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to watching the tidal waves raised by the coo1ing breeze, or to marking the progress of tbose or 6s, clinging, like the aur warld, the sun without rnovation;—en-\nHe seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, ond tbat elifecity of the mind that once had its bim diftinguished now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as fond of solitvde and net as Lord Ruthven; 6ul as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athenf; is it sought ainidsl the ruiris which he had peasantly freckled, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the wo0ds, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, irisl of the modest violet; theri suddenly turned red, showed, to his wild imagination, his pale and injuring face, with a sweet smile vpon hcr lps. He decided to steal scenes, all the fetuses who created such bitter associations in his mind. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him bound by the tender cleavage that he had taken him during his illness, that they had to use these parts of Greecc nothcr again. Tobeytravel1 went to selfishness, and looked for every place where one could straighten out; but although they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard inuch os brigands, but they gradually began to digest these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interost was to stir up generosity towards those whom they were carrying out so-called dclngers. Because of this neglect of the council of the inhabitants, they once worked with only a few guards, more to serve as a guide than as a defense. Upon entering, Howeuer, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock descended from the neighboring prespices, he had Roclson to repent of their negligence; for he was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their heads, and by the echoed report of several cannons. In an insurrection, their guards were afraid to place themselves behind rocks, and they had started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the sbelterrig tower of the defilement: but eager to be so detached by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, cried out to them, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves were to go up above and lace them in the back, they immediately decided to rvsh forward in search of the enemy. Barely bad thoy lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to a grurid. Avbrey hastened to help him; the avil, which no longer takes account of the contest or of his own peril, is surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards flouting, on the wound of Lord Ruthven, immediately cast their ormes and handed over.\nBy promising a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; clinging to a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their prefence; they simply kept the intern until their comrade came back with the promiscundum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly collapsed; in Morlificatian twa days followed, and the struggle seemed to move forward with hasty steps. His eonducator and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had had the objects that surrounded him: but towards the end of the last enirig, his mind became apparently at ease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer a hif help with more seriousness than usual—\"Assist me! Perhaps you will save me, perhaps more than, I do not mean my life, I obey the death of my existence as little as the gift of passing; but you save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"\"H0w? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little, of my life eb6s apaee, I cannot explain everything — but if you hid everything you know from me, my hanour was the free defilement iri the mouth of the world — and if my diatb was unknown for a while in Erigland—I—6ul life. \"We know there's a riot. \"--\"Swear!\" used the dying man, rasirighim wlth exulting violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your natvre thrays, jurtbat, sor a year and a scly you will not communicate your knowledge of my crjmes or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or wbatever you can seo. \"-His eyes seemed moving to lheir socket: \"I swea r!\" said Aubrey; he laughed on the pillow of hjs, and breathed rio more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his aoquointance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold calmer came on the hive, as if a horrible os somelhirig pending bim. From the beginning of the snoring, be about to enter the hotel where he had left the corpse, when O Robber met him, and informed him that it was not a loriger there, having been transmitted by him-\nHe and his comrades, at his retirement, at the pirinacle of a neighbouring mooring, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, tal, he should be oxidized to the first cold rock of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and takirig several of the men, determined to go and cook him on the spot where he was. Bvt, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the eorpse 0r clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the identical rock on which they had 1ajd body. For his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the love of Tbe's clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such earthly misfortunes, and in which I apparently conspired to increase this pilenderslitic melancholy that hcld cries on his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting from a distance for a ship to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, to arrange for the effects of tbose that he had with him, being part of Lord Ruthuen. Amongst the things otber there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or 1ess adaptcd to ensure the deoth of the victim. There were several doggers arid ataghans. While the curious forms were being exarned, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently embedded in the same slyle as the dagger discovered iri the fatal hut — he shuddered — hastenirig to obtain the furthcr proof, he found the weapon, and the horror can be imagined that it was found to be the sheath that he held in his hand, although particularly shopped. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be related to the dagger; but still he cursed himself disbelief; hut tbe particular shape, the same varied shades on the hash and shoath were similar in the splondour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of bl0od on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Rome, his first investigation into the lady whom he had tried to striatch the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were iri distress, thelr forlone ruined, and she had not been bearded since the detachment of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken without so many repeated horrors; he was afraid to hit this lady hcld faIlen a victim to the destroyer of Iantbe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was difficult in exhorting the speed of the lhepostilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tumbled him to the Eng1ish sh0ros; and he hastened to the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and hearts of his sisler, all memory of the post. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her affection, naw that the waman began to appear, she was still rnore attacbing as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not won much thanks to whlch gaining the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There is none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been lit hythe levitated from the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not revolt to sow misfortune, bvt with a certain feeling inside, thal seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not this fo0ting light, which strclys where to er a butterfly or a color can attract—he was sedated ond pensive. When alone, the ecr face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother took his family into account loudly, and would be in the presence of forgetting those deed that she was able to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile so that the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played iri the light of Thelr owri's native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been brought to war, he had been thought by his guards more threaded than his presentation should be doubted until the return of his broth and the continent, that he could be his protector. It was therefore now resolved that the riext drawing-roorn, which was fast approachingiririg, would have been the epoch of its entry into the \"occupied soene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and he fed on the melancholic that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashionable strarigers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own c0mforl to the pratection of his sister. Tbey soon came to town, and prepared for the ncxt day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive, a drawing roam had riots held for an Iong time, and all those who were eager to rest in the king's tob smile, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood alone in a corrier, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the recollection that the most fateful time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in his place, he suddenly fell grasped by his arm, arid a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in the ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had the hard courage to turn, fearing to see a spectre would wave him, when he was poaching, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn his attention to his spol when he first entered the int0 society. He fought until his limbs almost refused to boar the weight of the boar, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and to force the passage through the crowd, ho fell into the hjs car, and was taken home. He hastened to stop the room, and fixed his haries on the heel, as if he feared that thoughts of bis would burst out of his brairi. Lord Ruthven once again seized him—circumstances began in a draconian painting—the dagger—his oath.—Ho woke up, he could not believe that it was possible—the dead are resurrected again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real—he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; for although the hc tried to ask to concerve Lord Ruthven, the name hanged on his lips, he failed to obtain the irformation. He left a few days later with his sister the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protecliori of a matron, he retreats into a corner, and the threshing gives her to his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many weroes were leaving, he awakened, and entered another room, found Hjs's sister overwrapped by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass arid to her, when the one, whom he asked for to move, turned around, and revealed to him these fealurs that he was most abhorrent. And he went forth, and slew his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, he forced her to the street; and at the door he was stung by the crowd, and the servants waited for them; and when he was engaged by the way, he heard again the voice of thal whispicr near him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He did not stop turning, but, pressing his sister, soon came to the house.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how muoh more completely was he absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attentists were now irrelevant, and jt was in vain that she treated her t0 to explain to her what had capped her sudden eonduce. Hc spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more he was suspicious. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, bringing ruin upon his glory, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent his progress? If very fister could have been hit hy hiin. But even if he were to blur his oath, and expose his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought of using his own hand to free the band from such a mess; but death, he remembers, had been mocked. For days he remained in the tbis ftate; shook in his room, hc saw no one, ond eaten only who his sister had come, who, with eyes flowing tears wjtb, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, n0 more able to carry calm and loneliness, to be left his house, wandered street from srom to street, anxious to steal the image that haunts the\nI put it on. His dress calmed down, and he wound up, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be relegated; at first ho returned with the oven to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever satigue overhanged him. His sister, anxious for his safety, stacked people for the foll0w; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any thought. His condvct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he lefl by his absence all the friends af hjs, with a fiond among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter the society again, and to watch him closely, anxi0us at first, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But if he would hold the irito o chambre, his distrustful and distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, at last flouted his sister who had to beg for him to refrain from seeking, his sake, a society that affected him so strongly. When, h0wever, rendranoe proved unshakeable, the guardians\nand, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they tangbl he hounded to regain the trust that had previously been imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to blow him off from the injury and the suffering he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prescribe him from the explosing to the general eye of the marks of what they oonside madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and constantly take care of hiin. He hardly seemed to notice jt, if completely was his spirit abs0rbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was entrusted to his carnber. There he is often lying for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, the eyes bis hcld reached a glassy chandelier; — the only breath of affection and remembrance remains irig showed himself at the entrance of his sister; then he would be somewhat slag, and, taking hold of his harries, with eyes that seriously afflict him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, come near to him!\" When, however, she enquired to whom he was reciting, her only answer was: \"Truth! True!\" And Ogaln shoved himself into a stew, from which even she did not push him. It lasted many months: gradually, bowing down, as the year passed, his incoherores became less fruitful, and his spirit threw a porliance of his glaoma, while his guardians observed, that the febrile times in the day he would punch on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had passed considerably, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan up0n the melancholy circumstance of Avbrey being in so horrible a situatian, when his sieve went the next day to get married. Instantly Avbrey's attention was drawn; ho asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of intellect, of which he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking of a young count whom he had met with the iri society, Aubrey seemed astonished, and astonished even more by his expression of the bis inlention to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his fist. Thyy did not reply, but sewing for a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently capable of agaln 0f bing affected by the insluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to the chest, and kissed hcr c beek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother once again living with feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his valet, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and all his accomplishments; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; to open it, wbat was his surprise to see the foals of the monster who had so long influenced his life. Ho s eizod the portrait in a paroxysm of rclge, ond very flogged under soot. On her asking why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if it were not uriderstand ber — then sejzing his hands, and looking at one with a Francoist expression of face, he told him to swear that sbe would never marry this monfter, so he—but he could not advance—it seemed that this voice made him remember his oath—he suddenly turned1y, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but was not sowing anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who struck this wcls but a return of his disorder, entered, ondf0rclng srom Miss Aubrey, wanted her to abandon him. He fell on his knees for them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing the infallibility that they imagined having seized his mind, were striving for pacjfy bim, arid in retirement.\nLord Ruthven had called the snoring after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he read himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be correlated with those among whom he had won this infermation. He hastened to the house of his old orid c0mpanion, with a constant assiduity, and the claim of great affection to scorch him and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? One could speak of himself as an individual who has no sympathy for any being on the crowded carcass, who loved with her whom he addressed;—who could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing embraces;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of lheserpent, or this was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title af the elder branch falling to him in the long term, he obtained an important embassy, whjch served for an excvse sor hasten the marriage, (in the spy bone the state deronged of his brotber,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the arid doctor his guards, tried to 6ribo the servants, but in vain. He asked her for paper and for perish; he was given to her; he gave her a lettercr, conjured her, as she appreciated her happiness, her honor, and the honor of fighting now in the grave, which once held her in arms as the hope and hope of their house, to undo but for a few hours this marriage, or that he escaped from the heaviest curses. The servants of Tbe promised that they would deliver him; but in giving this to the doctor, he thought it was a bet to no longer harass the spirit of Misf Aubrey by, what he considered, the confusion of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubroy heard, with a horror that one could more easily conceive thari described, the bvsy preparation notes. Mornlng camc, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up aum0st frantic. The curiosity of the servants of Tbe at last of their vigilance, they flew away gradually, the washing under the care of an old powerless woman. He took the inputvnjty, which was out of the room, and found himself at a time in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him, and immediately he received, and, taking his arm by force, he shouted from the chamber, without a voice with fury. On the stairs Lord Ruthven murmured his ear: \"Remember your oath, and if you are not married today, your sister is dishonored. Women are snoring!\" So he pushed him to his attractions, which, eaten up by the old woman, were not looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his rabies found no ventilation, and he broke a blood vessel, and lay down in bed. Thif was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, like the doctor wcls afraid to shake him. The marriage calmed down, the bride and husband left Landon.\nAubrey iricreased's weakness; bload outpouring produced symptoms of near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and when the midnight work had slruok, he released what the reader had read, he died.\nThe guard hastened to put Miss Avbrey in, but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTS 0F A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was al 1 enchanting him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nSeeing across the gruccan archipelago, on one of Her Majesty's huesels, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island1and by that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have there, lducates many British ships to visit—hoth meri of war and merchants; and although he is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums amply reimburse for the gap a voyage. We landed; as usual, the b0ttom of the bay of Tbe, arid whllst the men we use to water, and the shipowner trading for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical took me a ramble in the cave called Schoo l of Homer, and other places, where we had beeri besore. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so riam ed) we met and engulfed a young Greek af our guide, that0 told us that he had comb fram Scio with an Englshlord, that0 left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he took me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mityl ene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but a good man. Tho oottage on the hill, facirig the river, 6elongs to him, arid he left an old mcln in charge: he gave Dominick, the wine-trclder, slx cent zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) and resided here about fourcen montbs, th0ughnot constit1y; for he sails in his felueca very often to the diferentislands.\"\nThis occourit aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time rushing into the house where our compatriot had settled. We were kindly received by an old man, who smeared us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, a dry r0orn bed, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united grecn walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtlein the center, and a small fontajn below, which could be made to play through the branches by movirig a source fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed tho furniture. In the hall there were half a dozen English cane chairs, encumbered with an empty bo0k-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single paintjng. The bedroom had only one big...\nspread over the ground, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pil1ow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man told us, filled with hooks of arid papers, which were then in a large sailor's chest in the boot: it was open, but we did not think our1ves justified to examine the content. The works of Voltaire, Shokspeare'f, Boileau's and Rousseau are finished on the Tablet of Recreation; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmormcln, in the Gcrman language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the play of Schiller of the R0bbers; the Italian edition of Mi1ton Paradise Lost, printed in Parma in 1810; the small sevoral pamphlets sr0m the Greek press of Constantinople, very torn, have no description in English. Most of these books were wired1 with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian iri and Latin. The messiclh was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, 0n which were also remarks.\nThe old man exclaimed: \"The lord had asked to read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otbers; but, he said, they had to go until his return; for ho is so special, that if I moved a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week togethcr; otherwise is very good. I have done him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, the ox twenty zechin whom I pay to an old Armenlan who dwells in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\nThe appearance of the outer dung was to bend. The portico at the front was fifty long arid paoes fourteen wide, and the marble pillars lined with black plinths clnd work freight-work cornjces, (as it is now usual in the Grecicln arcbite,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone balvstrade, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen ftrong. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, the Greeks pass over them their eels in smokjng, drjnking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eat fruit, and enj0ying the evening breeze.\nOn the loft's hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with a back of weaden arnamental, ori we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings late in the nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to him. \"I guess,\" Sajd the old husband, \"prayirig\" to be was very popular, \"and always attended our burch twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe point of view of this seot was what could be locked \"a life of bird eyes.\" A line of rich vineyards led the yc lo Mont Calcla, covered with olive trees and myrt1e trees in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream is located from the ruins tho descended in hroken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a sin gle cloud, ends the view of the tbe will be; and a little on the left, through the af high avista chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely rejoice in a viow m0re that I did; but our requests were unanswered as to the nclme 0f the person who had resided in romantic s0litude: nonc knows his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenlon,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't,\" and don't you say it, old fried? Sajd I—\"If I'm ocln,\" said ho, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but a return to the city we learned several details 0f the isolatcd lord. He misshared eight young girls who He was the last one on the island, and he even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses t0 others, collnd coltan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also ruined a new boat for a flshermari who had raised his own in a gclle, and he often gave Greek Teslaments to poor chlldren. In short, it appeared to us, according to al1 we collected, to have been a very eecentrio and benev0lent character. A circumstance that we learned, whoh our old friend at the cottage thought he would not reveal. He had a beautiful mast daughter, with whom the lord wos often saw walking on the shore of the sea, and he bought him a piano-strong, and taught himself the use of this one.\nSueh faces the misfortune with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations first of all the rack, guessing who this rambler iri Greece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had philanthr0py disposition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect TBE, a student of WYATT'S, who had been on a trip to Egypt arid Groece, \"Individual TBe,\" he said, \"about wbom you are so anxious, is Lord Byr0n; I met him in my lives on the island of Tonedos, and I als0 visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been in sorne years fr0m house; cabin \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized Calcla's reoluse in every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious in the research at the cottage Tbe, but we conspired with the idea of returning to Milylene one day of runaway; but to me the tbal day will never come back. I take this statement, making it appear that it is not entirely uninteresting, and the injustice to Lordship's good reputation, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be abundantly collected from these small anecd0tes. All the finer feelings of the heart, his elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their soot in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional resonation to mark him as a bejng upon whose heart the Religion has put his seal, and upon which hcad Benevolence has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling ruddy about him as a covritryman. As far as his washing or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reprimands must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares himself, that is, a tribunal awsul that all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make the right secret, and avoid the applause of the world, is the safest tessalany of a virtuous hoax and approval of oonfcience felfs.\nTHE END\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Streot.",
    "42": "VAMPYRE;\nA tole.\nBy JohnWiliam Po1idori\nTHE FOPESTITION on which this t1c is stuffed is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks it after the establishment of Christianity; and it has on the Iy Assumod its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, idola becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in the territory lheir, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, until I existed, from the risjng dead of their tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a certain variety, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, Lorraine, where the oxist belief, that vclmpyres night soaked a certain part of the blood of their victims' TB, which became emaciated, lost their strengtb, aridly diod of consurntions; while tbese blood-suckers human fat—rides their dry veins to such a state of repletion, to cause the bl0od of all passages of the bodies of Ihera, and eueri of the very pores of Jr's skin.\nIn the London Jovrnal, in March 1732, is a credible account, and, of Courfe, a particular oasis of varpyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the coin and the magisterials of the square, they affirmed positively and without animosity, that about five years earlier, o certclin Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard saying, tbat, in Cassova, at the borders of the Turkish Servie, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to ridicule himself of evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from being himself a victim of a vampy; so, about twcn ty or thirty days after his death and burial, the people rnany complained of being t0rmented by him, and a statement was made, that four persori had been deprived of life by his bags. In order to prevent the overthermal rnisohief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cosmpyrisms) fresh, and completely free of corrption, and emitting to the mouth, nose, undisturbed ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was thus erased, they resolved to the usual rcmedy. A stake was completely pushed through the arid body of Arnold Pavl's heart, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been olive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and cast ashes into the grove. The same measures were adopted with tbe c0rses of thase porsons wbo had previously dictated vclmpyrism, 1cst should, in turn, become upward agenls of others who survived them.\nThe universal 6elief is, that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChicf bcliliff.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is related to the horone, as it appears to be better suited to the subject matter of these observations than any other instance that might be produced. In many parts of Greece, he is considered to be a kind of punitive death of the plague, for a heinous crime was committed while he was in existence, that he is not only condemned to vampyria, but that he was forced to co-infine his jnfornal visilations, so to tbose beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was put by ties of kinship and affection. — A supposition refers lo in tbe \"Giaour\".\nBut first, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his sepulchre; theri haunts the place of origin, and sucks the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, ef, at midnight drains the stream of lifo; yet hate the banquet that strikes thy living corsus, thy victims, are yet expired, and are the devil for their sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou crushest them, Your flowers are wilhered on the stein. But whoever for your crime must fall1, the youngest, the best 6elovod of all, will bless lhee with the name of a father—This word will wrap lby hear in the flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last bright look must see Whieh freezes his blue without ljfe; Tben in hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, De wbich, in life a lock when the pledge the son of affection has been carried — But now is supported awcly by temoria1 of your agony! And yet, if you have your best drop of blood, your grinchy toe, your blazed lip; Théri tracking your bloody grave, Go, and with Gou1s ond Afrits rave, until those in horror get away from Speclre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beclutisul poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyrc corse of the young Arablari Oneiza, who is reprimanded as having remurdered from the grave with the aim of tormenting him that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of his life, being poured out throughout history as a complete type of purity and arnocity. The Veracieux Toumesort gives a logical account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrjsm, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in bis great work on this subject, besides a variety of oncdotes, arid traditionalistic accounts illustrating its effects, hcls presented some dissertations Iearned, tendjng to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this arduous superstition could be a ded; although the preserit does not suffice for the limits 0f a nate, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyrc is lhe onc in mosl gcneral acceptati0n, there are several other syrionymovs with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, G0ul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nSomething happened in the middle of the dissipation.\nIn a London winter, the leaders of the ton appear to the various parties a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. ApparentIy, the scout of the fair drew only his attention, so that ho could by a jeook stifle him, and throw fear into the chests where the carelessness reigned. These wbos felt the tbis sound of fear, could not expiane from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eyec, which, by staring at the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, arid to the sound of piercing throvgh to the inner workings of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead which weighed on the skin jt could not possess. His peculiarities made HLM be invited to all houses; Oll wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to attract their attention. In the spitting of the mortal hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either fr0m the blush of rnodity, or the strong emotion of passion, although they were the farm and the contours are fabulous, many feminal hunters after notoriety tried to gain his attention, and to gain, at least, somc marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, wbo had been the bony mocker every monster worn in drawing-ro0ms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his attention:—although in vain:—while she stood up to him, although the hif eyes were apparently fixed on her, still it seemed cles if they were not seen;—even her inapplaudious impuderice was flouted, and she left the deficit. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidaric of the eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferently yours: however, this was the apparent cavtion with what he spoke to the uirtuous wifc and the inriocent davghter, tbot little knew that he never addressed women. He had, however, the recusation of a winning language; and if it was there that he overcame the rhyme of his singular charaeter, or that they moved by his apparent wreath of vice, he was also often among the Tbosque women who boasted of their sex of their domofistic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, he came to London a young gentleman of the noun of Aubrey: he fights with an orphan sister who lives in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still iri childhood. Left to himself, too, by guards, who had a grim duty to take care of his fortune, they renounced the inore importarit of the bis spirit to the cleavage of svbaltcrns mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, bonce, this romantic high feolirig of honor and frankness, which every day ruin the apprentices so moriy milliners. He believed that the vjce was launched by Provjdence only for the picturosque effect of the scene, as we saw in the romances: he thought that the misery of a house was a simple consistency in the making of clothes, which were like worms, but that the whlcb was better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and the various coloured stains. Hc thought, in the end, that the dreams of pocts were the realities of life. He was beautiful, sneaky and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay houses, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least trvth their languishing or blushing fav0urites: the naughty at the same time, hy their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, wben opened his lips, soori led him into false notions of his stories and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in tal1ow and the wax candles that flaked, not srom the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant picures and descriptions held in these volurns, from which he had formed his study. Finished, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, ho was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above went through him in his career.\nHe observed it; he had the impossibility vcry to form an idea of the oharacler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, which the sfender of the tacil to their exile, implemented by the avoidance of their oontclc: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object tbis as a hero tbe of a romance, and determined to abserve the offspring of his fclncy, ralher whom the person sat hiin. Ho met him, drew his attention, and until now odvanced on his opinion, he has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rulhven's affairs were embarrassed, and he soon found, from the nats of prayer in the street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of getting a little bit of information about this singular character, wbo, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards, tal it was shot for him to make the tour, whicb f0r Many generations have been bought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick sleps in the career of vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them lo appear as if fallen from the sky tob, when the scandalous iritrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of competence manifested in the pursuit of larn. Thcy c0nsented: and A ubrey immediately mentioning his thoughts to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found that, although much more of his actions had been exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conoIuslons of the apparent motivations to conduct bis. His companion was profuse in his liborality;—be idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from the hand of hjs plus lhan enovgh to relieve their immodious desires. But Avrey could not point out, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the unfortunates who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms; — these were the sneezes of the door with barely repressed sneezes; but when the profligate came to ask for something, nat to relieve his need, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to plunge him deeply into his iniqujty, he was sent away with rich charity. However, he attached by him to the largest unit of uicious tbe, whieh generally outweighed retired absenteeism towards the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstratory about the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed by her spirit: every lhose on whom he was best placed, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, for they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the west and the most abject misery. At Brvssels and in the otber cities through which they passed, Auhrey was svr taken to the apparent crowd with which his companion sought the cen tres of all the vices in fashion; there he entered into the irito the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always gclmblod successfully, except where the most clearly known was his antagonist, and then he lost even m0ro that he won; but it was always with the face of the immutable fame, with which he usually swept away the wisdom around: it was not, however, therefore, that he encountered the eruption young novice, or thc father without chance of a great family; theri his very desire seemed for a very good reason the law — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than lhat of the cat whipped with the half-de mouse. In every city, he left the formerly rich youth, torn from the circlo being adorned, ours, the solitude of a duneori, the fate that had Tirri hirn within the reach of this fiend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his last immense wealth, where lobuy even sufficient to satisfy the jr prefend. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gjlder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degreo of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Au6rey aften wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this punishment and pleasure which proved the rule of AlI, and did not tend to his own profit; — but he dilated it — for on the day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, it never worked. The Lord Ruthven in his corsage, and amalgamating the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey waf laughed at the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratificotion of him than the tough excitement of vainly desire to break Ihat myslery, who to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatural fomething.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his cainpanion; he left the hjm in daily presence until the morning circle of the Italian Countess, as he went in search of memorials of an almost deserted city. The first was of his sister, breathing nothing, the others were of his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had already entered into his imagination that there was evil power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediate departure from his friend, orid, exhorted him, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of lrresistiblc powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangarous lo society. It was found wrong, that bis connivence for adultery had not origirized in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinnocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy ond degradati on: in the end, that all the ferns he had sought, apparently on the doorstep of their virlue, had, since his departure, cast the mask itself, and had not burned to expose all the distortion of their victors to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had rioted yctmonstrated a single luminous pinl one that to rest the tbe eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for the complete abandonment of the bim, and to monitor it more closely and not to allow any slight circumstance to pass. He entered the same circle, arid quickly perceived, that his Lordship tried to work until the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Without wasting any time, he took away Lord Ruthuen's apartment, and suddenly asked two of her intentions with respite from the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of his beirig about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthvon woke up, that his intentions were such that ho so-called everything would have had on such an occasion; and at the time of being preferred if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew, and, no doubt wrote a note, to say, that from that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the taur proposed by Tbeir, he ordered a servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The attendance has been warned. Lord Ruthven the next day was content to attack his servant to warn his full ascent of a separation; but djd did not mention any suspension of his plans having been thwarted by Auhrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his slepf to Greee, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the faded archives of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, shameful of timing the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden ceaselessly under the sheltering self or many olorous lichen. Under the same roof clshimse1f, there existed a being, so beclutiful1 and delicate, that she could seize the model of a painter who wanted to spread on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that one could think that she could belong to the 0th whatat no souls. As shc danced on the plateau, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have brought the ga2elle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have expended his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the ariima1 adapted bul to the last of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often acc0mpanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, ond oflen w0uld the uriscient gjrl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttersly, show all the beauty of its form, floccating as it were upori wind, to lock it eye of him, who forgot thc milkcrs it comes from decypherod on an alrnost stunning tablet, iri the cortemplement of his figurc sylpha-like. Often her braids would fall, as she wilted around, exbibit in the ray of the sun so delicately brillianl ond swistly fading huos, itmibbt wel1 excuse the oblivion of the antjquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate?—He wasinnocenco, young, arid bcau ty, not afloated by crowded drawing roams and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, and swept away the magical effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described to him the circular dance on the open fold, painted, to him in all the brilliant colaurs of the youthful memory, the poinp of husband whom she remembered from viewjng in ber infancy; and then, turning to subjects who had obviously made an impression of graft on his mind, blew him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her fries, and her most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the lifo of a female l ovely to prolong her exislence for the ensuing monlhs, her holood ran cold, while he began to laugh at these idle and horrible fantasies; bvt Ianthe quoted to her the names of the old men, who had finally detected an amng living themselves, after severa1 af their close relatives and their children had been drunk with the buffer of the appetite of the fiend; and when shc found him so jnrcdulous, shc 6aggé af him Believe it, for it had been, pointed out, that those who had dared to question their existence had always had a given proof, which required them, wilh mourning and agitated heart, to confess that he was lure. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror spell became more pronounced, hearing a rather precise descriptor of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted in stinging it, tal could not be truth in his fears, tbougb at the same time wondered about the many coincidences that all tend to excite an elect in Lord Ruthven's superriatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, contradicted by al1 the offended virtues of women among wham, he had fought for the vision bis of romance, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idca of a man wig of English habits, marrying a Greek uneducated, rising still m0re and more clinging to the almost magical form before him. It would sometimes tear itself from it, and, forming a plon for the Antiquarian Care Resoarc, would be depclrt, determined not t0 return until his obiect wcls reached; but hc always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while iri his mind preserves on the image that only scemed the legitimate possession0r of his dolphins. Ianthe was unconscious 0f his lovo, arid has never been so frank incontile being that he had known the first time. Sbe always seemed to separate from him with reticence; hut it was because she no longer had a single wllh that she could follow her fauourite hauntments, while her guardian was occvpié in the skelchirig or discover s0me fragment whooh that had yet escaped from the hand destructjve of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of the Vclmpyres, and both, with several prosents, refined their existence, pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Auhrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which was to leave him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they rushed both to beg him not to come back at night, for he necessarily went through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after the day, on any consideration whatsoever. Tbey described it as the res0rt of the vampyr in their nocturnal orgies, and adenovced the heaviest oviIs as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path of the thcir. Auhrey made the light of their representations, ond tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when they saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, of which very riamo apparently made their freezc blood, he was silent.\nThe next day, Mornirig Aubrey celebrated on his excursion without lingering; Bo was surprised to obsess the salty melancholy of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the bcliff of these horrific...\nDevils had inspired them to terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly pleaded with him for retum, and night passed the power of these beings to be pvt in food;—he promised. He was, however, so busy in his referarch, that he did not see that the daylight was coming to an end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warrior climates, so quickly assembled in a huge mclss, lingered in pouring all their fury upon the devolved land.—He finally, bowed down, climbed horse-by-horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay; but he was at 0 late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is quite unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the storm's powor was abouous — his stranded thurders were afraid1y an interval of rcst — his heavy heavy rain forced his way into the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fly and radiate at his feet. Svddenly his horse got scared, and he wof carried with terrible speed to the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue,\npped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovcl that was not up from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that t0 would find one to guide him to your down, or at least trust any shelter from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the draconian shrieks, which mingled with the suffocated and exulting mackerel of a laughter, continued in an almost intact sound;—he was set in motion: but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his hoof, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. It sounds in total darkness: the sound, however, guided it. He was apparently vnperced; for, although he called, always the coritinoud sounds, and no remark of him was taken. He found bimsels in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a volce shouted, \"Again baffled!\" to whom a laughter of glimmer succeeded; and he felt overwhelmed by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: deceitful to sell his life as hard as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and yelled with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw 1f upon him, and knelt on his 6rest, had laid hands on his throat — when the glare of several torches penetrated through the h0le that was gravying in the day, disturbed him; — he rose up instantly, hung himself, leaving his prey, rushed to the door, and in an instant the crushing of the branches, cls ho broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The st0rm was now still1; and Aubrey, incapable of inovjng, was soori heard by those who were not. They attract themselves; the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw of heavy f1akef of soil. To the desire of Aubrey thycy scarleted for her who had attracted him by his cries; to be again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch was more bursl on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful oonducer brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, mocking that it was only a vision from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same f0rm, when he shut them, fainting by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even at the top of his lip; but there was a silence abovt his thal face seemed almost cls attachedjng as the life that once lived there: — on the ber neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein: — for the pointed men, ring, simultaneouslystruok with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly cultivated, ond Avbrey was laid beside her who, at the end of the year, was the object of so many visions of brigbt and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were — his mind was 6enumbé surd vuined lo shun reflection, and toke rofant on vacation — he almost unconsciously held in his band a nakcd dagger from a partlcular eonfstructjon, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for a molher hod inissed. Thcir lamentationablc weeping, as Thcy approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of the child would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's debauchery, they los oked to Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica.\" They are irreconsolable; both died in drunken state.\nAvbrey belng put to bed had a very vlotent fever, and was osten delusional; at regular intervals he called Lord Ruthven and the Iclnthe – by an unbelieving combinatjon he seemed to be begging his companion before saving the being he loved. At other times, he refrained from imposing mclledictions on his head, and from cursed him as destroyer hcr. Lord Ruthven, at random at the hour tbis lo arrive at Athera, and, for whatever reason, on the taking over of the state of Aubroy, immediately placed himself iri the same hovse, and became his c0n-\n- A police officer. When he retracted his delirivam, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him of whom he now had the image of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthveri, by his kind words, almost implored the repugnance for the fault that evil used their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it seemed only the apathetic being that had so surprised Avbrey; but soon he held his bcgan convalescence to be quick, he gradually removed jnto the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the old man, except the thal to the timcs, he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, with a strile of malignant exutation playing on the bis lips: he knew nat why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was appa...\nLooking at the waves without tide raised by the coo-\nLing breaks, or by marking tho pr0gress of these orbs, circle, like our worlid, the sun without movc;—in fact, he seemed to want to aroidate the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was very weak, and this elasticity of spiritwhjch had once so distinguished hiin naw seemed to have fled forever. Ho was now like muoh a lover of solitudo and silence like Lord Ruthven; but although he desired him for sollude, his mjnd could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he shook him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, Ianthe'f formed stood by his side — if he had seen him in the woods, his light step would seem to ask himself to amalgamate the underwood, seeking jn 0f the violet of the model; then suddenly to turn rombid, would show, to his wild imagination, pale hcr face surdwounded tbroat, wltb a sweet smile on his li ps. He decided to steal scenes, each of which has created such associations of mordus in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him bound by the tender care which he had washed of him during his illness, that they did not visit these parts of Greece or yet have seon. They traveled in the arduous djrection, and they searched for each place to whip a memory could be attenuated; but, although they thus haunted from one place to another, they seemed to be laughing at what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but gradually they hesitated to minimize these relationships, which they imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose plot was to incite the generosity of those they defended against the prolonged dangers. Because of this negligence on the part of the inhabitants, on one occasion they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides of cls than as a defense e. Upan enterng, Howcver, a narrow defilure, whose boltome was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of racks descended from the neighboring precipios, they had reasoried to repent of neglect; for they barely carried the whole part engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, and by the ec hoed report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left Ihem, and, standing behind rocks, had 6ogun to sire in the direction from which the game came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltering from the bottom: but shameful beirig bones thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, shouted advarice to them, and bejng exposed the slaughter without mercy, if one of the shouId cljmb thieves above and tako at the back, they immediately decided to rush in search of the eriemy. They had barely lost the Tbe shelter 0f rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder of thc, who brought bim to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asphyxiation; and, no longer spreading the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven'f 6eing wounded, immediately threw their arms and surferode.\nBy the promises of a great corner, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and agreeing on a rclrisom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their comrade shovld returned with the smoke promjsed, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthven quickly diminished; two days of martification followed, and death seemed to trigger wilh hos ty not. The conduct and appearance of Hjs had not chclnged; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that ho had been objects around him: but towards the end of the last evening, hls inind bocam apparently badly, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his donkey with more than the habit of pillowing—\"Assist me! You can save Mc—you can do more than that—I don't remember my life, I've listened to Rny's death as littoral as that of the past day; but you can save my good, the good of your frind. \"-\"How? What do you mean? \"I need a little opacity in my life, I can't explain all this, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free from the mouth of the world, and if my death was long unknown in England, I—but life. \"—\"It must not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the man dylng, rising up with exulting violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your fear, that for a year and a day you will not pass on your knowledge of my children to any living being, whatsoever it may be.\npen, or wbatever that you can see. \"- His eyes weaken from their bases: \"I swear!\" soud Aubrey, he lay on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but did not let go; the many circumstances attributed knowledge with thif rnan rose upon his mind, and he knew why nat; when one remembers his oats a co1d shiveririg came upon him, as if he stomped the present of the same horrible thing waiting for bim. Risjng at the beginning of the year, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by his sons and companions, at his retreat, to the top of the nearby mountain of cl, according to a promlse that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of fir of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey deafened herself, and took several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, the thieves warned, they reported the ideritical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, if the mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the c1oths.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all would seem to rise as the superslitic melancholy which had raised his mind, he decided to leave her, and soan arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to take him to Otranto, or Naples, he sailed to organize cafés he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, morc or 1ess adapted to ensure the mourning of victory. There were several daggers and ataghons. As he examined their forms of curiovs, which was his surprise to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon of Tbe, and his horror can be irnagled that he discovered that it was equivalent, although in the form of insight, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need of surmer, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to ignore; but the particular shape, tbe the varying shades on the haft and sheath were dared as in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Hame in Roine, the first jnquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to seductjve arts striatch of Lord Ruthvon. Her parents were in distress, the fortune was wasted, she had not been heard since the departure of her 10th ship. Aubrey's spirit became alinose 6roke without such repeated horrors; he was afraid that this Icldy had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He asked me to remain silent and remain silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the pos tiions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held. He came to Calais; a sheep, who seemed to obey his will, soon to be thrown away by Engliss; and he hastened to the abode of his fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the shams and caresses of his sister, a memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had no graoe winning lbat who won the goze and applauded the drawing-rooin sets. There was nothing like this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the benetb spirit. There was a melancholic charm ab0ut it that did not seem lo lo emerge from misfortune, bvt fr0m a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was n0t this light foot, whoh stra ys where to eat a butterfly ar a color can attract—it was sedate and pen five. When alone, her faee was never enlightened by the twinkle of joy; but when her brother breathed her effects, and would forget in her presence these shouts that she knew how to destroy her rest, who could have exchanged her smile for thal de lhe uoluary? It seemed that these eyes, — this face then played in the light of the native sphere of the air. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought by herguordianf more appropriate that her presentation should be delayed until the return of a brother from the continent, that he could be his protector. That's now, that's why, resolved that the next show, which was approaching, should be the time of its enlry irito the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to take over his father's house, and feed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could feel intimidated by the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been nourished by the events he had seen; bvt ho determined to sacrifice his own consolation in order to protectjon from his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-roin.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to rest in the kingship's smile, rushed over him. Aubrey was there with her sister. When he was standing in a room by himself, without taking into account all that made him feel, committed to the memory that the first tjme he had seen Lord Ruthven was in the same place—he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a uoice he recognized loo well, smiled in the ear bis—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn a spectre that would explore him, when he perceived, from a distance, the same figure that attracted his nolice to this place at the first entrance of bis into society. He looked until his limbs fled almost to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to leave a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven bome. He trampled the lho room with buried steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid of his thoughts exploding from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—cercvmstances started in a terrible painting—thc dagger—his oath.—He woke up, he might riot that it was possible—the dead are resurrected again!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his ips, and he failed to get the information. He married a few times afterwards with his sister at the assembly1y of a close relationship. After leaving Hor under the protoction of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself to his own vovring teagbts. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he awakened, and entered another room, quadrified his sls ter surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, imagined to him these traits that he most abhorred. Hc went forth, shook his sister's arm, and, in haste, bowed down to the street; at the door he found himself hindered by the cr0wd of servants who were waiting for the lords of Tbcir; and while he was committed to passing them, he still barbuted that voice which murmured by him: \"Remember your oath!\"\"He dared not turri, but, pressing his sister, sowed at home.\nAubrey became the dislocated alinost. So if he had been absorbed by a subject, jt was much more completely absorbed, now that tbe certainty of monster livirig agairi on his thoughts. Her slster's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged him to explain to him what had caused her unruly conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who tortured her. The more he thought, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised him; — was it then to bring down this monster to blush, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. Bvl kiln if it is a matter of breaking his oath, ond djs closes his suspicions, who will believe him?He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such misfortune; but death, he remembered, had already been moked. F0r days he remained in this state; locked in hls roarn, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, took him, for her, to support nature. At 1st, rio longer capab1e of calm of wild boar and sovilude, he left his house, wandered street curly to troet, anxious to steal this haunted wbiob image. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; he first returned with him at night to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where satigue invaded him. His sister, anxious for the hif sasety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disconcerted by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly harassed himself. Struggled by the idea that he left all his frieds by hif absenoe, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were not conscjous, he decided to enter the society in clgain, and to look at him as a closole, anxious of prewarn, in spjte of his oath, that L0rd Rulhven approached with privacy. Bul entered a room, his suffocating and suffocating eyes shook, his inword shuddered so visible, that his sister finally began to beg for her sakc to look for a society that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guardian had the right to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they took the time to regain that trust that had been taken over by Aubrey's parents before.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering he had encountered daily in his wclnderings, desiring to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, thoy hired a doctor to reside iri the house, and took constant care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great that he was able to go to his room. There, he would lie for days, unable to be awake. He had 6ocoma, his eyes had stirred up a glass chandelier;—there was only a sign of affection and memory that had manifested itself at the entrance of his sister; then he was going to start something, and, grabbing his hands, with lo0ks thclt devouredly distressed, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, do your love love love me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he referred, if only the answer was: \"True! lru!\" And once again it sank into the cl state, from where n0t even fho could wake him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was pasfing, its inconsistencies became less frequent, arid his mind to gratify with a p0rlion of his morosity, while his guclrdiens observed, lhat several times in the day to be counted on his fingers an infinite numbness, then smile.\nTbe's time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards tortorjng his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, which his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately troubled; he asked whom anxiovsly ta. Happy with this returnable intellect brand, which they feared had been deprived of, they deserved the name of Tbe Earl de Marsden. Thinking of this young count whom he had met in society, Aubrcy seemed happy, and astonished even more by his cxpressing intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but his sister was with him in a few words. He was apparently again able to be affected by the insluence of the beautiful smilc hor; for he pressed her to the chest of hjf, and kissed his cheek, saddle with tears, flowing clt tho thought of his brother boing once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all the hif wonted heat, and to congratulate her on her marrjage with a Persian so distinguished for rank and each accomplished; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on his chest; open it, wbat waf bis surprise to behoIdingles characteristics of the man who had influenced his life so long. It grabs tbe p0trtrait in a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under the feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed lhc reseinblance os her futvre husband, he looked as if he did not understand her — sojzing her hands, and looking upon her a frantic expressjon of c0untenance, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monfter, because he—but he could not advanco—it seemed that this voice still made her remember her almond—he said southerly rovnd, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the average the guards and physicists, who had kept the whale, arid took it away, was only a return of his trouble, entered, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, disdained him to leave the hive. He fell on his knees from bis to thom, he implored, he hounded them within 0 but one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had takcn possessian of his inind, endeauoured to pacify him, and rctired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the salon, and had been refused with all the ories. Whcn hc heard about Aubrey's health, being easily understood hjmfelf to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultati0n and pleasure could hardly be correlated with lhose among which he had obtained this information. He hastened to welcome his predecessor, and, through assistance, and the claim of great affection for his brother and to enter his destiny iri, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Could Wba resist his power? His language had dangers and tolls to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having a rio sympathy with any being on the soothing earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself;—could say how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to appear w0rthy of preservation, if it was merceously that hc could listen to your soothing ber would come;—in the end, he knew us how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will to fot, that he won his affective. The title of the elder branch which fell to him in Lenglh, he obtained an importont embassy, which served as a cxcuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and pclper; it was gjven hlm; he wr0te o letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, his own honor, and to be honorable of the grave now, who held him in their arms as their hope arid the hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours our marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest m0 curses. The servanles promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he bought better riot t0 harassing even more Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, greasing a maniac. The night passed without rest to the bully inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be concocted than described, well-filled preparation notes. The morning came, and the sovnd of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiously, if the servclnts lost their vigilance, they gradually took him away, leaving him in the custody of an old Helloss woman. He seized the opportunity, and one of them was out of the room, arid in a rnoment found himself in the almost assembled apartm ent whero. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, cast him out of the rose, without a voice, with fury. Wben on the stairwell, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear—\"Remember your oath, I know, if it is not the day of my bride, your sister is dishonored. Woinen are fresh!\" So he pushed him to his companions, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek os hjm. Aubrey could support himself longer; his rabies finding no ventilation, had br0kena 6lood-vessel, and it was passed to bed. This was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the doctor was awful to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the Bridc and the husband left London.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms 0f when approaching death. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and if the hour of the night had struck, he would take back what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubroy; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven hcld disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"Tho world was in front of him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the archipelago of Grecjan, in the archipelago of Her Majesty, in the year 1812, we put inlo the port of MityIene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of shells and vegetables still t0 there, lead many Britifh ships to visit it, both men of war and mercbants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its amp1y repoy bonuses for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men were used to water, and the bclrgainirig handbag for cattle with the natives, the clergy and I took a ramble at the c alled cave Homer's Sch0ol, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mourit Ida (a small m0nticule so named) we met wilh and cngage a young Greek as 0ur guide, who told us that he was coming badly Sci0 with an English l0rd, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I rioted to choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He has a strange man, a very good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left ari old man in charge of him: he gaues Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 Curreney English,) and has resided there about fourteen months, thovgh not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islarids.\"\nThis story greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time enjoying the house where aur countryman lived. We were kindly received by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bed-ro0m, with a spaced closet attached. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marblo tables on the eitber side, a large bluertle in the centre of the tub, and a fountain of smaIl below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of the tbe of a small Bronze Venus in a posture of readyjng; a large sofa or sofa completed the fvmjture. There were half a dozen Eriglish eane chairs in the room, and a full-filled casc book: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, using two stuffed c0tton duvets and a pillow — the cammon bod fraghout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large sailor's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not justify examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schil1er of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an itcllian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the little pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinoplo, much naked, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribed everywhere, and marked gulfs of poper spirit, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said, \"The lord had been sewing these b0oks the tangle besor which he has said, and forgot to place them with tbo the others; but,\" he said, \"they must lie his rcturn there; for it is so porticular, that if I move a thirig without order, it would frown me for a week to go further; it is moreover good. I did him a service, and I made the product of this farm far from the difficulty of dealing with it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenianri who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought here srom Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps lorig and fourteen broad, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and c0rnices of frel work, (as it is now usual in the Gregian archery,) were considerably higher the roof. The roof, surmounted by a light stone balvstrade, was covered 6y a beautiful tile of Turkey, under a strong Corsican linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surriched, the Greeks pass their ovcnings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating frvit, and enjoying the perpetual breeze.\nOn the left hand, we cnlawed the house, a little strecllet slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens, we clustered togethor on the borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a seat of marhle with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and about twelve hours, reading, writing, arid speaking to hiinself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday.\"\nThe view of this seat was wbat perhaps called \"a life of bird's eyes.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bl0om, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decomposition. A smal1 stream from the ruiris descended into broken waterfalls, it was lost in the wood ncar the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a hori2on unshaded0 by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of high and palm chesriut, several small islands have been observed distinclly, spreading the blue waveight with spots of green eraud. I rarely enjoyed a uiew more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful cls lo the name of the person who hcld resided iri this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"Armenian,\" said our leader, \"could say, I'm sure he won't, he says, and you'll tell your friend, if I can, he says, I don't dare. We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but in the afternoon back to the bass, we learned scveroI particular of the isolate. He had shared eight young girlets that he was 1st on the island, and had even danced with the ins at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articlcs. He also bought a ncw b0at for a fisberman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments for poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, to hclve was a very ecenlar and benev0lent charaoter. Ono circumstance we learned, that our old friend or cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use him.\nThese were the information with which we left Srom the island of Peacefu1 of Mityleno; our imagiriatioris everything on the rack, gvesfing which this rambling in Greece could be. He had money it was obvious: he had the disposition philarithropy, on all these eccentric ideas that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architecl, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sold him, \"ahout who you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I methjm in my travels on the island of Tenedos, I also alivened him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of hjs lordsbip, as we had been a few years from home; bul \"Child Horolde\" being put in our hands we recognized the recluf of Calcla in each page. Didn't we regret not being more curious in our hillside petitions, but we became angry with the lho idea of returning to Mitylene on the same day, but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. He described bcen as an insensitive disposition, inverse to the association with hvman nclure, or contributing to any wcly to appease his grief, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be clearly collected from these clriecdots litt1e. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tcdnerness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at rest of s0litude is an additional reason to mark him as a being whose heart Roliglon halh sealed and whose pearl Benevolence threw away his coat. No man can read the precedjng plisirig \"trajts\" without feeling proud of him a securityman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. There are always relations with the cautiori, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and the one who dares to justify it is pointed out that the horrific court that everything must appear, only can censor the errors of the homos-mortai. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his geniuses. To do good in the dry, and to reject the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heclrt and self-approval conscience.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prlnter, Crown Court, Fleet-strcet.",
    "43": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Wil1iain Polidori\nTHE superstiti0n on which this tale is based so very general iri the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be commori n: jt, however, does not extend to the Greeks if it is after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the division of the Latiri and Greek churches; at the time wbich, the idea of becoming dominant, that cl Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful stories, up to 1, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the yovrig and beauty1. In the West, with a certain variation in ligature, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the beief existed, the vampyres at night1y soaked a certain porlion of Tbe blood from their victims, which became emaciated, lost the strength of Tbeir, arid died quickly from consumption; while these fattened human blood suckers — and their becamo veins dissolved to such a state of repletiori, in order to cause the blood of al1 to flow through the bodies, and even the pores themselves from their skins.\nIri the London Journal, of Mareh, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible, on a particular case of vampyrism, which is blocked for having taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the Place de Tbe, that it has been consistently asserted, that about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nclmed Arnold Poul, had heard said 6oen, that, in Cassovla, on the borders of the Turkish Seruia, he had been torried by a varpyre, but had found a way to get rid of the spoon, by eating irig part of the earpiece of the tomb of the vampyre, on rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a hirnself vampy; for, about twenty or thirty days after his declemation and burial, many people complained of having hoen tormented by him, and the aposllion was made, that the hcld sour people were deprived of 1fee by his attacks. To prevent even more malice, the inhabitants who hated consulted their Hadagni, up to 0k in the body, and found jt (as it is assumed to be usval in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely ash corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure arid florid blood. The havirig evidence was therefore abtclinated, he resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely pushed through Arnold Pclul's home and body, where he is a reporter for shouting so terribly as if he had been Alivc. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the oorses of those people who had previovsly died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, iri lheir tour, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre arrives a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems better adapted lo i1lvstrate the subject of the observa-\nThere are no other factors that could be invoked. In many parts of Greece, it is believed as a kind of punishment after death, for the same heinous crime committed while it existed, that the deceased is not only given to vampyriso, but is forced to consinute his infernal visitolions as well as to those beings he loved the most wbile vpon earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition widespread in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vclmpyro sent, thy corse shall be torn from his tomb; and then shall haunt the native land, and suck blo0d with all thy sack; from thence of thy daughter, fister, wifo, about midnight drain the street of life; yet loclth the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corfe, thy victims, are they yet exhaled, Shalje know the devil for their sire; as thou cursedst them, thou cursedst them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shalje blessed Ihee with the riam of a father—This one will wrap your hcart in flame! Yet you have put an end to your task and marked the 1aft tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glaze of glass must see who releases zeso'er his lifeless blue; Then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in ilfe a lack wben shornThe tenderest commitment of Affection has been worn— But n0w is worn oway by the memorial of your clgonia! Yol with your own best 6l0od will flow; Tby grinning tooth, and hagard's lip; Then stalking at your sul1in fall, Go – and with Gouls and Afritsrave, until those in horror shrink away from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful poet of \"Thalaba\", tbe vampyre Corsica os lhe Arabianwelness Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormentirig hlm that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be posed for having resulted from the sinfu1nefs of her life, she being pulled away through the whole of history as a complete type of purity and innocence. The vorcious Tovrnefort gives a long story in his lravs of amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work vpon thif fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionalistics illustriative of effects, put by far some learned dissertations, harassing to prove it t0 to be a ssical cla, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions or this singularly horrible superstition could be odd; th0ugh the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devolved to explanatjon, arid that can now be concluded by inerly remarkjng, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several athers synonym wjth it, makes use af iri different parts of the world: like Vrovcolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Br0ucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt was in the midst of the altendant dissipations of a L0ndon wlnter that the Uariouf porties of the ton chiefs appeared a noble, moreremarkab1e for its singularities, than its rank. He was watching the mirlh around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apprenticely, the Light laugh of the fair drew his attention, so that he could by cl look at the calm, and throw the fear jnto thoso breasts where carelessness rciigned. Those who felt this feeling of clwe, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and suddenly t0 percent through the iriward work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on tbe skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be enlisted in every house; everyone had fun seeing him, and those who hod beeri accustomed to vilerit ex citation, and now it is the misfortune of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to engage attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, while neuer acquired a warmer hue, either running away from the b1ush of modesty, or from the strong tbe einolion of passion, although her sorine and its contours were beautiful, many female hunters tried to win her tauntians, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had drunk the mockery of every monster worn in the sineo drawing rooms her marriage, threw herfelf into her way, and did everything except put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her opinion:—although jn vain:—wheri she kicked herself in front of him, tough her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that thoy were unperceived;—even her unapplaudiated impudence was flouted, and she left fie1d. But the adultery of the cominon could not influence even the greed of his eyes, it was not tbat the female sex was indifferent to hiin: yot such was the cauti0n appendel with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he addressed him to the females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and while it is true that he even aborted fear of its singular character, or that they were moved by its appearance of hatred of vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex from their domestic virtues, as clamoring those whom they ate by their vices.\nAt about the same time, Thero came to London a young man of the name 0f Aubrey: he wos an orphcln 1ft wilh a single sister in possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in chiIdgood. Left to himself by the guardians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important burden of his mind, that of taking care of mcrcenary subaltorns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had romantic feelings of honor and frankness, which destroyed so many apprentices every day. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vjce was thrown iri by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effecl of the scene, as we soe in Romanoes: he tant that the misery of cottage simply consisting in the jacket of clothes, wbich were also hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by t heir irregular folds and various patches col0urcd. He says, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. It is beautiful, franicist and rich: for these reasons, upori its entry into gay circles, rnany mathers surraunded hirn, striuing whoh bould descri6e wilh lea st truth tbeir languishing or roaring fauovrites: the girls at the same time, by their mishaps when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hls lps, soon led him to false notions af for his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, was surprised to find ng, that, with the exception of iri the tallow and wax candles tbat clicked, not of the presence of a ghosl, but of the war of sniffing, there was no foundation in the real life f0r none of these congreries of pleasant picturcs and disseripti0ns bounded jn these volumes, from where he had formed the study of the hls. However, finding some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreclms, which was the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him iri his career.\nHe looked at him, and the impossibility of forming an idecl of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observatory of external objects, which he tacitly clings to their existence, implored by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that slattercd his propensity to cxtravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object inlo le bero of a romclnce, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He learned with him, paid him attentlons, and, until now, advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recognised. Little by little he learned that Lord Ruthveri's case was broken, and he soon found, from the notes of the preparatlon on the street, that he was about to travel. Desjrous af gain some information respect this singular character, which, until now, had only struck his curiosity, he hlnt to his tutors, it was time for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the clroer of vice-lows putting thcmsolves on an equcllljty witb the old, and not allow them to appear as if fallcn frorn the heavens, whenever the fcandal intrigues are mentioned as svbjects of plisclntry or praise, according to the degree of skill they had to carry them. Thyy consented: and Aubrey iminediatery mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a morque of esteem of him, who, apparently, bad anything common iri with other men, to be gl adly accepted, and jn a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, lhat, tangb much more of his acts have been exposed to the sight of hls, the results have offered different conclusions of his apparent motives t0 his conduct. His componion was pr0fuse in his liberality; — the lazy, the vagclbond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to re...\nGive them their immediate needs. Bul Auhrey could not auoid notice, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the seated misfortunes euen on vlrtue, that he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent back to the spirit of rich charity. This rainbow wcls, attributed by him to the greatest importunity of the vicious, which would gcnerally prevail on the retreat chest of the virulent needy. Tbere was a circumstance about the cbclrity of his Lordsbip, who was even more impressed upwards with his inirid: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that the here was a curse on her, because lhey were all led to the soaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the rnost abject mufery. In Brussels and other thrugb lowris that they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent exasperation that his companion sought for the centers of all fusbionnable vices.\nHe bet, and has always played successfully, except where the best known was his clnlagonist, and then he lost evon more than he won; but he has always been with the immutable lazy face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met you he erupted-\nnovice, or the unlucky father has a numeroouf family; then if uery wishes to secede the law of fortune — this abstrclctedness clpparent of the mind was set aside, on his eyes glittered with more fjre than that of the cat while deliring with tho half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the cjrcle which he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fatc tbat had drawn him inside the mass of this flotilla; there were many father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking mute h ungry chiIdren, with a whole piece of land at his late jmmensewealtb, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he does not look like money from the game; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: tbis could but be the result of a rough eertain of knowledgc, which, however, was not capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey oflen wanted to denounce him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which he proved to be ruining of all, the clnd did not take care of his own profit; — but he delayed him — for whenever he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speculate frankly and openly to him; however, lbis never dared. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the valour of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyo spoke less than his iip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain any more gratification from him thcln the constant excitatory to want vainly to break this myftère, which to his imaginative exaltation began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey were soon adorned in Rome, and Aubroy lost for a while the sigh of his companion; he left him in daily presence until the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went into the sea of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters irritated fram England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing of affection bvt; the athers came from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was bad power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on leaving his friend immediately, and urged, that his charclcter was terribly vicious, for the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made his licentious habits swear dangerous to society. He had been disembodied, and his contempt for adultery had no origin in the hatred of his character; but he had demanded, for enhclnce bis gratification, that his uictim, the associate of his guilt, be cast out from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, a1l the women whom he had sought, apparently had not, since his departure, cast the mask even apart, and had not scrupulously-\nhas led to exposing the total deformity of their viccs to the public.\nAubrey determined on leavi ng one, whose character had not yet fhown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. Hc resolved to invent a pretext of plavsib1e to abandon it completely, by seeking, in the whilc sense, to do it closer, and not to allow any light circumstances to pass 6y nonnoljced. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose main care he was dealing with the house. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; he has therefore ohligaged to continue his planf in secret; Aubrey's eye falsified him in all his windings, and soon discovered that the ari assignment had been supplemented, which would probably be rnost in the ruin of an innocent girl, though thought1. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly asked him for his intentionf with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to calm down at night. Lord Ruthven became inflamed, that his intentions were subb cls he assumed that everything would have on such an occasion; and after being pressed whenher he irigent to marry him, simply lavghed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a no e, to say, that from that time he must refuse to accompany irig his lordship in the rest of their proposed day, he ordered bis servant to search for other apartments, and called the mother os tbe lady, informed his af all that he knew, not only with regclrd to his daughter, but also about the character of his lordship. The subpoena was prevented. L0th The next day Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey went to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, fon faund himself cl Athens. He set up his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of drawing the erased records of ancient gIory on m0numents which apparently, shameful of chronic jng the acts of Freoineri only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many e0loured lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, lhclt could have formed the model away a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope af tbe flithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she could helorig to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, oria would have thought the gazelle a type p0 or its beauties; for wbo would have exchclnged her eye, apparently the eye of animated noir, for luxurious sleeping tbot 1ook of the animal adapted 6ut to the taste of an epic. Ianthe's light step often accompanied Aubrcy in his search for antiquities, and after would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, as he was on the wind, to the ardour of him, who forgave the letters that he had just dccyphered on an almost erased tablet, in the contemplation of his figurative sylph. Often, her braids would fall, if she wilted, would display in the shades so bright and so quickly weakening of the antiquarian, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let her mind simmer the objecl before thinking of the vital importence to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pclusanias. But why try to denigrate the charms while feeling, but no one can appreciate?—He wcls innocence, youlh, and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms clnd suffocating balls. As he drew the remains of which he wished to keep a memorjal for his future hours, shc stood, and looked at the rnagjc effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of the native land ber; she would then describe to hjm the circular dance on the plain ocon, painted, lo he in all the dazzling eolours of the youthful memory, the marriage p0mp she remembered vibrating in her childhood; and then, turning los subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on the ber spirit, told bim ail the supernatural tclles of the nurse ber. Her fervour and her belief in what she was telling, aroused the very greatest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of this vain living father, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and dear bonds, forced everyone, feeding on the life of a pretty woman to prolong her exislence of the erising months, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh out of the idle sucking and drinking fantasies; but Ianthe quoted to her the dwarfs of the old men, who at last discovered one living among them, a severol behind their relatives relatius and children had found bcen marked with the seal of the fleet's appetite; an arid wheri that she found so incredulous, she 6th sighed at him to believe that she had been, renarked, tbat thase that had dared their existence, that she had always found bit so incredulous, that she had confessed, that she had it, that she had it. She detailed to him the traditional aspect of these monsters, ond her horror was iricreased, with a rather acovrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, archaic, persisted in persuading her, that thero cou1d would not be the truth in her fears, although at the time sarne he wondered about the coincidences rnany wbich had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his jnnocence, so contrasted by the offoeoted virtues of the women among whom he had sought to have fun, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without due, he found himself even more bimbotinated to the almost fairy-like form before him. He was tearing her bimselsat times, and, sleeping a plari far from some antiquarjan rescarch, ho wauld gone, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, when iri his mind, he retained a shot image seemed alone the possessor of righlfvl of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconsciaus af his love, and was always the same frank child he had first knawn. She moved away from him with lucidity; but it was that the hecavse sbe no longer had anyone with wbom shc could not visit his favorite hauntings, that his guardian was busy at sketehirig or to discover a fragment that had still dared to destructlve lime hclnd bones. She had appealed to her parents on the Suhjeot of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed the existence of TBE, pale with horr0r in the name itself. Soon Aubrey decided to make one of the excursions of hjs, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both not to come back at night, since he had to pass through a wood, that no Greek ever reborn, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imperative on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrcy saw the representatives of Jr, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw them trembling, his audacity to mock himself in this way with a superior, infernal power, the very name of the very name which, apparently, was freed from blood, was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that the bi-words, mixing the belief of these horrible proud, hcld inspired them with such terror. Ianthe, whom he took care of, came to the side of his horde, and went forth fervently with him to avenge himself, and at night lifted up the power of these beings to be put into action; — hc promised. He was, however, so busy in his researeh, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of the thase spocks which, in the warmer climates, quickly gathered irito a mass of tromendous, and poured all their rage over the devoted country.—He, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by the speed for his delay: but he wcls too late. The twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it had advanced far, there was above the storm, the echoes of thunders had barely a lnterval of rest, its thick rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue highling seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly his horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible speed through the wood set in motion. The oimal finally, through fatigue, stoppcd, and found, by the glare of bone, that it was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not rise from the masses of shredded leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that someone would guide him to the city, or at least shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a silent moment, allowed him to raise the terrible screams of a woman who was mingling with mockery, exulting and mocking a laugh, continued in an almost irrigated bourbier; — he was surprised; but, excited by the thurder who, once again, was rolling on his head, or, with a sudden effort, forcod opened the door of the hut. It was found in total darkness: sound, however, guided hjm. It seems that he was not perceived; sor, tough, he called, still the sounds countered, and no advice was taken from him. He found hjmseIf in c0ntact with someone, whom he immediately seized; wben a way cried out, \"Again bafsled!\" He felt struck by orians whose strength seemed superhuman: dissuaded from selling the life of bis as dearly as he could, he struggled; he read against him in vain; he rose from his feet tight with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself on a bim, and knelt on his chest, had laid his hands on his sling; when the glorch of many torches penetrating into the hole that fills the light in the day, disturbed hjm;—he rose up instantly, and, throwing his prey, cast down the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by tbose WITHBUT. They entered, the light of their lords spread on the walls of the mud, and the thcltoh loaded on the eueri individjdual fraw with heavy soot flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey, they sought her who had struck him with his cries; he was again afraid to sink; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, behold, perceive the ajry form of his beautiful tanned conductor in a corse without life. He closed his eycs, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his disturbed imogination; bvt he saw again the same forrn, when he unlocked them, extended by the hls side. There was no co1our on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face lhat seemed alinosl as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and vpon his throat were the marks 0f teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid on the side of the hcr who recently asked him for the object of so much brigbt and fiiryuisions, now fallen with the flower of life tbat had died wilhin it. Ho did not know that his thoughts carried whale, his mind was inflamed and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held unconsciously almast in the hand bis a bare dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the cabin. The thoy was soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search for hcr that a molher had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cjty, would prevent the parents from the terrible catastrophe. —To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Au6rey, arid, poached at the c0rese. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey bcing put to bed wcls seized with the most violent fever, and was often dellri0us; in these intervals he was going to otter on Lord Ruthven and vpon Ianthe — by some unaccourable cambination, he began to beg for his former complnion to spare him from being loved. At other times, he permeated the mcllegations on the head of bis, and cursed the hive as his deslroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about Aubrey's slate, immediately placed his son in the same house, and embodied his constant companion. When he roused his delirium, he was horrified and scattered in the sight of him whom he had tied with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, almost repented of the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the intention, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled bim to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; 6t as soori as his convalescence numbed to be fast, he gradually removed the same state of mind from the irito, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meddle his gaze firmly fixed on him, with a smile of insulting exultation playing on his lip: hc did not know why, hut this smi1e haunted. During the last slage of the invalid, Lord Ruthvcn wos seems to commit himself to watching the tideless waves rise hy thc cool breeze, or to marking the progress of these orbs, circumcise, like our world, the sun without rnovity;—in fact, it seemed wisb to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mirid, by the shock of the thjs, was greatly weakened, and this spirit of elasticity which had once so distinguished vishcd it now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as fond of solitary silence as Lord Ruthven; but just as he had heed for solitude, his spirit, o0uid n0t the firid in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the vines which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ionthe stood near his sidec – if he was looking for him in the wadf, his step of 1ight seems wandering in the undergrowth, in the quest for the purple modcst; then suddenly would turn around, show, to his wild imagination, his face of pclle and wounded tbroclt, with a sweet smile on his lips hor. He has decided to steal scenes, each of which has created associations subb bjtter in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held hlmfelf bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during the hls ilries, that they could not visit these parts of Greece nor had they yet seen. They traveled in the direction of the Eury, and sought each place to remember a memory; but although they were in a hurry from place to place, they seemed to ignore the whale they were looking at. Thoy heard a lot of robbers, but they began grooving these relationships, which they imagined were only the invention af individualf, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of thase that they defended against alleged dangers. Curiously, neglecting the advice of the inhobitantf, they once traveled with a few guards, m0re to serve as guides rather than guides. When entering, however, a nclrraw defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torch, with large masses of rocks descended into the neigbbourant precipices, they had reason to repent tbeir nogligonce; for hardly was the whole tbe of the party engaged in the narrow collar, when it was starred by the whistling balls 0f near the head, and by the ratio echo of several cannons. In a number of them, the guards had them, and, complaining behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the dlrrction when the report came. Lard Ruthuen and Aubroy, imitating their copy, stopped for a rnoment behind the turning sheltered from defilement; but shameful to be thus detained by an enemy, who, with no knowledge of the sade tbem shuls, advanced, and to be exposed to a massacre without resistance, if one of the thieves were to ascend above and take TBem into the reor, they immediately decided to rush into the sea of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock of Tobe, when Lord Ruthven received a schist in his shoulder, whicb led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer holding his help or his own pcril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthven's wounded, immediately sunk their arms and surrender.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and after accepting a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, since there was only to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthven's strength declined rapidly; in two days the rnortification followed, and Dcath seemed to move forward quickly. His coriduct and apprehension had not changed; he seemed as incoherent in the pain as he had been objects that accompanied him; but towards the end of the evening, the bis spirit became at ease, and the bis eye often set on Aubrcy, who was jnduced to offer his help with more seriousness than usual—\"Assist me! I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need only a little, my Iife ebbs apace, I can explaln the whole, but if you know it well, my honor was fréo de la spot in the mouth of the world, and if my deatb was known for some time at Engla nd, I—but life.\"We will not know it.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising himself with exultary violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear it, for a year and a day you will have no knowledge of my crimes or of every living being in any way whatsoever, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with their sookets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he mocked his pillow and no longer breathed.\nTo the brey withdrew to rest, but did not move; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose upon his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath a trembling oam upon him, as if the presentation of horrific somcthing awaited him. The ear rising 1y in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, wben a thief met him, and made him hear that he was n0 longcr there, havjng was transmitted by himself and the comrades, on his reliri ng, to the pirinaclo of a nearby outside, according to a p romjse, they had given his seigneury, that he ejected t0 the first cold ray of the moori thal rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several bones the men, decided to go and bury on the place where he was. But, queri hc had died your tho top to be found no trace of either body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the idenlic rock on which they misposed the body. For some time his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they buried the corpse in the love of clothes.\nWeary af a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in whjch all apparently conspired to heighteri that the superstitious melancholy that had seized his mind, to be determined to leave her, and saon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a essel to pass it on to Otranto, or to Naples, he took care of rounding up the effects he had with him by begging Lord Rulhven. Among other things, there has been the corruption of several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to the death of the victim. There were secral daggers and ataghans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, which was his surprise to find a gerbe apparently adorned in the same foot as the dagger disappeared in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to get a stealth proof, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined that He discovered that he was equivalent, although especially shapod, to the sheath he held in the hand of hjs. His eyes seemed not to need a furthcr certainty – they tried to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular sorme, the variable shades of the samc on the haft and the sheath were al ike in the splendor on the botb, and left no noise for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his hoine path, in Rome, the first investigations were about the lady he had tried to remove seductive arts from Lord Rutbven. Her parents were in distress, their f0rtune ruined, and she had not been heard bone since the departureuro of her seigneury. Aubrey's mirid became the broken alinost under so many repeated executioners; he was afraid that this lady had falsified a victline at Ianthe's destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his 0nly occupied0n consjsted by exhorting the speed of the postilionf, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived in Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, s0one threw him on the EngIish shores; he hastened to the master house of his magnifiers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his sister's arid caresses, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile claws, she had gained her effect, now that the woman began to approach, she was even more altabbing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that victorious groceries who won the look and applause of the clsemblief de salon. There was none of this light brilliance that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His 6luo eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a fleshy melancholy about it that seemed to arise from a mesfortune, but from some feigning wilhin, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which wanders where or a butterfly or a color mcly attract – it was sedate ond pensive. When alone, her face was not illuminated by the smile of joy; but that her brother crushed her affection, and would forget in her presence those deed that she knew destroyed hjs rost, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still on eighteen, and n0t had been introduced to the world, it was thought by his more able guardian lhal hor presentati0n should be delayed until the return of his brother fr0m orientate him, when he could be his protector. It was riow, theresore, solved lbat the next living room, which approached quickly, blurred the cpoch from the entrance of the ber into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the house of his fathers, and fed melancholy bim bich ov erpowered. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, that his mind had been so torn by the ants he had seen; but he detamines to socrfied with his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon stopped in the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-ro0m had not held 6 for a long time, and all those who were anxious t0 bass in the smile of the kingship, they hasten. Aubrey was there with her sister. When he stood in a corner by himself, listened to all the people around him, engulfed in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there—hc felt himself bribed by the clrm, and that a voice was too well recognized, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn around, fearing of seeing a spectre that would explode him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place at the first entrance of bis into society. He looked until his alm0st members refused to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself jnto his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with horrjed steps, ond fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin – circumstancos began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his 0ath.—He woke up, he could not believe it was possible – the decredive ascent agairi!—He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be straightened — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he tried to conjure the Lord Rutbven, the name of a tbe hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later, to his sister's mind, to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and gave to his own eating breads. When he finally saw several people leaving, he woke up and entered the other r0om, found his sieve surrounded by several, he appeared in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he begged to move, tumed r0und, ond revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. He took his sister's orna, and, with a hurry, forced hor to the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the crowd of seruants who were a waiter for their lords; and while he was passing them, he heard again the voice of thal whisperer at hjm — \"Remove your oath!\" — He dared not dye, but, sends his sister, soon rcacbcd to the house.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before he had the evil mind was absorbed by a subjcct, how much more completely was he absorbed, now that tbe eertainty 0f the life of innouncing him again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now without regard, and it was in vain that she would irritate her to explain to her what had cavsed hjs coriduct abrupt. Ho spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he ate, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised him;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin on bis breatb, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid progress? Maybe his sister was overthrown by him. Bul, even if he violated his oath, and revealed his suspect, who would believe him? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from misery; but death, he recalls, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw rio one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with peeking eyes, was assisting him, for his own good, to support ours. Finally, he is no longer able to support and loneliness, he leaves his home, wanders frorn slreot on the street, anxiovs to steal this image that haunted him. The dress of Hjs became neg1e, and it waridered, as often exposed to the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was not a loriger to recognize; he turned to the house at first in the evening; but at last he laid him down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sisler, anxjous f0r his safety, used to follow hjm; but they were soon removed by the hive that fled from a swifter chaser than any — from thought. His behavior, however, suddenly got bad. Struck by the idea that he left with his absence all his friends, with ofiend among them, whose precence they were unconscious, he decided to cnter again inlo society, and the watcb narrowly, anxious avant-garde, despite his oath, a1l who in LordRuthven approached with intim acy. But when he entered o r0om, his hamburgers and his 1ook suspects were so strikirig, his inner shivers so visible, that his sister was finally forced to ask him to darken up the sce-\nKing, for her, a society that infected her so strongly. However, when the repetition proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they had the great time to take back the rust that had been imposed upon them before by Aubrey's parents.\nIn an effort to save him from the wounds and suffering he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they consider to be madness, lhoy asked a doctor to reside in the house, and to take care of him with toughness. He seemed to notice, so completely his mind absorbed 6y a terrible subject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was c0nfined in his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, the eyes bis had atllinated a glazed chandelier; — if only a sign of clffection and recoIlectremainirig showed himself at the entrance of his sister; then even as the times would begin, and, by licking his hands, with the thal ercemently distressed glances, he desired that she would not praise hlin. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him!\" However, when she asked whom it was necessary to refer, her only answer was: \"True! Trpc!\" And again ho sank in a state, from which she couldn't shave it. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his incoherences became less frequent, gripped his mind threw a porlion of his morosity, while his guards obferved, that several times in the day he wovld counl on his fingers a certain number, and then smiled.\nThe time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entered his room, began to convorise with his doctor on the melancholic circumstances of Aubrey's beirig in such a terrible sltuatiori, when his sister was gojng the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked Wbom with anxiety. Happy with this mark of return jntellect, because they feared that he had been deprived, they reneged on the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count who had been met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They responded to the riot, but in a few miriutes his sister was with him. He was apparently able to be struck by the inflection of his beautiful smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of the being of his brother orrice swears alive to the eyes of affection. He began to splatter with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage, a person so distinguished for his rank and all his achievements; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which was surprised hift to jostling the features of the monster who had so long invaded his life. Hc grabs the portra in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under the fool. On her asking him why he tbused destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—and hen sizirig her tapes, looking at her with a frantic excrescence of face, he told her to swear that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not advance—it seemed that this voice made him remember his oath—he suddenly turned around, Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the gvardions and the doctor, who had heard the whole tbo, and who thought it was a return of his disorder, entered, and Miss Aubrey's forcing, tried to leave him. Ho feli on his knees to them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the folly that they imagined had taken posfesaccording to his mind, were striving to plcify bim, and retreated.\nLord Ruthven had called Mom's clerk the living room, and had been reused with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood that he was the cause; but when he had learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleosure could hardly be corroborated by the information he had slipped. Hc hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by his dismaying attendance, and he pretenoes great asfectian for the house closed and interest in his destiny, he gradually wanted Miss Avbrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to resign—could speak of hirnself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on a crowded ear, sowing with his ta which he addressed himself;—could say how, since ho knowher, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, could he simply listen to his soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or that was the destiny of the will, that he gave him effects. The title of the elder branch that fell to him at the entrance, he obtained an importing embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state), which was to take place the day before his deportation to the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servarits, but in vain. He wrote a letter to her sister, the conjvrng, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who command her in their arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest m0 curses. Tbe servanls promised that they would deliver it; but give it to the doctor, he thought it better not to harass any mare Miss Aubrey's mind by, what hc considered, greasing a mclnioc. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the huso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than descrjbed, the notes of occupied preparatian. Camo in the morning, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Avbrey grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the serrants finally exceeded their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of an old womani helpless. He seizes the opportunity, with a b0und was out of lhe raom, and in a moment is in the apartment where all were almost assembled. And the LORD Ruthven was the first to pierce him; and he came to himself immediately, and took his arm by force, and cast him out of the room, without a voice, with fury. On the stairs Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brilliance until this day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the elder's wife, had become a lover in search of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury had no running vent, had burned a vase of blood, and he was carried to bed. This riot was mentioned to his sjster, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid of the agitatirig her. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom were afraid that Loridon.\nAubrey's weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guordians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he told what the reader had perpetuated, and immediately died.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. L0th Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of hjm, wbere to choose his place of rest, and Prouence his guide.\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we placed in the prefect of Mltylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi af bovine arid vegetables still in bo had there, lead many British vescls to visit it — both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smy-\nPremiums are largely reimbursed for income tax.\nIt's a trip. We landed; as ufual, at the cauldron of the bay, arid that the men were employed in watering, and pvrster trading for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself look a ramble at the cave cailed Homer's School, and other places, where we had bccn before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a Greek y0ung as our guide, who told us to come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival iri his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and he would have put me in danger; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I might be married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house of honey, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in the chclrge of him: he gave Dominick, wine-trader, fix a hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English ovrence,) and resided there about fourteen moriths, but not constantly; for he saIs in his felucca very desleri to the various islands.\"\nThis curiosity attracted us a lot, and we did not waste time hastening into the house where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who bore us over a private hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bed-roorn, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decoratcd: plclin green-stained wails, unstoppable tables 0n be faithful, a great myrtle in the center, and o small\nntain below, whjch could be made to play through the hranchos 6y by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a bent pedture; a large couh or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrars, nor a single painting. The bcdchamber simply had a mattress of lclrge lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a salad – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a rees of marble, once, the old man told us, filled wilh books and paper, whjch then carried in a great best of sailor in the claset: it was open, but we did not think 0urselves justissied by examining the coritenls. On the tablet of the rece ss are Vallaire, Shakespeare'f, Boileau's and Rousseau'f complete works; the Ruinsof Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopftock; the novels of Kotzebve; the p1ay af the Robbcrs of Sohiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constarinotinople, torn mueh, but no English book of descrjption. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was ljtera1ly grib bled alI ovcr, and marked witb flips of paper, on whieh too were remarks.\nThe old husband said, \"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for hc is so special, that I have moved a thing with orders of 0ut, he would sling upon me for a hesitation together. Being is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once, and I had the farm produced for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins that I have pcly to an elderly Armenian who resides in the small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale.\"\nThe appearance of the outer dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty paccs long and fourteen wide, and the flutcd marble pillars with pljnths black clnd carnices of cargo work, (cls it is now usual in the Greek arena,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stoning balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse fort Iinen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pass tbeir evenerigs smoking, drinking great wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and taking advantage of the breeze evenerig.\nFor fear that they would enter the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, orariges and lindens clustcrjng together on the edges, and vnder the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a seat marblc wilh a back of ornarntal wood was placed, or we were told, the lord passamany of his enigres and nights until dawn, reading, writing, and at 1king to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, besides Sunday.\"\nThe uiew of the seat of Thjs was what can be called \"a f-yo bird view.\" A line of rich vjneyards 1st eye of lbe on Mount Ccllcla, covered with olive trees and myrtlo trees in blaom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple seemed majestic rotten. A small creek from the ruins defceri ded in the coscades of brokeri, until it is lost jn the woods near the base of the mountain. The sca smooth like glass, and a hor...\nizon, not overshadowed by a single cIoud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, near a view of high chesnvt and palrn-trees, several small islands were distinctly abservod, spreading the light blue wave with emerald greon spolf. I rarely enjoyed a larger view than I did; but our demands were unsuccessful as to the Persian thc namo that had resided in his romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said ovr conductor, \"could say, \"I'm sure he won't do it,\" \"and can't you say, old money?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We did not have the time to vjsit the Armenian, but upon our return to the bass, we learned severaI particulars af tho seigneur isolated. He had shared eight young girls when he was lost on the island, and even danced with lhem at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the gjrls who live by weaving these items. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and osten gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all we have understood, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage should not reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Iord was often seen walking on the sea-part, and he had bought him a piano-forle, and had taught him the use of jt.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imaginations everything on the rock, guessing that its rambling Iri Greece could be. Hc had money, it was greedy: he had philanthropy of dispositlon, and al1 lh0se eccntricities whicb marks the peouliary genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled.\nThat's him. Falling in the company of Mr FOSTER, the archbitec, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he said, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the island of Tenedos, and I visited him in Mitylene.\" We had heard of the fame of hjs lordship, as we have been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pul int0 our hands wo recognized the rocluse of Calcla in each page. We deeply regretted not having been more curious in our gazes at the coltage of TB, but we will console our thoughts with the idea of resuming at Mitylene some sulphurous day; but behold, that day will never return. I rinse this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of its seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as of an insensitive disposition, averso Toassociant wilh hurnon nature, or contributing in any way to sohth his pains, or adding to his plcasuref. The fact is directly the opposite, cls can be clearly collected from these small anecdotes. All the finest Seeli...\nThe ngs of the heart, so elegantly inlaid in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tondity, fympathy and thority seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of loneliness is an additional repulsive to mark him as a being on the heart whate Religion Halh has put his seal, and on whose head Berievo1ence has cast his coat. No man can read the preoeding foldng \"trats\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his Ioves or his pleasures are concerned, I do not suppose a right t0 to give an opinjon. The reports are always to bc roeived wilh calion, especially when djreeted clgainst the moral lawlessness of the rnan; etho who dares to justify himself before this awsu1 court where all must approach, cllone can cede the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's chclracter is worthy of his genius. For the good in secret, arid departs from the application of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END\nGillot, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "44": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Wil1iam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which the tbis tale is based is very general in the East. Am orig the Arabians it seems to be common: it does not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of the Chrislianity; and it has taken its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, tbat a Latin body could not corrupulate if it was buried in the territory, it gradually increased, and formed the sujeet of many wonderful storio, still existing, of the deod rising from their groves, and feeding on the blood of the young and houtiful. In the West, he spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres were imbibing at night part of the certclin blood of their victims, who became emaciatodes, lost their strength, and died spoedilly of consumptions; while these suckers of human blood grew — and their cues became distended to such a state of repulsion, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skjns.\nIn the London Joumal, around March 1732, is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, whatb is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hurigary. It seems, on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, that, positively and unanimously asfirinated, that about five years earlier, an oertain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been hcard to say, lhat, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had begged by a varpyr, but had found a way to rid him of the curse, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyr, and to rub himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from scorning a vampy himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, lhat four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to prevent the inhabitants from consecrating their Hadagni, took the body of Tbe, and found it (as is supposed to be done in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely secreted corruption, and emitting clt the Mauth, no., and ears, pure and slorid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stakc was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have cried so terribly or as if he had been alive. 6 And they cut off his head, and endured his body, and cast ashes into his grave. The same measures were odified with the thosc corses who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal helief is, that a perfonsucked by a vampyr becomes a hlinself vampyr, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of the usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here related, becauso it secms ceterer adapted to illustrate the subjecl of these observations tban any instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment astering death, for a heinous crime committed while it exists, tal hel decea-\nsed is not condemned to vampyria, but is obliged to confide in bis infernaI visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by the bonds of arid affétion.—A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy oorse shall be torn from his sepulchre; and the place of the ncltuus, and shall suck the blood of all thy seed; thy daughter, sister, and wife, threshing at midnight shall drain the ruin of life; and yet hate the banquet that shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, even they shall perish, and shall know the devil to heir sire: as ye cursed, thou cursed Ihem, Tby flowers are full of spirit upon the stem. But a fight for your crime must fall, The youngest, the most loved of all, will wrap You with the riam of a father, This word will engulf your heart in flames! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cbeek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who ejaculates his lifeless blue; then, with the unhalifted hand, will tear the braids of his hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — but now is b0rne far from you Mcmorial of your agony! And thy blood shall flow, thy gnashing tooth, and thy heave lip; and thou shalt hunt thy sul1eri sepulchre, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more bound than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild poem of \"Thaloba\", the varpyrous corse of the Arab rnaid Oneiza, which is represented by the bone having re-tubated gravo with the aim of tormenting it, she washed the best while it existed. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sobriety of ber lifc, it was spread through the whole tae as a complete type of purity and irinocence. The true Toumefort is a long rush in his journeys of several amazing cases of vampyrisin, to which he claims hclve boen an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradjtionary accounts illustrating its effects, has published some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explenaison, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the oon in m0st genera1 acceptatiori, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the beginning of the thc's dissipations accompanying a London winter, it appeared to the various panios of the leaders a ton a noble, more noticed for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, Tbe Fair's light laughter drew his attention only, so that he could by al0ok extinguish it, and fear in these breasts wbere thovghtlessries reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain what it was up to: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, staring on the obiect's face, did not seem to penetrate, and suddenly, topierce through the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to be invited to all the houses; all were impatient to see him, and the thase that had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were raining something in their prosenoo able to attract the attention of our attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, eitber of the blush of modesty, or of the slrang ernotiori of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to win attitudes bis, and galn, at least, some marks of what they were talking about affection: Lady Meroer, who had beentho inockery of each monsler worn in the drawing-roorns since her marriage, threw sounds in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a montebank, to attract her attention:—although in uan:—when she stood before him, although her eyes apparently fixed on her, it seemed that they were not piggy;—even her unapplied impudence was bclffled, and she left the field of Tbe. But even if the common adulllefs could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not the female fex that was indifferent to him: yet it was the apparent cautiori with wbioh that he spoke to the vi rious wife and innocent daughter, that few knew that he was ever addressing t0 females. However, he had the reputation of a tungning tongve; and if it was there that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they mocked his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among those women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook him by their vices.\nAt about the same time he arrived in London a gentleman yovng from Aubrey's riam: he left an orphan with an ony sister in the possession of great wealth, by porents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to him by guardians, who are only taking care of his forlon, while they give up the most jumportant charge of his mlnd to the guard of simple subalterns, he cultivates his imagination moro only his iudgment. So he has this high regal feeling of h0nour and candor, which every day ruiris so mclny milliners apprentices. He believed to sympathize with virtue, ond thought that vice was incrusted by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the fcene, as we see in the mandes: he thought that the misery of a cottage was conjured up in the garment, which were also warm, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and the stains of various colors. He thought, In sine, that the dreams of the poles were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when entering the gay circles, many mothers surrounded the babes, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or blushing fovorites: at the same time, by their dazzling faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he was working his lips, he soon led him as noticians of his talcs and his merits. Attached as he was to the kingnance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find, that, except in tallows and wax candles that darted, not from the presenco af a ghost, but from snvffing jerk, there was no foundation in truth for ari of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Discovering, how, some compensation in the vanity gratis ied, he was about to requisition his dreams, when the oxtraordjnary beingwe baue above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it, and the impossible to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs to his observation of the Exlerian objects, that the taclt consent to existence thoir, implied by the avoidance of their contacl: allowing his imaginatjon to imagine all that flattered his propensity to the oxtravagclnt ideas, he soon formed this object in her0 0f a romance, and determined to observe tbe osfspring of hls floy, rather dhon the person in front of him. Hc has become familiar with him, has paid him contributions, and so far has advanced in his opinion, that his presence was still recognized. He learned grudgingly that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, arid, quickly found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was preparing for a trauel. Desirouf obtained some information respeetjng thjs singular choracter, which, until now, had only brandished his curjosity, he suggested to his guardians, thclt it was timc for him to perform tbe turn, which so much generalis has been tugt neccsssary lo allow young tbe to lactate a few rapid steps in the career of vice towards putjng themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not allow to the in to appeor as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned the subjects of acceptable or praise, accordirig to the degree 0f competence that he had in the pursuit of these ones. They consent: and Aubrey immediately mentioning bis intentionioris to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by svch a mark of esteem of bim, which apparently had riots in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few months they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity of stvdying the character of Lord Rvthveri, ond now he faurid, that, although many moro of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions of the apparent motives to his conduct. His oompanion was profuse in promiscuousness bis; — idleness, vagabond, and heggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. Bul Aubroy did not hesitate to point out that it was not on the virtuouf, reduced to indignation by misfortunes, that he even granted to virtue, that he granted to hjs alms; — they were serious of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profigué came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Bim to tarnish his lust, or to sink it deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, h0wever, attributed by bim to the greater importurity 0f the vicious, which usually outweighs the rotating frenzy of the virtuous needy. Thero was ono circumstance about the chassary of his Lordship, who was even more impressed on his mind: grip those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, for they were all led to the scafsold, or funk to the bassel and the most abiecl misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought centres of all the fascinoble vice; there he entered into the whole spirit to the fayo tab1e: he hated, and always glittered with success, excopt wbere the known sbarper was his antagonist, arid then to be lost always more thari than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally wate the society around: it was nol, Howcver, so when he encountered the Yovthful novice eruption, to fatber him without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune - this apparent abstraction of the spirit was oside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle of Tbe, he smelled, cursed, in the loneliness of a durigeon, the fate that had attracted hlm to the reach of this fiend; while mary a father sat frantic, ainidst the talking appearance of intel hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where with t0 buy even enough to satisfy their desire for presertity. Yet he did not take money from the tab of play1e; but immediatly lost, to the ruiner of my ny, the last guilder he had just pulled out of the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bulb is the result of a degree of certclin knowledge, which was not, rainbow, occlusable to fight against the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey oftcn wanted to represent this Lo Hif friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit; — but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, he never happened. The Lord Ruthven in the carriage bis, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of birth, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the ohject of his curiosity, he obtained no more grcltification than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some superriatural thiorig.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his c0mpanion; he threw it every day in the presence of a Countess of Italjan on the morning circle, while he went in search of the memorials of the anoteric, the most deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he impatiently worked; the first came from his sister, opening nothing but affection; the 0thors were of his guardians, the latter stupefied him; if he had come from his imagination thero waf an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guard instilled in his friend, arid, that his carousel was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. He had discovered, that bis cantempter sor adultery had not stirred up in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratistiori, that bis victim, the associate of his guilt, sho veled srom the pinriacle of the non-sulliode virtue, dowri at the lowest hyssée of infamy and degradation: in f e, that all the femoles which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown aside the mask from the side, and had not burned to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the wbose character had not yet sbowri a single luminous point on which to rest tho eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposirig, in the sense that, to look at it more cosely, arid lo does not let pass any slight non-notjced circumstance. He entered the same circle, and immediately perceived, his Lordship was eridvorous lo w0rk on the inexperience of the lady's daughter of whom he frequented the chief house. In Italy, it is feldom that the woman ari uninarried meets in society; he was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Auhrey'f looks at the follow-up in its windings, and s0on discovered shot a bad donkey was namedcd, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Losing the hour, he entered L0rd Ruthven's apartment, clinging abruptly to ask him for his intentionf with respoct your tbe lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to inoculate him that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that all the wovlds had such an ocoasis; and after being rushed to marry him, he laughed joyfully. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately by writing a note, to say, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the romander of their extended visit, he rd bis servant to look for other apartments, and call the mother of the lady, informed ber of all that he knew, not only with regard to his davghter, hut cllso conoering the oharacter of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to notify his oomplctc consenting to a separation; bul caused a riot any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nHoving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greee, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his solidity in the house of o Greek; arid soon took care to trace the faded records of ancjent gary on the monumerits which, apparently, ashclined to chronicle the acts of the free only before the slaves, had hidden tbemselv es under self1 sheltering or mary c0lavred lichen. Under the sunken roof like himself, there existed a being, so heavy and so criminal, that she could have formed the model of a softener wanting to p0urtrayer on canvases the promised hope of faithfuI in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have changed his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious leopic look of the adapted animcll but to the taste of the ari bone spruce. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquarians, and often would be the poisonous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly of Kashmere, show all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the euger gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on ari almost eclipsed, in the contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, the lresses failing, as she flirted around, expose in the ray of the sun so deliciously hrilling and quickly failing hucs, he might well excuse the oblivuInefs of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why try to decipher the charms that everyone feels, but that no ean appreciates?—It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being hit by crowded drawing rooms and Stifilirig balls. As he drew these remains of wbich, he wanted to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, and searched the magical effects of his pericll, tracing the scenes of his nalive place; she would describe to him the circumling dariceupon the open peain, wauld painting, to him in all the brilliant colors of yout hful motherry, the wedding pump that she remembered to look at in young age; and then, turnnirig to sub-jeets who had obviously made a greater iinpression on her reindeer, would tell bim ail the suprematural tales of her nanny. Her curiosity and her apparent belief in what she tells exudes the very interest of Aubrey; arid often as she told her the story of the living vampyr, which had spent years among her friends, arid dea-\nthe bonds of rest, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful female prolong her exile in the following months, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at him with so many idle arid fantasies; the hut Ianlhe quoted to awaken the names of the old men, who had elected to Iast a man living among them1ves, after many of their close rclatives and children had been marked with the tho stamp of the called fiend; and that she had found him so unbelievable, sho begged of him to believe it, for he had been, pointed out, thal those who dared to question exjftence, had always had evidence, who 0bliged them, with pain and hearing to tear, to confess that it was true. She gave him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror is magnified, hearing a precise prelty disillusionment of Lord Ruthven; however, he still took to persuade hor, that there could be no truth in his fears, although al the sarcastic lime that he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthven's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling to himself morch and even more to Ianthe; his innocence, so recruited from all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought to see love, gained his heart; and while laughing at the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, he found that he...\nElf more and more attached to the almost magical sorm before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for s0me antiquarian refearch, he deptclrt, dlermined not to return until the object hjs was reached; bvt he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him,whjlst in his mind, he removed the ari image which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of love bis, and was still the same child he had known for the first time. She seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she had rioed more than one with whom she could visit the fovorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or infiltrating a fragment that bad but evacuated the destructive hand af time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they bots, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to prooeder on an af his excursions, which had to detairi hjm for a few hours; when they heard the nclme of the place, they all at the same time begged not to come back at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, clftcr the day had closed, on any c0nsideration. They described it cls the station of vampyres iri tbeir rioctoturnal orgios, and denounced the most ugly evils as imminent on hiin wbo dored to crosf their way. Auhrey made the light of the representations of lbeir, arid tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring thuf lo mocking a superior, infernal power, the very name of whooh opparenly frecze their blood, he was sj1ent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for vpan hjs without participation; he was surprised to get melancholy in front of his host, and was confounded to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fiends, had inspired them with the terror of svch. When he was about to break off, Ianthe came to the side of the horse, and begged him to return, and he allowed the power of the bclngs of lheso to be put into an aetion;—he promised. However, he was so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day of Tbat was about to end, and tbat on the horizon there was the orie of these speoks which, in warmer climates, so quickly gathhor in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country.—He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined t0 compensate the speed of his delay: bul it was late. Twilight, in this support-\nThe climate is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins; and the dawn has progressed, for the storm's power was above — its thunders were scarcely resting — its thick roaring forced its way around the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Svddenly his horsc got scared, and he was carrified with the terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through satiguo, stopp ed, and it sounds, by the brilliance of lightning, tbat it was in the vicinity 0f a houel which hord1y rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood wbich surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a guide of 1 t0 hlm to the city, or at least trust to shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the tho drea.\nof a woman mingling with suffocating mockery, exulting with a lavgh, continued in an almost intact sound; — he was surprised: bvt, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his hcad, he, with a blow of force, forced the door of the hvt. Ho found himself in the darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remark was made hiin. He found himself in a contaot some 0ne, which he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out: \"Agaln turned down!\" to which a great laugb suoceed; and ho folt hirnself hacked by a wh0se force seemed superhum an: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uan: he was lifted from his feet and thrown with enormous force against the ground: — his enemy threw him so on him, and knelt on his chest, had placed his hands bis on his throat—when the glory of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly roused, and, leaving his prey, pressed the door, and in a mother the crushing of his branches, as he broke the w0od, was more heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, who was moving, was soon heard by those who had none. Tbey entered, the lethargy of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the charge of tbatch on each straw with soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought the ber who had drawn the bim with his cries; he was again in the darkness; 6but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, for the airy percelvetbe form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corse of life1. He was beating his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same shape, which he did not close, extended by the side of hls. There was no colour on his cheek, no riots even on his lip; however, there was a mortilege on his face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, orid on his throat were the marker of the leeches that were on his vein: — to this men pointed, wept, struck at the same time with horror, \"In Vampyre! a Vampyrc!\" A litter was formed quickly, and Aubrey was placed next to her who had recently blessed him with the 0b of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of lily that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and had fun running away from reflection, and taking refuge in the vacancy, he held a naked dagger of a particular construction in his hand, which had sounded in the cabin. They were so numerous with djfferent por-\ntief who had engaged in the mercb of her that the mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, approaching the city, told the parents a terrible catastrophe. \"That it would be impossible to describe the grif of Tbeir; but when he determined the cause of the death of their evild, they looked at al-Aubrey, clinging to the Corsican. They were inc0nsolabIc; Hoth died in broken heart.\nAuhrey being put to bed had a violent foam fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he could appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe – by the same incomprehensible combination that he seemed to be begging his fragrant companion to wear the being he loved. At other times, he was iestimating the maldictions on the head of hjs, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance to arrive in Athens, and, from any moljve, after hearing about the state of Aubr ey, immediately placed iri the same house, and became his constant assistant. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyro; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost rccpenlance for the fault that had caused their separton, and stilI moro by the attention, anxiety, arid care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence of hjs. Hls Lordshjp seemed quite changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so surprised Au6rey; but as soon as his convaIcenoe ganized to be quick, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Auhrey perccida no difference with the former man, except that at once he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this fmilo haunted him. During the first stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently engaged in the fight against the tideless waves raised by the coo1ing,0r jn rnarking tho progress of these orbs, circljng, like the 0ur world, the still svn;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's inirid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that once bad s0 distinguished bim now seemed to have fled forever. He was as fond of solitvde and silence as Lord Ruthven; but he wanted a lot of solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he once frequented, Ianthe's shape stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly, turrifying r0und, wouid sh ow, with his wild imagination, his pale and thral-injured face, with a gentle smile on his lips. He has determined to steal scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they scrambled those parts 0f Greee and had not yet seen. They travel in all directions, and soughl each place to which a memory could be attached: 6 But although they hastened to go from the room to the room, he did not seem to take into account the whale they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined as the invention of the different, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of tbose that they drew from the preluded dangers. As a result of this neglect jng the advjce of the inhabitants, ori ori occasion they have worked with only a few guards, more to serve you as guides than to defend. On the training, Howevor, a narrow desile, to tbc boulom de whjch was the bed o o torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from laneigbbouring prccipices, they bad reason to repent lheir negligent; for almost all the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were scattered by the whist ljng of olose bvllets at their head, attached by the ratio echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behirid rocks, had begun to fire in the origin of the Camc report. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitatlng their example, withdrew for a moment behind the lurri sheltering from dcfile tbe: but shameful of beirig thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries made them advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, is ony thieves should fall over and lace them in the back, they decided both t0 to rush forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the cock, when Lard Ruthven received a foam in his shoulder, which led him to the impound. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistantarioe; the clnd, who no longer takes account of the ephemeral or peril, is quickly surprised when he sees the faoes of the rabbis around the hjm — his guards who, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promising a great reward, Auhrey soon encouraged Tbern to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and, having agreed to snoring, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they simply trained the entrance until their comrade retum with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; ho seemed as unconscious of the pain he had been of thc objects about him: 6ut towards the end of the last evcnirig, his inind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Auhrey, who was led to offer his help with more than the usual seriousness—\"Help me! You can save me—you can do more than that—I do not mean my Ijfe, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as tbat of the past day; but you can drunken my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need, but little of my life, I can't explain the whole thing, but if you hide everything you know from me, honor was spotless in the mouth of the world, and was my death unknown for some time in England, me, but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give any knowledge of my crimes or of my death to your living bcirig in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you may see.\" \"His eyes seemed six-fold from their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrcy; he was laughing at his pill0w, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at the knowledge of this man arose from his inind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his 0ath, a cold chill came upon him, as it is of the presentation of something horrible waiting for bim. Rjsing early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body of Tbe, when a rohber met him, and irritated him that there was no tbere l0nger, having transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promife they had giuen his seigneury, that he could have been exposed to the radius of call firft of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey deafened himself and took several of the meri, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he did not find any traoe of the clothes c0rpse or lhe, lhovgh the thieves swore that they indicated the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was perplexed jn conjectures, bvt hc at the tip came back, convinced that Ihey had buried the corpse to the socée of clothes.\nWeary of a country in the whip, he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in whoh allappclrent1y conspired to increase that superstitious melancholic thal had taken up his mind upori, ho resolved to Leaueit, and so0n arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naples, is busy organizing the effects that it had with it belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case containing felonyweaporis, more or less one baptized to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. While returning and examining their curious for ms, what was bis surprise to find a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to get more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can he imagine when hc discovered that he was equipping, in particular shape, lhesheath that he held in his harid. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at lo bouride at the dagger; but ho still wanted not to believe; but the particulate form, the varying shades of the samo on the haft and the sheath were similar in the splendov on both, and leaves no doubt sor; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on the way home, in Rome, the first investigations were about the lady he had tried to remove Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in difference, their fortune ruined, and she had not been a hero since the departure of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady might have fallen victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became m0r0se and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if one were going to save the reading of someone considered expensive. He came to Calclis; a breeze, wbich seemed abdient to his will, soon to be cast brown to the English sbores; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, arid tbere, for a soothing, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she had before, hy her infantile ears, gained her effect, now that the woman began to operate, she was even more endearing as a companjon.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid applause of the salon donkey. There was no light af but brilljanoy that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was lit by the piousness of the mind below. There was a melancholy on this subject which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul o o more brilliant kingdom. His step was nat that the light foot jng, wjch wandering where to er a butterfly or color can attract—it was sedative and pensive. When Alono, his face was bewildered by the breath of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection for him, and in his presence, those deed tried to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged it with that of the volcano? It seemed that these eyes—that dace were then playediririg in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, having believed by her guardians more fit than her taking should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, when he would be his protector. So it was now decided that the next salon, Whib, should approach quickly, should be the epoh of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey was going to fight in his father's house, arid was tired of the melancholy that surpassed him. Ho could not feel interested in the frivolities of fafhionnable strangers, when his mind was so torn by the events he had seen; bvt he decided to sacrifice his elder to the protection of his sisler. They soon came to the city, and prepared for it the next day, which was announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a n0t parlor had been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to bask jn RoyaTy's smile, hastened to do so. Aubrey was there with his sisler. As he stood at a corner by hjm myself, without taking into account all that was around him, he plunged into the memory of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvcn in that place, he suddenly felt seized by the elm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear – \"Remember your ocllb.\" He had little to turn, afraid of seeing a specter that would blow him up, that he had pierced, at a distance from litllo, the same figure wbich had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members refused the most to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and passing through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He paoed the room with horrjed steps, and fixed his bands on the hif head, as if he feared that his thoughts would explode from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him — circumstances began in a picture of horror — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up hlmself, he could not believe that it was possible — death rose again! — He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was turning. It was impossible that it could be real — so he delrminated, to go back into the socjety; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the riarne hung on the lips bis, and he could not succeed in obtaining the jnformation. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he withdrew into a corner, and there gave himself to his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that he was raining a lot of werc, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by many, tame in a well-deserved conversation; he was tempted to pass and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed these hc features to him the most hbhorrod. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a furious march, forced her to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the eruption of the servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was passing by, he heard this voice murmuring with him again: «Remember your oath!»\"He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey's almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, h0w much more completely was he absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thovghts. Her sister's attention was now vnhecded, arid it was in vain that she asked her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and Thoso terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him;—did ho then allow this monster to roam, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His fisher even could have been touchod by hjm. But never, if he broke his oats, and revealed his suspicions, what would believe it? He used his own hand to exterminate the world from such misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and he only went when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged the hive, for his own good, to beg nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. Her dress has become neglected, and be wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned in the evening; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue prevented him. His sjster, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow hjm; but thoy soon became distracted by him who fled from a faster pursuer Ihan anything—of his own. His conduct, however,\nI've changed. Struck wjth the idea that he left by his absencc all his friends, with a madman among them, whose presencc they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite hjs 0ath, all that Lord Ruthven learned with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his baggard and his suspicious eyes were so dizzying, his inner pitfalls were visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for abstinence Ain to seek, for his false, a society that so strongly affected him. Wheri, however, resurrclnc turned out to be unwarranted, the guardians thought appropriate to interpose, and, fearing that his mind wos would become alienated, lhey thought that he timo raised to regain the trust that had previously been imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesiring to save him from the insult and asphyxiation that he had experienced in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing these marks of what they could do insanity to the gonceral eye, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so that competently his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His intelligence finally became so great, that he was confined to his cbambre. He often lies for little ones, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of apseclion and memory that remained appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with gravely distressed thoristic eyes, he wanted her not touchb. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love has come to me, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked wh0m hc reserred, her only answer was: \"True! True!\" and agajn he has sarik in a state, from which she could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his bccame iricoherences less frequent, and his mind threw a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day, he counted on his fingers a numbor definitc, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his physicicicicln about the mclancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in such a heinous situation, when his fisher was going ncxt day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, for fear that it was fallen, lhey mentioned the dwarf os thc Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count he had in company with mel in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and stunned them still with mare by expressing his intention to be present at nuptjals, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his beautiful snile; for he pressed his chest hcr t0, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother enlivening himself once again to feelings of offending. He began to speak with all his heat gained, and to c0ngratulate it on his marjage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced o lockel upan his chest; opening, wbal was his fury to look at the characteristics of the monster who had if l0ng influenced his lifo. He captured the portrait in a pclroxysm of rogo, and trampled it under the imbecile. On her asking him why he destroyed the resemblance of the future husband, he loakedas if he did not understand the ber, then took hold of his hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of the face, he told swcar that she would never marry Tbis monstor, because he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice resumed his oath — he suddenly turned1y, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guardians and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return of her disorder, entered and pushed him from Miss Aubrey, desired that she abandon him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and begged them to delay the cabin for a day. They attached this to the inseparity that they iinaginized had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the mornirig after the drawing room, and had been refuted with every olse. When he heard of Aubrey's infirmity, he realized that his sons were the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultatjon and his plea could be gagged from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former companion, and, by constarit attendanoe, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His language presents dangers that one can tell: one could speak of himself as an ari individual who has no sympathy for a being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself; one could say how, since he knew her, her existence, seemed worthy of conservation, if it was not simply that he could listen to her soothing. In the end, he knew so well how to use the art of Tbe's snake, or svch was the will of destiny, that he ruined his affection.\nNs. The title of the older branch falling to it in length, he obtained ari important embasfy, which was striving like an ox to hasten the marriage, (in fpjte of the disturbed state of his brother,) which was to take place lbe the day before his departure for the thc cantjnt.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and his guards, tried to 6ribe the serrants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those n0w in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he gave the heaviest curvature. The servants promised that they would delude him; but givjng to the doctor, it is better that he no longer harass the spirit of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, tbc ravings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the busy irimatef of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that one could more easily conceive thari described, the notes of occupied preporation. Mornirig came, and the Surah of the cars broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of a woman ari hclplessold. He took advantage of the opportunity, with a dog was outside af TBC room, and in a momont found hiinfelf in the apartment where all were noarly assombled. The Lord Ruthven was the greatest man who prepared him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by the farce, he rushed out of the ridge, furiously moving away. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear on the shelf: \"Remember your oalh, and know, is not my bride in the daytime, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" And he said, He hath put him in search of his servants, what has the old woman awoke? Aubrey could no longer pleaseporthim himself; his rage riots find vent, had broken o blood-vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to sister bis, who was not present when he prayed, as the doctor was afraid to agitate him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and husband Lefl London.\nAubrey's weak nodes are increasing; bloodshed produces symptoms of the approach close to dealh. He wanted his sister's guardians to be calm, and when midnight had struck, he told what the reader had perpetuated: he died afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Misf Aubrey; but if they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubre...\nThe sister of you had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, whore t0 choose his place of resl, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN 1812, we placed in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The height of this place, and the poisoning of some frozen vegetables still to be found, lead many British ships to visit it — bollh meri de guerre and mermeri; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrria, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the cattle bag merchant with the laughs, the clergyman and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had before bcen. On the br0w of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and hired a young Greek like our guidance, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before we arrived in his felucca. \"He hired Mc as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld took me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where Iam 1ikely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river Tbe, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dorninick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins for her, (about Lz50 Curreney English,) and rucked on the four teri rnonths, but not constantly; for to be sailing in his felucca very often to the islands diferate.\"\nThis account excited ovr curi0sity vory a lot, and we did not lose timc iri hastenlrig where our compatriot had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply docure: green wall plairi, marble tables on the ejther side, a large myrtlo in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a sprjng fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posturojng; a large cuch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: lrc were not mirrors, nor a single point. The bedroom has mercly a large sprecld mattress on tbe flaor, with two cotton stuffed qujlts arid a pillow — the common bed thrugbout Greece. In the living room, we ohsorvod a recos of marble, peasant, the old man told us, bloody with books and papers, which were tbon in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it waf open, but we do not think noseeues justified in exominjng the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, B0ileau and Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmermori, in the German longuage; the Messla of Klopstack; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller's Rob6ers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, prayed to Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the album. The Greek press in Constantinop1e, very torn, but no English book of any degradation. Most of these b0oks were filled with margnal noles, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with papal leaves, on which cllso were remarks.\nThe old man of Tho said: \"Tobe lord had 6th reading these books before being sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bul, he said, they must there 1st until his return; for it is so special, that I had to move a lhing without order, hc would frown me for a week together; hc is otherwise very good. I have done him a service, and I have the product of this farm for the pain she has taken, except twenty zechins wbicb which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The frantic p ortico was fifty steps lorig and fourteeri wide, on the canned marble pillars with plinths bla ck and freight-w0rk cornices, (as it is now oustomary in Greciari architecture,) werc considerably higher than the raof. The roof, surrounded by a light stamen balustrade, was surrounded by a cclrpet of sinus turkey, under a rough slrong flax awning. Most of the aro top houses thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, drinking light wines, svch like \"lachryma christi,\" eallrig fruits, and enj0ying the evening breeze.\nIn the left hand, as we entered the house, a stream of sma1l glissa, pomegranates, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, hanging in the shade of large bushes of myrlle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he prayed, for he was very fervent, arid, always attended our Twioe church for a week, in addition to Svndays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird view.\" A moon of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive trees and myrles in bloom, arid ori the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream emitting fr0m the ruins descend in cascades of brokcn, until it is lost iri the wood ncar the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the horizon not overshadowed by a slngle cloud, tarnished life in front; and a little to the left, through a visla of hazelnuts and lofly palm trees, small islets were observed distinctly, spreading the light wavy blue with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in his romantic solitude: no one knew his name but D0minick, his bariker, who had gone to Candia. \"Tho Armani,\" said our leader, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't,\"\"And can't you say it, old friend?\"I said, \"if I can,\" said hc, \"I don't dare.\" We don't have much time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned the seclusion details of the secluded lord. He had worn eight young girls when he spent the last night on the Jsland, and even danced with him at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, borsos to others, and cotton and silk to the gjrls who live by weaving articles of lhesc. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own in a storm, and was often gaued G reek Teslaments to poor children. In short, it seems to us, of all that we have called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we laud, which our old friend at the cottagc considered appropriate not to disclose. He has a very beautiful daughter, whom the Lord often saw walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bougbt to him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of jt.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations or the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was evjderit: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those ecc ertricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who was travelinglirig to Egypt on Greeco, \"The indjvidual,\" he said, \"about whom yav are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never had the fame of his seigneury at that time, and had been the same years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclus of Calcia in every page. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curious in our researohes at the side, but we have become corisolated to the idea of returning to Mitylene on any day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statemont, by improving it not entirely uninteresting, and in justice the good name of lo bis Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its punishments, or to add its pleas. The fact is terribly the opposite, as it can clearly gather from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so gloriously represented in the pooms of his seigneury, see to havc their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and tenacity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that marks him as a being whose heart ReIigion sealed, and On whose head Benevolence cast her coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"laughters\" without feeling proud of him. As far as his rents or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports must be received with caution, with brilliance when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; arid he wbo dclres himself justifies in front of this terrible court where all the mufts appear, only can censor the errors of the other-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of virulent beauty and self-approved consequence.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "45": "VAMPYRE;\nA Tclle.\nBy John Wi1liam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based is very geriatric in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be emmorial: it did not extend the Greeks until after the establishment of the Cbristianity; and it did not assail its present form sjence the division 0f the Latin and Greek churches; to which timo, the idea of becoming preva1enl, that a Lat in the body could not corrupt so buried in the territory of the Ihère, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, extinct stjl1, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the y0ung and beautiful. In the West, he spread, with some variation of view, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, that there existed the belief, the thal vampyre soaked a cortain part of the blood of the victims, who emancipated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these human blood suckers were greasing — and their veins became distendcd lo such o slate of the repletion, in order to cause the blood of all the cages of all the bodies to fall, and everi from the same porefos their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, whjch is status of having occvred in Madreyga, Hungary. He oppears, thal upan an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magjstrats of the place, they affirmed positively arid unanimously, tbat, about fivc years before, a certain Hey-\nDuke, nclmed Arnold Paul, hcld was heard at soy, that in Cassova, at the borders of the Tv rkifh Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating from the orne on earth the grave of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautlon, however, does not prevent hlrn from scorning a varnpyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days astride his death and burial, many people complained of havjng were tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people were deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent the furtbermousse, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (sis pleased to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emulating with mauth, nose, and ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was thus erased, they resorted to an ausualized remedy. Attack was pushed erirely throvgh tbe heart and Arnold Paul's body, where he would have shouted as terribly as jf he had boen alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and tore the ashes of his grave. The same measures were adopted with corses tbe of these wbo people had previously drained vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal 6elief is, it is a person sucked by o vampyre bccomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in its turn.\nChief Baiiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is hercized, as it seems preferable to illustrate the subjecl of the observations preserit tban any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a hereditary crime committed while in cxistence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his irisernal visits only to those beings he loved most on earth — those to whom he was flouted by kinship and offense.—A suppositlon alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from the tomb of them; and then the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy race; from thence of the daughter Ly, sister, wife, midnight drain the flow of life; yet forget the banquet which must feed by Livid Livjng Corsica, Your vltims, are still exhaled, They will know the devil for their sirc; As the cursed tbce, thou cursed them, Thy flowers wilt wilt on the stem. But the one who for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best loved of all, Shal1 blcs thee with the name of a false—This word Shail envelops your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the lasl tingc of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the glazed laft look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; Thcn with his bare hand will tear the lresses of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a scarf padlock The most diligent help of affection is carried by lhee Momorial of your agony! But with your own best blood will drape; your nibble lobes and your harging lip; then, tracking your tomb sullcn, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors iri depart from the spectre more secure than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in bis wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arabic Oneizcl, wbo is presented as hauer relurned detbe falls in order to torment the fhc better loved while being in existence. Bul lhis cannot be assumed to have been the result of the sinfulness of his life, sbe being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. Tovrnefort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great upori work this subject, besides cl varjety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to show that he is a classiccll, as well as barbarial error.\nAlthough the term Vampyre may suffice for the limits of the note, neo-testically devoted to explanition, and which can now be concluded by simply curling up, although the term Vampyre is that in the general acceptance, there are several olhers synonymous with it, the insane use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, several parties of the leaders of the ton appeared a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, tban his rank. He looked at the mirlh around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, which he drenched by a lo0k crush him, and threw a feud into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who seal this sensitivity of fear, cannot explain from where it rises: some attribute it to the dead grey eye, whicb, staring on the face of the object, do not seem to penetrate, arid to a single glance to pierce through the interior works inside the heart; but fall upwards the cheek wjtb a ray of lead that wigd on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities have caused him. He invited to every h0use; all wanted to see him, and tbose who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt weigbt of boredom, were happy to amass fomething in their capclble prcsence to engage their attention. Despite the deadly dizziness of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, eilber of the blush of modesty, or the strong emotion of the passlon, although her forrn and contour were 6eautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to win her attenlions, and gained, at least, whclt care marks that they might call affétion: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of euery m0nster shewn iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in bis manner, and did anything but put on the dress of a movntobank, to take into account her opinion:—although in uan:—when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on hcr's, it still seemed that they were not understood;—even her unapplied impudence was 6 affluished, on her left the field. Although common adultery could not affect even the greed of his eyes, there was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet sucb was the apparent cavtlon with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, some knew that he was speaking to women. However, he has the reputation of a winning language; and although he has overcome it even from the fear of his singular character, ar tbat they have been movod by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among those women who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic vjrtues, as amang those who push him by their vices.\nAb0vt the same tjme, there camc in London a young geritleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great wea1th, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lcft also to himself by the guards, wbo thought it was their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they gave up the greater burden of his mind to the custody of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated inor his imagination than his judgment. He had, John, this high romantic feeling of honaur and candor, which daily rijns so many apprentices of thousand. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and to say that vice was flouted by Providence only1y for the pictogram effect of the sccne, as we see from the inromances: either that the misery of a cottage was simply iri the uesting of the olothes, wbich were as hot, but that we adapted better to the eyo of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was handsomc, frank, and ricb: for these rcasons, on his inheritance in gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth their favourites languishlng or grumpy: the girls clinged to the same lime, by their briddlening countenancics when he approached, on the eyes sporkling, when one opened his lips, soon brought bim in false note of his talents and his meril. Attached af he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find, that, with the exception of the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, rioting of the presence of a ghost, but of the snuffing canaille, there was no furnace in the life of reaI for none of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these voluines, brake that he had formed his study. Findjng, however, somo compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up the dreams bis, when it is extraordinary that we abovo described, went through it in his career.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an ldea of tbe character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of observation hift of external objects, thari the tacit attachment to their existence, imitated by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his lmagination to imagine a thing evoked that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of romance cl, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has gone ahead with his opinion, which his presence wos has always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rvthven's affairs were seized, quickly found, from the node of preparation in—Slr-\nAnd that he was about to get to Iravol. Desiring to give a little information about the singularity of the tbis, which, now, had only to stifle his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to make a visit of tbe, which for many generations was considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the care of vice to put vpori an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to ap peclr as if fallen from the sky, whenever scaridalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill they bring to listen to them. And Aubrey unequivocally evoking his intentions t0 Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a propofale to join the hjm. Flattened by svch a mark of esteem of Hiin, who apparently had nothing in common wilh olher men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found, that, a thousand more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the refuIt has offered different conclusions of the apparent reasons for his conduct. His companjon was abundant in his liberality;—the vagrant, the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid making remarks, tal he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by tho malfortvnes atteridating even a virtue, tbat he granted his alms; — these were sent out of the door with barely repressed fneers; but when the profligclte came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even more into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed to the greatest impossibility of vicariousness, which generally outweighs the retirement of virtuous indigents. There were important circumstances concerning the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: every tip on which he was raised, inevitably sounded that there was a curse on her, for they were all either at the foam, or sunk to the law and the most abect mifery. In Brussels and in the cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the ardour with which his companion sought the centres of all fusbionnable vices; he entered there in all the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always won successfully, except where the best known was his antag0rist, and then he lost evcn more than he had won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with the hand that he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a large family; then his very desire seized the law of Fortvne — this apparent abstraction of mjnd was laid asidc, and his eyes shimmered with more fircil than that of eating while deliring with the mouse half dead. In every city, he left the old tributary...\nThe youth, torn from the circus which he has adorned, cursed, in the selfitude of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him to the reach of this fiend; while mony o father sot fritic, in the midst of a tbe speaking of the gazes of a mute hungry child, without anything far from hjs later immense wealth, wbererwith to buy even susfjcient to satisfy their present desire. Yot he took n0 silver srom tbe table of play; hut immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last guilder he just pulled out of the convulsive grip of the innocent: this mlgbt hits the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, possible to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wished to present him to his friend, and begged him to sign this charity an arid pleasure which caused the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit;—but he delayed—for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in the carriage, and in the midst of various wild scenes and rich in nostrils, was always the same: bisoeil spoke less than his ljp; and although Avbrey was near the object of his cvriosjty, he did not get any more gratificotion from him thari the constant excitement of wanting vainly to remove this mystery, which to his cxalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon clinged to Rome, attaching Aubrey to a lost time of his companiori; he left bim in daily joy on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in fear of the memorols of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which was striving impatiently; the sirst came from his sister, breathing only from the afaction; the others were fram his guardians, the latter stifled him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was a bad power in his companion.\nef. His guards insisted that he immediately left his bif friend, and urged that his character be terribly vicious, for this passing of irresistible power of seduction made his fiery habits more dangerous for society. He had discovered, that his coritempt for adultery had rioted in the hatred of his character; but that he had acquired, in order to strengthen his gratification, that bls viotirn, the associate of his guilt, had to be thrown from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females that had been sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, from his sorbre, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of the irreversibility to the public gaze.\nAubrey decimated by leaving one, whate chclracter had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a pretext of plausihle in order to abandon him completely, in order, in the sense, to monitor him more closely, and not to let any dark circumstance pass 6y unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, arid soon peroeived, that his seigneury was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he chicfly frequered. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to meet in society; hc was therefore forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him throughout his similif, and soon discovered that an assjgnation hod was named, which would end up iikely in the ruin of an innocent girl, though unimaginable. Losjng did not have time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his hints with respect to the Icldy, informing him in the hour tho sarne that he was aware of his obstinacy to meet his tbat the same night. Lord Ruthven answe...\nof such an opportunity, and after having been in a hurry to find out whether he intended to marry him, he was content to laugh. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this mountain he had to docline accommodate his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit of Tbeir, he ordered his servant to seek further talk, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, bul also about the character of his Lordship. The Assjnation was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to notify you of complete consent to a separation; bvt n0t suggested any suspicion 0f his plans haujng were smeared by the interpositori of Avbrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey headed for Greece and crossed the Pcninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. Ho then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of traoing the documentsfaded of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful or chronic the acts of free men only before slaves, hcld hidden themesselvcs under the sheltering ground or many colorful llchen. Under the same r0 of himself, exified a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she had formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mohammed, except that his eyes spoke too nruch mirid so that someone might think that he might be among tbose who has no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the inuntain, the gazelle would have been thought of a poor lype of hor casties; for wbo would have exochanged his eye, apparent1y the eye of the animated riature, so that the luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. Tbe light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for the antjquities, and often he would be a girl unconscjous, engaged in the pursuit 0f a Kasbmere butterfly, show all the beauty of its shape, floating as it was on the wind, to the eagcr look of hlm, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylph style sjgure. Often, her braids fell, while she was wilting, exhibited in the ray of the sun, delicate1y brilliantly and quickly1y discoloring the hues, he mihil wcil excuses the oblivion of the anliquary, which let escape the mind of hjs the very object that it had been considered vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in the Pavsanias. But why try typing charms that everyone feels, but laugh can learn?—It was innocent, youtb, clnd beauty, without being affected by crowded drawers--\nNg-rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew these remajns of whlcb that he wanted to keep the amorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe to him the clrcling dclnco on the plain of the apen, painted, to him in others the brilliant lovers of youthful memory, the mclrrage pomp sbe remembered having seen in his infarction; and then, of course, tvrning to the thclt subjects had made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supermatural tales of the Hor nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she was telling, exclaimed the very interest of Aubrey; often as a sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which he had spent years in the midst of his amif, and the dear bonds, appeared every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful female to prolong bis existing once for tbe the sniffs that followed, his blood rolled, that he had had the warmest to laugh at such an idea and horrible fantasios; but Ionthe quoted to him the nomos of the old men, whom he had finally detected 0ne living am0 themselves, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of fiend; and when she found him so unbelievable, she begged to believe it, for it had been noticed that those who had dared to exterminate their existence, had always had evidence, wbich oh, with cries and strokes of heart, with true cries. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these walruses, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description af Lord Ruthuen; however, he still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her feet, although at the same time he wondered about several coincidences that had all feared exciating a belief in supernatural power af Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so congratulated by all the virtues affected by the woman among wham, he had sought his romantic visiane, won his beort; and while he was rjdiculating the idea of a y0ung of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he sounded more and more attached to one of the furiousest before stopping. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plcln for some anti-qvarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his object had been reached; but he found it impossible to fix his attrition upwards the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the sole owner of his thoughts rights. Ianthe waf unconscious of his love, and has always been the frank childish sarne that he had first known. She always separated herself from him with the reluctanee; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom shc could visit her favovrite hclurits, what1sl her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had still wiped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vclmpyres, and both, with the present coveral, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the name of Uery. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey determined to proceed to the orie of his cxcvries, which was to hold him for a few hours; when TBey heard the name of the place, they all at the same time begged him not to return at night, as he must pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had closed, until any consideration. They dethroned it as the station of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Auhrey made the light of their representations, and dragged them to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at hjs thus daring to m0ck a superior, infernal power, the very name of which he apparently made to freeze the blood tobeir, he was fi1ent.\nHe was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired this terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, and the night passed allowed to put the power of these beings into action;—he proinized. However, he was so busy in his research that he did not perceive that the daylight was going to stop, and there was on the horizon one of those wbich flies, in warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring all their rage over the devoted country.—He finally, Howcver, riding horse bis, deterred catching 6y speed for his delay: hut he was too late. The twilight, in these olimals of the south, is unknown; immediately the sun goes down, at night bogins; and it had advariated far, the power of the storm was engaged — its thunders failed had barely an interval of rest — its heavy rain forced them to go through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall encumbered radiates to its own feet. Suddenly, his horse scared, and hc was buried with a terrible rock through the tangled forest. The animal finally stopped, the fatigue stopped, and found, by the light of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof which hardly rose from the masses of dead breads arid wood that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little more than a t0 guide to the city, or at least relying on the storm's shells. As he approached, the thunders, relieved by a moment, allowed Hiin to hear the terrible cries of a mercenary who mingled with the exultant mokeria of a stifled Iaugh, convoked in a single sound of almast unbrokeri; — he marveled; but, agitated by thunder, the agajn rolled over his head, and, with a sudden effort, he forced the door of the hut. It found itself in total darkness: sound, h0wever, melted it. He was apparently not perceptive; for, although he called, the sovnds continued, and no advice was taken from him. He made contact with someone, wbom ho immediately seized; when a voice cried out: \"Again haffled!\" And he felt him, if he came up against him, whose strength was kindled with the help of supcrhurnan: he began to make himself a life as expensive as he had done, but he fought against him; but it was in vclin: he was lifted up from his feeling, irritated, hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enernia threw himself a bim, and fell on his knees on the breasts of bis, had laid his hands on his throat; when the dazzling, snare, torches penetrating into the hole that lit the day, had disturbed him; he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, arid the branches in an instant, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now stjll; and Aubrey, unable to innovate, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. A tho deslre d'Avbrey they searohod for his wbo had caught him by his screams; he was still 1ft iri darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of thc torches once again bursl Upan, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyos, hoping tbat It was a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the sarned form, when he closed them, stretched hy bis side. There was no colour on the ber oheek, no oven on his lip; yet, the thero was a face of aboulher that seemed almost as attached as the life that the orice lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, crying, at the same time struck with horror, \"A vampire! \"A vampire!\" A litter quickly formed, the arid Aubrey was the hyroid on the side of the ber who had lalely been for him the obiect of so many brilliant and fairy visions, riow falIen with the flower of life that had died with it. He did not know what his thoughts were: the bis spirit was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy; he held unconsciously almast in his hand a naked dagger of a partial consluction, which had been found in the cabin. The various parties who had been enlisted in the search for her whom a mother had missed soon met Thcy. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated him by...\nA draconian disaster. \"To describe their mourning would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child from alh, they looked at al Aubrey, arid pointcd lo oorse. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he appealed to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by a vnacoouriable combination he seemed to be begging for his former appearance to spare the being he loved. To others, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as ber destr0yer. L0rd Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Alhens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same hause, arid became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and began at the size of the bim of which he had the riow image combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, involving almost repentanco for the dirt that had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care that hc showed, saon reconciled him to his presence. Hjs seigneury seemed quite flouted; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astonjshed Aubrey; bvt as soon as his convalefcericc began to be fast, he gradually removed int0 the same state of mind, and Aubrey realized no difference with the f0rmcr inan, except that altirnes ho was surprised to meet his staring gaze, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, bvt this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid'f recavry, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in the heating of the tideless waves raised by the collision breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, circling, liko our world, motionless tho sun;—independent, he seemed to be rocking himself to steal the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elastia of the spirit that had once so distinguished him does not seem to have fled forever. He was today as lonely and silent a lover as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired, his spirit could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he had previously frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his slight step might seem wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly he turned around, he could show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, each of the characteristics that created such associations of children in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, that he had been bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they visit the parts of Greece and that they had not seen. They traveled to all regions, and sought every place to which a memory could be attached; but although they rushed from one place to another, they did not seem to be what they looked at. They hurried many robbers, but they gradually flouted these roports, which they imagined only as the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against pretentious dangers. Because of this neglect of the local councils, they have sometimes dragged with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defence. When entering, however, a riarrow desile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of bone rock descended from the neighboring precipices, he had reasons to repent of their neglect; sour scarccly were the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, that they were surprised by the whistljng 0f balls olose at their head, and by it echoed report of several weapons. In the instanl, their guards had left them arid, placing themselves bechirid rockf, had begun to draw iri the diroetion from where the rep0rt came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind him, sheltering the turning of the defilement; but, like hammocks to be thus detained, an enemy, who with lnsu1ting shouts their advarice, was exasperated to uriresjsting slaughter, if one of the thieves had to climb up and take them back, they decided both to torsob f0rward in search of theeriemy. Barely bad thoy lost shelter to the roek, when Lord Ruthven received a shot jn his shoulder, which brought him to the gr0und. Aubrey hastened to attend the bis; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having been wounded, uphill, by Lord Ruthven, immediately thrown into his arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubreysoon encouraged them to pass on wounded friend hjs to a cabjn rieighbovring; orid having accepted a snoring, he was no longer disturbed by their prefence — they were content to keep the credence until the Iheir com rade returned with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength quickly depreciated; in two days death followed, and death spread through hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had changed; he was also unconscious of the pain that he had been objocts about him: but towards the end of the evening, his mind was apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offer his clssltance with the usual tuna pond eamestnefs—\"Help me! You can love me — you can do more than that — I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I need a little bit of things — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of tho worl—and if my death stole a lot of lime in England—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying inan, raising him up with exultant violence: \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear, for cl yeclr and one day yau will not communicate to you the knowledge of my crimes or death, in any way whatsoever it happens, or of any y0u whatsoever. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he ran with a laugh of hisspice, and had no more hrcathe.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his fury, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came over him, as if fred the pre-feeling of horrible homething waitjng him. Rising early in the morning, being about to enter the coffin in which hc had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was not longcr there, having transported by himself and comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his seigneury, he should be exposed to the fjrst oold king of the Indoon who was rising after his teeth. Aubrey was surprised, and fired several of the meri, dctermj to go and bury him vpon the place where he was. But the one he had mounted found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they had revealed the idenlic rock on which they had put the body. For some time, his mind committed suicide in the conjeclvres, but he came back for the last time, convinced that they had cooked the arpisse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had inel with such terrible misfortunes, and jn whom all apparently conspired to increase that superstitious melaricholy lbat had taken in his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Wbile waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to organize the thoso effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthvcn. There was, among other things, a case of contamination of the serolic weapons of supply.\nMore or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dclggers and atagbans. While turning them back, and exomining their forms of curlov, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discussed-\nHe said that he had defiled, although in the form of a peciliclr, the sheath that he held iri his hand. His eyes began not to need further certainty — they seemed to look at 6th bound to the dagger; but he would not believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on the haft and the keatb were similar in splondour on the h-bot, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on eoch.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his unhappy home in Rom e, his first inquiries were about the lady he had tried to seize Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune rujncd, and it had not been heard since the deportation of the seigneury bis. Aubrey's spirit became the most broken alms under so many repeated horrors; he feared that the lady had been the victim of the Ianthe deslroycr. He became a morosearid son; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, cls if he were to save the Ijse bone someone he held dear. He came to Calaif; a bree2e, who began to obey his will, soon called him to take the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a rnoment, seemed to lose, iri, his sister's embraces and caresses, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more touching as companj0n.\nMiss Aubrey didn't just win whincb win the eyes and applause of the sitting room. There was no such light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded aparlmerit. His blue eye never lights up by the levity of the mind below. Therc was a slender charm on this subject which n0t seems to come from the misfortune, bvt from some feeling withiri, which appears to jndify a soul conscious of a rcalm running. His step was not thal light foot, which strays where or a butterfly ar a co1our can atlrclct—he was sedated and pensive. Alone, the smile of joy never illuminated him; but when his brother breathed his affection, arid in his presence would forget those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptvary? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of their own naliuespbere. Shc was still only a neighborhood, and had not been introduced to the world, he had 6cen thought by the guards more in shape of his presentation which could have been delayed by the return of his brother from the continent, when he reached his protector. So it was now resolved that the next show, which was approaching quickly, would be the time of its wanderinto tbe \"occupied scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the manor os hjs falhers, and fed on the melarichole that dominated bim. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable foreigners, when his mind had been so hot by the events he had intrigued; but he decided to accommodate himself with his own comfort lo lo protection af sor. They soon came into town, and prepared for the next day, which was stifled like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawer room had not held a long time, and alI what werc anxious to rest in the smile of roycllty, rushed to it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner from behind, without taking into account everything around bjm, engaged in the rembrarice lhat the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvenwos in that same place—he felt sudderileized by the arm, and a recognized hc voice too well, founded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would explode him, when he saw, a little distance away, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place on hjs firfl enlry lnto society. He looked until his limb refused the most to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to force a passage through the Erowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He hastened to stop, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—circumstances scattered away from a terrible hindrance—the dagger—his oats h.—He awakened, he could not believe that it was possible—the dead rose again!—He thought his imagination had averted the image upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real — hc decided, accordingly, to go agclin in society; for although he had tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung his lips, and he could not manage to grign the insormion. He went a few moments later with his sjster assembling a close relationship. After leaving Hor under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself to his devoring thoughts. Pcrceiving, finally, that a lot of wero leaving, he woke up, and surter another piece, found hif sister surrounded by several, appeared in the conversation of winnings; hc tried to pass and get closer to her, whori one, whom he asked in movo, turned r0urid, and revealed to him these traits he hates. And he went forth, and took his sister's arm, and set in motion, and spooked, and intercepted him toward the street; and at the door he found sons hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and when he undertook to pass through them, he heard again this voice whispering beside him, «Remember your oath!»\"He dared not dye, but, in a hurry to his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey bocaine's almost out of control. So if his mind had been absorbed by a svbjecl, how much more completely jt was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on bis teagbts. The receptions of her slster were no longer listened to, and she invited her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He only sew words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath began hlm;—was it to allow this monster to wander, to carry jng ruin over his breath, in the midst of all that he has defiled dearly, and not to avoid his progress? His sister mjght was toucbod byhim. But never, if he broke his oath, and revealed his supplications, who would believe hirn? He tenaciously empoyed his own hand to free the world struck by fubb a wretched; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For he remained in this state; locked in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sistcr came, who, with his eyes strangled with tears, begged for her your support of nature. Al ast, who is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, he has a house of 1ft hif, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal this image that flouted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the sun of the night as to midnight humidity. Hc was no longer to be recognized; ot first to be returned with the evening at home; but finally, he laid him down to rest the tiredness of the whaler overtakes him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow bim; but they were soon detached by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any—f-\nThat's what I thought. His conduct, howevcr, suddenly suffocated. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a fiend among them, of which they were preserious vnconscient, he decided to enter the jnto society again, and to look at him closedcly, anxious in advance, jn despite hif oats, all that Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and rogue eyes were so striking, shivers of interior bis so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, beyond that, the demonstration turned out to be uriuai1ing, the guards thought it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind was alienating, they thought it was high time to regain that trust that had been previously irritated by Aubrey's partners.\nDesiring to save him from the irisjurics and the sick whom he had met daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the eye these marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to esido in the hovse, and constantly take cclro of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, if completely was his mlnd absorbed by a real subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was conspired in the upper chamber. He is often lying there for days, despicable to be awake. He had been emaciated, his cyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of afsoction and memory remaining djsplayed himself at the entrance of his sister; the being would be a few to begin, and, taking hold of his hands, with Iooks who seriously afflicted him, he wished that she would not rent bim. \"Oh, touch the riots, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, she comments, she iriqvired to whom he referred, if only the answer was: \"True! True!\" And again, he sank into the state, from where she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted a lot of months: groovy, howeuer, as the year passed, his inconsistencies were less frequent to me, and his mind stirred up part of his morosity, while his obsessed guards, than sevorol time in the day he ran on his fingers a definitc nvmber, and then smiled.\nThe time has almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his gvardians entering his room, began to erupt with his doctor on the circumstantiated melancholy of Avbrey's being in a terrible situation, when his sisler will get married the next day. Instantly, Aubrey's attentist was attracted; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy is this mark of return of the intellect, whose they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name 0f the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey fell asleep, and astonished them even more by bis expressing his inlention to be present at the nuptills, and desiririg to see his sjster. They didn't answer, but iri a few mjnvtes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the inslunce of handsome smile; for he pressed her to hif brcast, and kjssed her cheek, wet of tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to the fieIirigs of the infectious. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his rank and every accomplishment; that he should suddenly be seen a medallion on his chest; that he should be opened, that he was surprised to flout the traits of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He grabs the porltrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he destr0yod thus the reseinblance of his future husband, he looked as if he djd rioted vndersstand her — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression of face, he swears to her that she would never have been able to marry this monster, because he—but he could not move forward—it seemed that this 6ade voice reminded him of his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Rulhven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who were heorizing everything, and thovghl it was only a return from his djsorder, entered, and Miss Aubrey's sorcerer, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knots to them, implored, he begged for a day's delay of t0 6ut. They attribute this to the madness they imagined having seized his mind, pacified him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven hcld callod the morning after the living room, and had been refused to want another. When he heard Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood that he was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hard hidden from thethoso from which he obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former campanion, and, through the constant presence, and the protence of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his pagan? His tongue had dangers to tell and could speak of him as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the overcrowded earth, except with the one to whom he added himself;—could say how, as he has kriew, his existence, hcld began to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not tbat he migbt listen to hor soothing accents;—in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent's entanglement, or such was the will of the fal, lhat he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fled to Iength tohim, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother,) which waf took p1ace the day before his departure for eontinent.\nAubrey, wben was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in the vajn. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; either wrote a letlcr to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated the happiness, the honor of her own, and the honor of tbose now in the grave, which once welded her in their arms as t helr bapc and the hope of their house, to delay but ill for a few hours this marriage, on which he loosened the heaviest curscs. The servants prornized Ihey would deliver it; bvt give it to the doctor, he thought it was better not to harass Mifs Aubrey hy any more, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed 0n without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that could more casiliary 6th conceivd lhan described, the notes of occupied preparation. Hello, and the sovnd of the wagons broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants with regard to the vigilance of the ovreme tobeir, they lost their graduated ally, leaving him in the custody of an old womone powerless. He pretended the occasion, with bound onc was out of Tbe's room, and in a moment was found in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, clinging his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, ruthless with fury. When a staircase, Lord Ruthven murmured in his row: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, that yourfisler is dishonored. The Wamens are fragile!\" Thus, pushing him to his servants, wbo, who had come in smoke from the old waman. Aubrey could not 1onger supart hiinse1f; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. It was not MENTianized to his sister, wbo wos not present when he entered, as the doctor feared to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the brdegroom left Londan.\nAubrey's weakness has increased; the infusion of praduced bloody symptoms of near-death opproach. He may have desired his sister's guardiari, and when midnight had rung, he told what the reader had hit, and he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards flouted Miss Aubrey's protection; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was all beautiful him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guld.\"\nEN Sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of the Maiesly ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have, bring the British ships rnany to the vjsit—both of the arid merchants of war; and although it is rather out of the sor schlps track linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviatiori of a voyago. We disembark; usually bone, at the bay tbebottom, and while men we employ to water, and tbe shaker trading for cattle with the native TB, the ecclesiastical and myself took a rain on the cave ca1lcd Homer's School, and other places, where the wohad was before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain named it) we met clnd engulfed o yovng Greck as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the sour island days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose lo exitMitylene, where I am likely to get married. Ho was a weird man, but very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, tbe winc-trader, six zechincs grouped for her, (about L250 Eriglish currency,) and haf resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he failed in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time hastening from the house where our compatriot had seized. We were in kiridly received 6y an old man, who corried us over the mansion. He confiscated four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance ball, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet. They were al1 simply decoratcd: light green walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle iri the center, and a small founlain beneoth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a sprlng fixed in the tho side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a sofa lorge or sofcl complete tbe furniture. In the ha1l staod a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there was no mirror, nor a single point. The bedroom had a large mattress lying on the floor of Tbe, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pil1ow – the cot in all of Greece. In the Siltirig room, we observed a marble reef, somorally, as we were told by the old mon, filled with bo0ks and papers, which are found in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the contents of the tbe. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Vo1ney; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook's Messla; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play af the Robbers; Milton Lost's Paradise, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, torn muoh, but no Eriglish's book of any description. Most of these books were wired with marginal notes, written with a pencll, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked wlth flips of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man did: \"The Lord had read these books before he left, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for it is so special, that if I were to move something without order, he would frown me for a week together; it is in other ways ergy g0od. I made him a sorcerer; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of maintenance, except twenty zechins which I pay to an old Armenlan who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe appearance of the house was extraordinarily pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and broad fovret, and the marblc pilIars canned with black plinths and frct work cornices (as it is now cuslornary in the Greek architect,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roaf, overwrapped by a light stone balvstrade, was c0vered by a fine turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus smoked, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christl\", eating fruit, arid enlivening the evenjng breeze.\nOn the left, we inherited the house, a small creek gliding, grapes, oranges and lindens were gathered on its edges, arid under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a grated seat with an omemental wood back was folded, on which we were told, the lord possessed many of his enigs and around until twelve o'clock, gnawing, writing, and speaking at bimsolf. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"that he was very pious, and that he always attached himself to our chureh twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe vlew of tbis seot was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, coveted with olive trees and myrles in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic deoay. A smalI stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, unti1 it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The glass sca smootb, and the ari horizon not eclipsed hy o fingle cloud, lermincltes the view will be; and a little on the left, through a view of high hazelnuts and trace palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald willing. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our cnquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had residoded in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name bvt Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Cclndia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say it, but I'm sure he won't, \"and can't you say it, old money?\" he said, \"if I can,\" he said, \"I dare not.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, bul upon our return to the city we learned several details of the seclusion lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with him at the Nuptillian feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and bacon to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a sisterman who had lost his own in a gclle, and he gave Greek tests to poor children. In short, have we appeared, frowned upon all that we have gathered, for having been a very eccentric and benevo1cnt character. A circumstance that we learned, that our old friend at the cottage bought clean not t0 disolose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord wos often saw walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him bimseSi the use of this one.\nThis was the information with wbich wc leaving the peaceful island Mitylene bones; our imagination everything on the rack, guessing who tbis crawling in Greece could be. He had the enmity, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular geriatric. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Fallirig in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had traveled to Egypt and Greee, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are so anxlous, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trips to the island of Tenedof, and I cllso visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of bis Lordship, as we had been a few ycars of the house; bul \"Child Harolde\" being put in our hands we recognized the reclvfe of Calcla in the page of evory. Did we not regret not having been more curious iri our researcbes at the cottage, but we ourselves had the idea to return to Mitylene ori on a future day; bvt to me that day ncver returned. I make this statement, I relieve it of all interest, and in court in the good name of its seigneury, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease his eyebrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, because the hub is clearly picked up in these small aneodotes. All the finer sons of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his basom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and bis courtirig the rest of solitvde is an additional reason to mark hjm as a being whose heart the Hatb religion has put its seal, and on whose head Benevolence hatb has cast his coat. Noman can read the previous pleasant \" traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume that an opinion should be given. Reports must be received with caution, in particular the dock directed against the moral integrity of man; arid the one who justifies himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a felIow-mortal. Lord Byron's cabracter is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest tesalonia of a virtuous heclrt and a scelerate conscience of approval.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "46": "VAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based Js very general in lhc East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until the completion of Christianity; and it assumed its present forms only the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea 6 becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, jl gravillly increased, clrid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still ecstatic, af the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and 6eavti fvl. In the West, it spread, with the same slight variation, all the rest of Hungary, Poland, Austrio and Lorraine, where the belies existed, thal vampyres nigblly soaked up some of the blood of the victims, which became emaciatcd, losl thoir force, and died quickly of consumption; while these suckers of human blood grastene d and their veins became distended to such a state structure, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyism, which is said to have taken place in Madrcyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the ondinagistrat commandant-in-chies of the square, lbey posjtively and unanimously asserted, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been bearded to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way lo to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and ruhbing himself with his blood. However, this prediction did not prevent him from becoming a bimself vampyr; for about twenty or thirty days after his arid burial men complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was incapacitated, that four persons had been deprived of life by his altacks. To sow evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as Is supposed to be vsual in the oasis of vampyrism) fresh, and enlire free of coruptian, and omit in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was driuen eritirely brough the heart and badger of Arriold Paul, where he is reported to have arched ovt as terribly as if he had been alive. Thcy cut his head, burned his body, and threw the asbes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses af the people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, receive 6 genles on the othors who survived them.\nThe universala1 belief is, that a porson sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and sucks in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, it seems better suited to the subject matter of these observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for somo hejnous crimc commitwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only sentenced to vampyrise, but como1d to make his Those whom he loved, while he was on earth — tbose to whom he was bound by lies of kinship and affection. — A silence of supp0 referred in the \"Giaou r.\"\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, Thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and hate the native room, and suck the blood of every race: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wise, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet hate the banquet which by force must feed thy livid living chore, Thy victims, which are yet exhaling, Sha1l knoweth the devil for their sire. You curse them like sheep, Your waves are swallowed up on the limb. But so far as your crime must fall, the youngest, beloved of AlI, bless him with the name of a father—The hot word will wrap your coffin in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the vitreous gaze lasl must uiew that freezes his lifeless blue; then with vnhall0wed the hand will tear The braids of yellow hair ber, of which iri Ilfe a lock when the deep pledge of affection has been carried—But now is corned by the memorial of your agony! And yet thou hast the best drop of water, thy grinning tooth, the arid lip of the hook; then the harkirig to thy tomb, go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in h0rror shririk far from Fromspectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also irtroduced iri his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", lhe vampyre Corsican of the servant Arclbian Orieiza, which is represented as avirig returned from the grave in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to be hclve results from the finesse of his life, it has been spilled over the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veritable Tournefort gives a long rush in its lravols of several cases astoriishirig af vampyrisrn, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this svbject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and draditionary narratives illustriate-\nive of its effects, put forward some leamed dissertations, harassing to prove that it is a classioal, as well as barbaric error.\nMany eurious and interesting opinions about its singularly horrible superstition are added; although the present can sufsice for the limits of a note, necessarily consecrated to explanatiori, and which can now be concludedddd by mercly remclrking, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, here are several other synonyms it the mind, makes use of in varjus part of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Gou1, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the rinidsl of accompanying difcipations during a London winter, it appeared to the various parts of the bone loaders a ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirtb around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the air attracted only his attenton, so that he could by a jeook choke him, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain from where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, six on the sace of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the thc earl; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed vpon the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities used him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, on those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of him, were happy to have something in their presence capablc to engage their attention. In spite of the emotion of passion, it is a beautiful emotion on the part of the hunter woman, after having tried to seize him, and to win, in her turn, some marks of what could be called affection: Lady Mercor, who was the mockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriagc, fought on his way, arid only put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract attention: —thugb in vain:—when he stood before hjm, although his cyes were apparently fixed on the hor's, still he seemed bone if they were not percevod;—everi hcr inappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But adultery ornmon could not influence even the guidclnco of the eyes bis, it was n0t that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tone; and that it was that even he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were inovated by his appearancel hatrcd of vlce, he was often among those women who formed the boasting of their sex fr0m the domestic ir virtues, as among those who jostling her by their vices.\nAround the time of the samo, the Landon a young man of the oss name Aubrey: he was cln orphari left wilh only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in the ehil. Left to him, too, by guardians, who simply took care of his fortune, while they abandoned an important charge of his mind to the interest of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated more bis imagination than hif judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruines so many learnings of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, arid thought that the vice was thrown by Pravidenee simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of tbe vest of clothes, which wero as hot, but whlch were better suited to the eye of the pclinter by their irregular sales and various colorod patches. It was the reality of life. He is beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the jnto gay circles, in no mother svrovrided him, by striving who could describe with the truth loast their favorite Ianguishjng or grunt: the girls of the same time, by the whirlwind of faces when he climbed, and by their sparkling eyes, when he worked his lips, he quickly led to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the aroma of his s0litary hours, he was surprised to discover, that, except in the tallow and candles of wax thclt clickered, not of the prcfenoe of a ghost, 6ut of lack of snuffing, there was no fovndation jn rea life in one of these congreries of pleasant images and descripions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, inclining, a little componation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dream, what is the extraordinary being that we have above descried, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the impassibity itself of forming an idea of the character of a man absorbed into himself, who gave other signs of his observation of external objects, that the lace accord to their existnco, involved in the avoidance of contact with him: allowing his imagination to trap everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this ohject irito the hero of a novel, and decided to observe the outpouring of his fantasies, rather than the person who preceded it. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced on his opinion, that the presence of hjs was still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the prayer notes in — Street, he realized that he was abovt to travel. Desiring to obtain some informal rospeeting this singular chclracter, which, until now, had only brandished his curiosity, he haunted his guclrdians, that it was time for him to make the tour, which, during the generations mclny af we thought ncesfary to burden the young to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards pvting themselvos on a equality wjth the old, and not to allow them to appear as so faIlen of heaven, which is not scandalous aro rentionate intrigues as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to listen to them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his jenteritions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to make him fram a proposol lo ioin. Flatterod by such a mark of esteem of him, wh0, apparently, had nothing in common with other rnen, he readily accepted it, and iri a few days they had spent the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Au brey does not have the opportunity to study Lord Rvthven's caroctor, and now he has four, lhat, although many others of his actians have cxposod to his uiew, the results have made different conclusions of the opparent motives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality;—theidle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation, even on virtue, that he gave his alms; - these were the sneezes of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to let him harden himself in the lust bis, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich chclrity. This, however, was attributed to the greater import of the vicious, which generally outweighs the absenteeism of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumftarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still rnoré improssed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, irievitobly found shot thero wos a curse on her, for they were all led to the scaffold, or sank lo tho arid the lowest misery abjecl. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent impatience of his componion sougbt for the centres of al1 vlce in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of foro: he gagged, and always played with suooess, except where he knew stronger was his antagonlst, and then he even lost rnore that he won; but it was always with the same faee, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young navicc, or the unlucky father of a family number 0us; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit which he had set aside, and his eyes shrouded with innore firc that of the cat who daltered with the half-dead movse. In each city, he left the old rich yyuth, torn from the circle, he decorated, cursed, in tbo solitudo of o donjon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this ficnd; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the labs of hungry mutes, without a single farthing of hjs lote immense wealth, where to buy of the cuen enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the playable; but immcdiatery lost, to the ruiner of many, the last giIder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often began to represent tbis to his friend, and begged him to restate this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and the riots tended to his own profit;—6and he delayed him—for on the same day hpod his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and professionally; h0wevcr, this never happened. The Lord Ruthvon in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich backgrounds of nature, was always the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain any more gratification than he constected apart from wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exaute imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily workshop on the morning circle of a Countess of Itcllien, while he went in search of the memorials of another dese-\nIt's the city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first was sr0m his sister, breathing not hlng but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before enteredod into his imagination there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give hlm enough reason for delusion. His guards insisted on his imediatly leaving his frjend, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irritable powers of feduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to the self. It had been discovorous, that hjs contempt for the adultrus had not been born in hatred of his character; but that hc had demanded, in order to harass his gralegy, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had thrown himself the pinccle of the unsweeted virtuoso, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those femaïes whom he had shuddered, apparently because of their virtue, hcld, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed the wh0e deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose ch aracter had again n0t shown cl only light pear on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning the hiin completely, seeking, in the average wbie, to look at it more clofely, and not to let pass any slight cjrcumstance. He entered the same circle, and soon to be seen, that his Lordshjp was dying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; he was thored to wear his plons in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discussed that an assignment had been ascribed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent, though insensitive, girl. When he did not lose timo, he entered Lord Ruthven's party, and asked him arduously his intentions with respect your lady, informing bim at the same time that he was aware of his beab0ut to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that all would have had such an opportunity; and after having been pressed if bo intended to marry him, simply ugly. Aubrey withdrew, and immediately, writing a nole, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his dclughter, but also with regard to the baracter of his Lordfhip. Assigration was avoided. Lord Rulhven noxt day simply sent his seruclnt to inform his full assertion to a sepclration; bvt a ri0t hlnt any susplicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubrey'f interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey directed the steps from hjs to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon faund at Athenf. He then fixed his residonce in the house a Greek one; and soon occupied gluteIf by tracing the faded traces of g1ory annoyed on the tbatap monumerits apparently, slammed to chronicle the acts of Freomen only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the tight ground or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter who used to spread ori oanvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke to a lot of mjnd so that someone thought that she could blonge those who did not have sovls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought the gazelle o poor lype of her bcauties; for what it would have been had she exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for lhat drowsy look luxurious bone the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ian l'Aubrey often accompanied in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the girl unconsciovs, engaged in the pursuit of a buttorfly of Kashmere, show all the beauty of his form, f1oating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgave the letters that he had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the contemplation of his figure of sylpha. Often, her braids fell, or she was scattered, displayed in the ray of the sun such delicately brilliant and quickly soothing shades, this could excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who escaped from his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital impertinence to the irriterpretation propor from a passage in Pausanias. Bul why try to describe the damage that everyone feels, 6ut nono can appreciate?—It was innocencc, young, and healthy, disused by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating 6alls. Whi1ft he drew these remains of whoieh that he wished to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood up, and looked at the magio effects of the hif penoil, tracing the scenes of his nativo place; she would then describe to him the dancc turning on the open plain, painted, him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she renembercd seeing her childhood; and then, turning to the thclt subjects had obviously shaped a greater impression on his mind, would tell him the supernatural stories of her nurse. His sincerity and his apparent belief in what she was telling, excited Aubrey's furnace of interest; and often as she told her the story of livjng uampyre, who had passed through the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, his blood rvn eold, what1st he tried to ridicule her ossucb idle and horrible fantclsies; but Iantbe quoted to her the names of an old meridian, who had finally detected one living among them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the ampli of the oppetite of the fien; and when she found that he was so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had been noticed that those who dared to question the existence, had always had evidence, wbich o6liged, with pain and tear, for the eifess it was true. She detailed the traditional operance of these monsters bimly, and her horror was magnified, with a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; ho, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there would be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many eoincidences that had all tcnded to excite a belief in Lord Ruthueri's supernatural power.\nAubrey began to grieve more aridly at Ianthe; his innoence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babits, marrying a Greek without instruction, he found himself still more and more attached to the form of an almose fairy before leaving. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, determined not to return until his object wcls reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention bis on the ruins around him, which in the bis spirit he kept an image that seemed olono lhe legitimizing of bis thoughts. Ianthe was uriconscient of his love, and wcls always the same frank child that he had known the first time. She always managed to separate from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one with whom she could see her appetites, while her guardian was occvcpicated in the sketch or discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the underjeet of Vampyres, arid they both, with several present, confirmed their existence, cling with horror to the very name. Soon Aubrey decided to proceed on one of his excreslons, which he had to detach for a few hares; when they heard the dwarf of the p1ace, all at once begged of bim nol to come back at night, for he had to necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever be rebuked, after the closing of the day, to serious consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced most of the hea vy evjls as approaching the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey Madc highl of thelr representati0ns, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his audacity so as to mock a superi0r, insernal powcr, whose very name apparently made their hood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the face of his host, and he was confounded to see that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible ones, had inspired them to such terror. Whenhc was hastened to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him for revenge, and allowed the power of the beings of the lasc to be put into action;—he promised. Ho was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day would be so0n fine, and that in the borizon there was one of these flies whicb, in the warmer climates, so patiently gathorinto a huge mass, and pour out all their rage vpon the devoted country.—He finally, however, mounted his horse, determinod ta compensate by the speed for his delay: but he was taole. The twilight, in these southern cljmates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it was aduanced far away, the storm's power was above — its exuberant thvnders had barely a resting interval—they thick heavy raln forced his way through the eanopying foliage, while the forked blue light swallowed to fall and radiate to hif vcryfeet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was led quickly dreadsul through the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, hy, the dazzling of lightning, that it was in the neighborhod of a hovol that hardly got up from the masfes of dead leaves and brush...\nood around him. Demonstrating, he approaches, hoping to find someone to guide him to the taon, or at least have confidence to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, contaminating in one almast an uninterrupted sound; — he was surprised: bul, stirred again by thunder, groaned on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He bowed in darkness, but sound guided him. Ho was apparently imporced; for, although hc called, the c0ntinuted sounds, and no advice from him was taken. He found himself in contact with someone, who was seized immediately; when a man cried, \"Again baffied!\", to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt harassed by him whose strength seized superhumans: determined to sell his lifo as dcarly as he had it, he read; but he was at Valn: he was ljfted by his sensation and angry by the energizing force against the ground: — his enemy threw himself on hlm, and the knee1er on the chest, hcld placed his hands bis on his tbroate — when the abyss of many torches penetrating tbrougb the hole that gave light in the day, the trouble; — he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the o0r, and in an instant tho crashlng of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there, and Aubrey, iricapablc to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the valleys of mud, and the thatched loaded on every heavy wjtb straw flakes of sole. At Auhrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted her by shouting; he went back into the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of thor torchef once mare burst into her, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a corse without life. He closed his eyes, saying that it was only a vlsion from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, if he shut them, lying by his side. There was no colovr on his cheek, not even on his lip; however, the thero was a still1ness on his face that felt almost as attached as life was there: — on his neck squats blood, and on his throat were marks of teelh having opened the vein: — to this men p0ints, crying, simultaneousovsly struck with horror, \"In Vampyre! A vampire!\" A littcr was quickly abandoned, and Aubrey was laid beside her who had latoly heen thc subject to so many brilliant and fairy visions, now fal len with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mind was eaten up and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refugo in the vacuum — he held in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had engaged bcen in the search for ber that a molher had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe their grief would be impossible; hut when they checked the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubreyêtre put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was delusional of delusion; in these incredulous he wou1d oall on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination he complained of begging his former companion to spare the beloved being. At other times, he threw himself on the head of imprecise maldictions, and cursed him as his destr0yer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity to arrive in Athens, and, fleeing any motive, after hearing Aubrey's stclte, immediately dragged himself into the same house, and became his cannon escort. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sigbt of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Rulbven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault which had coincided with their separation, and even more by the attention, the emphasis, and oore w hich being shown, soon reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as the bis recovery began to be rclppid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived n0 differentoe of the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet bis gaze fixed interitly on him, with a smile of maliciovsexullation playing on his lips: heknew not why, but this smile failed. During the last period of recovery of the irivcllid, Lord Rvthven apparently undertook to capture the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or iri marking the progresf af tbose orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to auoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the wbich spirit had once distinguished him so well now seemed to be running away forever. Today he was also a lover of the salitude and silence of Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his spirit did not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruiris which he had previously frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed to drool in the middle of the undergrowth, in q uesl de lho modeste violel; then suddenly turnniriground, w0uld show, with his wild irgination, his pale face spanned his wounded throat, with a sweet smie vpon his lips. He decided to steal sccnes, all of which created such bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven,ta that he was bound by the earth care he mistaked from him during his Illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece ncilhor had seen again. They passed through every diroclion, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached: bvl though tbey thvs hclstened from plaee in place, but they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to digest these reports, which they imagined as the invention of iridjvidvals, whose interest was to excite the generosjty of those whom they draped from the supposed dangers. As a result, they did not take into account the advice of the inhabitants, they once traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides to the cles than in defense. By committing themselves, however, a narrow layer, at the bottom of wbicb, was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they reasoned to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were put into the water by the whistling of bullets near the head of toir, and by the echoed ratio 0f sev-\nGuns. In an accident, their guards left them, and, placing them behind rocks, they started firing in the direction from which the camo report. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, abandoning their example, withdrew for a moment behind the glimmer of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with the insult of the Badethem shovels, advanced, and to be exposed to the slaughter of urine, if one of the robbers were to go up above and take them to the rear, they immediately went out to rush in search of the enemy. Hard1y had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in thc's rubbish, which brought him to the grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, na longcr taking into account the contest or his own pcril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthveri was wounded, thrown jmmediatcly his arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and, agreeing on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were simply plotting the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength diminished rapidly; in two days morlisicatjon followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the ohjects; but towards the end of the evening, his mind proved uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who provoked his donkey with more than the usual order – \"Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I mean nat my life, I have listened to death if my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I could have done anything,\" replied Aubrey.\"I'm very lucky, my life weakens, I can't excuse the whole thing, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was unleashed for a while in England, I was exploding. \"—\"He won't be a kriown. \"Swcar!\" cried the dying man, raising his sons to the exultant violence, \"Swear by al1 your walkers, by all your nature, swear thal, a year and a day that you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, whatever the rnay haperi, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with shrouded sockets: \"I sweat!\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but did not rest; many circumstances having informed him of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he joined his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presentation of something horrible waiting for bim. Rising early in the morning, he was about to crack the houel in which he had left the corpse, when a thief the methim, and informed him that there was no lorig there, having been transported by himself and his comrades, on his withdrawal, to the pinriacle of a nearby mountain, in accordance with a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the inoan that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the severe of men, dissuades from going to bury him in the place where he is prostituted. But when he had mounted on the light, he found no trace of the corpse or drapes, although the thieves swore that lhey was reporting the same rock on which he had laid the body. For his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the body for the good of clothes.\nWeary of a hoax in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in wbich all apparently conspired to heigblen superstitious thal melancholic tbat had seized on his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naplès, he occupied itSi, by arranging these effects, he had with him a blo0riging to Lord Rulhven. Among other things, there was one case containing several tsaporis of offence, more or less adapted 10 to ensure the death of the victim. There were daggers and atagharis. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forerunners, what was his surprise to findjng o sheaths apparently or named in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get further evidence, he found the weapon, and bishor can be imagined when he discovers that he adapted, although in special shape, lehoalh that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: the sip seemed to bind to the dagger; but he still wanted to distract himself; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the haft and the sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and lcft n0 chamber for the doubl; there were als0 drops of blaod on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and orientated his way back to Rome, his first investigations focused on the lody he had tried to rip off the seductive arts of Lard Ruthven. Her parenl were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heclrd since the detachment of her seigneury. Aubrey's spirit became almosl broken under so mary horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ian ho. He became morose and silent; and his only oocupation was to exhort the speed of the postjlions, af if he went to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived in Calais; a breoze, whieh, seemed obedient to his will, soon to be thrown hiin on the banks of the Englisb; and he hastened to the home of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in him kisses and listens to his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more altache as a compariori.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the drawlng-room assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the warm atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the benetb spirit. Tbere was a melancholic charm the abaut who did not have secm to emerge from malfortunc, but from a caring feeling with ln, which appearsod t0indioate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not that the light foot, whicb errandswhere'er a butterfly or moyattract color—it was sedate ond pensive. When alone, her sace was enlightened by the smile of joy; nvt when her brother broke her affection, and would be in her presence forget the sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have excavated her smile for that of the euluptaire? It seemed that these eyes, hat faoes were playing in the light of their own natal sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought by her guardians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return to the continent, when he could be his master. That was now, that's why, solved the next show, whieh was approaching quickly, should be the efooh of his entry into the \"abuse scene. \"Aubrey would have walked in the house of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that had given him power. He did not feel interested in fashioned strangers' treats, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; bul he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon arrived in the city, and propared for the next day, wblch had been rinsed like a living room.\nThe crowd of Tbe was in excess: a living room had not been held for a long time, and a1l who was anxious to rest in the smile of the kingship, rushed there. Aubrey was there with her sister. What did he do in a corner of himself, without taking into account all that was around him, that he remembered that the first lime he had seen was there, that he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and that a voice which he recognized too well, sounded to his ear: \"Remember your oath.\" He had little caurage to turn, fearing of seeing the specter that would blaser him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his nolice such a place when he first entered society.\nYes. He was watching until his almast limbs refused to wear their cold blood.\nHe was forced to take the arm of a friar, and to force a passage to the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed over the room with shouting steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that thoughts hjs would burst out of his brain. Lord Rvthven again before him — the circumstances began in the dreadfuI array — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up hjmself, he could riot nice c possible — the dead rise again! — He thought his evil imagination conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to g0 again instacity; for tangb he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the nclme hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in the Gairig information. He left a few nights after his sister's death at the emblem of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a rocess, and there he gave himself to his own devours. Perceivjng, finally, which many were leaving, he dried up, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by seueral, apparently in serious convulsion; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, and rebuked to him those feces that he had maft abharred. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, pressed her to the foot.\nAnd: the gate which he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants who lamented for their lords; and while he took care of making of it, he heard tbat voiioe whispering beside him: «Remember thy aath!», he dared not turn, 6ut, burry bis sister, soon arrived at home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. So before it was absorbed by a subjecl, how much more completely it was absorbed, n0w than the certainty of the monster's life again prefect on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to expose to her what had cavized her abrupt ooriduct. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he ate, the more disconcerted he was. His oats surprised him;—was he to allow this monster to wander, bearing ruln on his breath, in the midst of all that he cherished, did he not cling to his progress? His sister was touched by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought that he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such misery; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days he reincarnated himself in this state; locked in hjs r0om, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister Carne, who, eyos spirit flowing with tears, begs him, for his false, sustains nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered through the street of Srom, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed at midi-doy svn as t0 l'indight darnp s. He was no greater than he had been recognized; at the end of the year he took refuge in the house, but at last he lay down to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. Hjs' sister, anxious for her safety, worked the clog for the followers; but they quickly djstagned themselves by hlm who were fleeing the stunning of a pursuer only any—of the thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absenee he all his friends, with a fiend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined t0 to enter the society again, and to look at him closed, arixieux to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intjmacy. But when he entered a room, hjs hclggclrd and suspicious looked so dizzying, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to deceive, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. Whcn, however, the demonstration provod inavailing, the guards thought appropriate to interpose, engaged, fearing that his mind became alienated, they tangbl it high time to remind me that wblch trust had been before jmposed on them by Aubrey parentf.\nDesiring to save the hiin from the wounds and sufferings that he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent bim from exposing to the general eye the marks of what they corisidcred madness, they instructed a doctor ta resjde in the house, and to take care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely was his mirid absorbed by a terrifying subject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was confined to his room. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. He had fainted, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier; — the only sign of affection and memory remaining exposed at the entrance of his sister; then he would begin, and, taking his hands, with eyes that touched him greatly, he desired that she should not touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, it's your love for me, don't come near him!\" Wheri, however, she asked whom he was referring to, her only mercy was, \"True! lruo!\" and a gain that he sank in a slate, from which even she could roam him. This has lost many months: graduated, however, as the year passed, his incoherenccs are less frequent, and his mind has thrown a part of his morosity, whip his ohserved guards, than several times in the doy he counted on his fingers a defined number, and then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan on the melancholic circumstances of Aubrey's being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was gojng the next day to get married. Aubrey's immediate attention fainted; he became anxiously angry with whom. Happy with this mark of return of the intellect, of wbieh they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that he has hid mel wilh in society, Aubrey seems to plead, and amazes even more by his exposf with his intention to be present at tbe nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently an ego capable of being affected by the influence of the beautiful ber smile; for he pressed her to his breosl, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, running to the thought of his bra being once again happy at the expense of affection. He began to talk with all the hjs desired warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distanced for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a l0cket on his chest; openirig it, the whale was surprised to see the characteristics of the monster that had so long influenced life. He seized the portrail in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under fo0t. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resombolaric of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her—thon seizi was grating her heels, and looked at her with a frenetic expression of eunleriance, he made swear her tal that she would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not move forward—he saw as if this voice of a new bade hirn remembered his oath—he turned with turn of turn, thinking that Lard Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and the thaught thif was only a reminder of his disorder, entered, and removed him from Miss Aubrey, pushed her to leave him. He fell on his knees, yours, begged to delay them, but for one day. They attached this to the folly they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, worshipped him pacifying, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had clenched in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard Aubrey's disease, he easily understood the cause of the disease; but when he learned that he was considered mad, exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had acquired tbis computerian. He hastened to the bosom of the former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretense of great affection for the brother and interest in the hif fato, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's ear. Who resists his power? His tongve had dangers and toils to tell – could speak of himself as an individual bavirig, no sympathy with a being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed;— could say how, since he knew hor, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were inert that he could listen to his bloody aocents;—jn sine, he knew so well how to use the arl of the serpent, or subb was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. Tbe litle of the eldest 6ranch falling to the lerigth to him, he obtained a great carelessness, whieh served as an excuse to hasten the marriage, (in spite of the state of derariness of his brother,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent TB.\nAubrey, while left by the doctor on his guard, tried to run for the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a popor; jt was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happirief, her own honor, and the honaur of those who are now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their boop and the hope of their house, to delay bvt sor a sewn of the hours of this marriage, on which he denounced the heavy foot-cover of mofl. The servarils promised that they would abandon him; but in giving this to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrcy's mind any more by, what he regarded as cd, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the detained bvsy of the house; and Aubrey heard, with horror or which can more easily be conceived than described, notes of busy preparation. The morning came, the smile of the cars broke on the bis ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants, at last, gradually fled, leaving him in the custody of an old helpless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied was out of the room, and in a mummcnt was in the apartment where all were almost asscmbled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the hjm: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by forco, he shook him from the storm, said Iss with fury. On the stairs Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my blunder today, that your fist is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So, he said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old W0man, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer beg himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey iricreased; bloodshed produced symptoms of near-death approximation. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when the hour of the night had struck, he told in a composite way what the reader had perpetuated, for he died immedlatoly afterward.\nThe guards called in to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they got in, it was too late. Lord Rvthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYR0N IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailjng via Greek Arophipelago, on board one of the ships of bis Majestyf, in the year 1812, we pvt in the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The 6theauty of his place, and the supply of sweets and vegetables which must always be there, bring many ships to visit him, warmen and merchants; and he is away from the traok for the ships baund in Smyrna, his bonuses quickly reimburse the Deviltian of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the shipowner negotiated for Cattlo with the natjves, the ecclesiastical, and I took a ramble to the school of Homer, and to other places, where we had been established. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound named) We met and hired a young Greek like our gvid, wbo told us that he had come from Sci0 with an English lard, who left the island four toys before we arrived in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and wovld took me with him; bvt I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am likely to freeze married. He was a weird man, but he was very obsessed. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man to ohclrge of him: give Dominick, the winemaker, fix a hundred zechins for her, (about L250 English currency,) arid lived there about fourteen months, tbovgh not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands.\"\nThis account greatly expiated our euriosity, and we did not waste time hastening at the house where our compatriot had residuded. We were greeted by an old man, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bed-ornate, with a spacious and anxious closet. They were all simply decorated: grace walls, marble tables on the eitber side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneclth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a sma1l hronze Venus iri a loan posture; a sofa or sofa largo completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bo0k-case: thcre were not mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one largo mattress or float, with two cotton duvets and a glitter pillow, the common outfit throughout Greece. In the living room we observed unstoppable dreams, once, the old man said uf, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the fence: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the taleries. On the tahlet 0f the recreation poses Voitaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and the works of Roussoau eomplete; the Ruins of Emplres of Volncy; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Miltan Lost, an edition of Italion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and bitten with a brief of paper, on which were also reinarks.\nThe old Mccln said: \"The Lord had read books of tbesus in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he turns; for it is so special that I had to move something without orders, hc would frown me together for a week; it is otherwise very good. One day I did him a favor; I had the product of this fclrm for the work of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\"\nThe operation of the house outside was pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the split marble piIlars with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrclde, was covered with a hard Turkey arpet, benetb with a strong coarse lineer's awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus shaved, as on them the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking Iigbt wines, like \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we have wcre lold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights tjll twelve o'c1oek, reading, writing, and lalking to bimseIf. \"I beg your pardon,\" said the old man, \"praylng\" because he was very fervent, \"and cl1ways frequented our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\"\nThe view of the Tbis seat was what can be called a bird view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle Iri flower, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended from the broken waterfalls of iri, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth bone glass of the sea, and a h0rizan unskinned by a single cloud, finishes the iew in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several Sinall islands were observed distinctly, spanning the 1-ighl blue wave with spots of eraud green. I had a view tuna pond I djd that; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the Persian who had resided in romantic solitude tbis: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he won't,\" and carinot yov said, old frierid?\"I said, \"If I can,\" he exclaimed, \"I don't dare.\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, bul upon our return to the city we learned the seueral details of the isoline lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even dariqued wilh at the wedding party. He gives a cow to an inan, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who weave these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own wind blow, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been a very eccentric and bcnevolent character. Dried circumstance that we learned, that our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not t0 difcloso. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord often walked by the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use it.\nThese are the elements of the formation that we left from the island of Mitylene; our jmaginations all on the rack, guesserig that this logger in Greece coveld being. He had money that he was evidenl: he had dispasitiori philarithropy, and all the tbose eccentricities that mark particular gonius. Arriving in Palermo, all our d0ubts have been dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the Archlect, a student of WYATT'S, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, about whom you are so worried, js Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylerie.\" We had never heard of the fame of his Lord Shlp, if we had been home for a few years; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put jnto our hands we recognized the reclusion of Calcla in every page. Did we not regret that the riot was more serious in our research on the cottage, but we comforted our ideas with the idea of returning to Mitylone some future day; but to me that day I did not see again. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely without intermence, and in court in the right name of its seigneury, which was grossly gloomy. It has been disordered bone an insensitive disposition, contrary to the asso-\nciatirig with human nature, or contribute in any way to countering its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly tho inverse, as can accumulate ploiinly fram tbese small anecdotes. All the fine tho fcelings of lhc heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, scem to have their seat in his bosoin. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his aetations: arid his wrath the reboso of solitude is an additional reason sore marking the hive as a sob on whose heart the Religion has put its seal, attached on the head of which Benevolenoe has cast his mountain. No renan idiot has read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not imagine that he has the right to give an opinlon. Replies must always be received with cautiori, especially when directed against the mora1 integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where he must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrere-mortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his geniu s. To do good in secret, and shuri thc the applause of the world, if the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-adhesive consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Printer, Crown-covrt, F1cet-street.",
    "47": "VAMPYRE;\nA Talc.\nBy Jahn Willlam Polldori\nTHE superstition on wbich this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks to untie the establishment of Christianity; and it has deafened only its present forine since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that the Latin body could not corrugate if it was buried in their territory, it gradually lncroased, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful storios, still excavated, of the dead rising from their graus, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the Wost, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorcline, where there was a belief that vampyres soaked some of the blood of the victims, who became emaciated, lost the strength of the thorax, and died suddenly of consummations; these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veiris became distended to such a state of repulsion, so that they caused 6lood your f1ow of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the March Jovrnal of London, I732, is a curious, and, from covrsc, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrlsm, which was declared to have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they positivly and unanimously affirmed, e at, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, ncliné Amold Poul, had been heard to say, thclt, clt Cassavia, on the borders of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of him1f 0f evil, eating part of the land ovt from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself bimbe with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent Bim himself from becoming a vampy; for, about twenty or thirty days astray his death and burial, many people complained of being t0rmented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid the furious malformations, the inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usval in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and avirons, pure and florid blood. As Praos was anointed, they resorted to the usual remedy. A slakk was led whole into Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is reported to have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw ashes into his rubble. The same measures were adopted with the corses of these people who had already died of vampyrism, and who, in turn, should become agents on others who survived larn.\nTbo the universal beliof is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre hirnself, and svcks in turn.\nChief Bai...\nff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relocated, beeause it seems better suited to illustrate lbe subject af current obscrvations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is oonsidered as a kind of punishment aftor dead, for some odious cleric shared while he is in existence, tal the deceased is not on 1y do0med to vampyrise, but forced lo confino his infernal visits only to beings that he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A punctuation alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall be praised from his tom6; then shall the shawl fall into the place of origin, and shall suck the blood of thy seed: from thence thy daughter, thy wife, by midnight, drain the stream of the Iife; yet hate the baricet that shall feed the living corse by liuid, thy victims, are yet come to pass, and shall know the devil for the sire: as thou cursest, thou cursest them, thy flaws are dried upon the stem. But he who mocked the crime, the youngest, the most beloved of AlI, will bless this word with the name of satcher: This word will set your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last tingc of his choek — the last spark of his eye, And the last shiny ice must see Who freez o'er his lifeless blue; Thori with the hand urihallowed will tear The braids of his yellow hair, From which, in llfe o lock wbcri sh0rn The bottom of the affection foot was wom—But now is borrious far from you Memorial of thin agony! But with the lhinowri the best hlood will flow; Your tooth of gnashlng, and the lip of haggard; Then tracking at your grclve of sulten, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Until these iri horror shririk far from the spectro more cursed than tbey.\nMr. Southey also presented in his wild but hairy poem of \"Thclloba\", the vampy corsc of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned to the grave with the aim of tormenting him that she loved better during her life. But the tbis are not plentiful to have resulted from the sinnoss of his life, it has been spilled throughout the o is the account of a fault of purity and innocence. The Vérocieux Tournefort makes a long account of the devouring journeys of amazing cases of vampyism, so that he claims that he was an eyewjtness; and CaImet, in his great work on this subjcct, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional illvstrative accounts of his efsets, put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classical error, so barbaric bone.\nOne could add many crunches and interesting notes on tbis singularly horrib1e superstjtion; although the present may suffice for the limits of a riot, necessarily devolved to explanalion, which can now conclude by merely pointing out, that although the term Vampyre is that in inost generaI acceptance, there are several otbers synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the warld: like Vraucoloeha, Vardoulacha, GouI, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London writer, there appeared to the diversity of the qualities of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light larb of the sair attracted only his atonation, that he would stare at him, and cast fear into those fucking breasts reigned careless. Those who felt this senseatiori of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the eye gray deod, whlch, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance your pierce through the interior works of tbe heort; hut fell on the cheek with a reed of lead weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculioritios invited him into all the houses; all wanted the seo, and those who had been accused of violence oxcitemeritis, and now selt lhe pesel of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging the attention of the thalers. Despite the deadly tint of her face, which never won a warmer draw, eithor srom the blush of modesty, or a strong emotion of pass ion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notori ety tried to gain his attention, and galn, aside, some marks of what they cursed term of affection: Lady Mercer, who badbe lbe mocked every monster worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and put everything except on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her notioe: — although in uan:—when she stood at him, although her eyes apparently fixed on her, still it seemed that they were unperceived; — even her inapprehensive impvdence was flouted, and she licked the field. But even if the adultery commune never affected the Guidanco of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was jniffed to him: but such was the apparent oaution with wbicb that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, whom few ever knew strange hc gluseSi aux femmes. Ho had, ancestor, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was tal he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that this thoy was moved by his apparent hatred of the apparatus, he was also often among the thor fe women who boast of their sex erode their domestic virtues, as I am those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphan lefl with a small sister in possession of hail, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also t0 hesels by the guardians, who have thovgbt the more simple duty to take care of his fortune, while they have taken into account the greater shade of his mlnd in the custody of the meroenary subalterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, moreover, this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, flouting every day so many apprentice militiamen. He all wanted to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice tbat was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, cls that we see in romances: he thought that the inserie of a cottage was simply consisting of the jacket of c1othes, which were so warm, bvt that were better suited to the eye of the painter by the irregular folds Jr and var. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the regalities of the lifo. It is beautiful, frank and rich: for other reasons, on the gay circles around it, many mothers surround it, trying to describe with the least truth their languishing or snoring favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soan led him in false nolons of his talcs and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hares, it was started to find, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not from the preseoe of a ghosl, but from wclnt of snuffing, there was no foundation in the reai life for any thal congreries of pleosing images and descriptions containing iri these volumes, from which he had formed his stvdy. However, by finding some compensation in his gratfied vanilly, he was about to torelinquish bis dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, met him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the charaeter of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assemblage to their existence, implicit by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hls imoginati0n to paint all that flattered them prapensity your extruding ideas, he soon formed this object to the hero of a romance, and determined t0 obscure the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far, in his opinion, his preference has always been recognized. Little by little, he realized that Lord Ruthven's fairs were embarrassed, and soon f0und, seized the nats of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining information somo respeotlng this singular character, which, ti1l now, had only sharpened its curiosity , he suggested that if the guards, it was time for him to by f0rm the tour , that it was deemed necessary for many generatioris to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the care of vice to put themselves at the top of the equality wjlh the elderly , and not to let them appear as if fallen from the skjes , whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as topics of plea or praise , harmonising the degree of skill they have had to wear. TBey consented: and Aubrey immediately murmured his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join Bim. Flattened by Sueh a mclrk of esteem of him, who, apparently, had n0thlng in oomman with other men, he readily accepted it, and iri a few days they had spent the circular wsoins.\nHilherta, Aubrey bad had no opportunity to study the character of Lord Rulhven, and now he found, that, thovgh much more of his aetions were exposed to hisuiew, the results offered different cor inclusions of the apparent pattern lo his condvct. His companiori was profuse in his liherality; — the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing, that it was not insurmountable the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes of companion, even on uirtuc, that he had 6estowed his alms; — these were sent out of the door barely sneezed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, to sink even deeper into his iniquity, he was flanked by rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, gcnerally p revail on the hastily removed from the virtuous needy. There were orie circumstances about the charity of his Lordship, which was more impressed on the mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was our on jt, for all the eithcr were led to the scafsold, or sunk at the lowest and most abject rnjsery. In Brussels and in other cities through the whip, they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the appearance of the greedy with whom the companion bis sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he losl same mare as hc won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he usually swept society around: it was not, rainbow, so when he encountered the novice eruption of youlhfvl, or the father without chance of a Numcroise family; theri his desire uory seemed the law of petune — this apprehensive obstinacy of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat crying with the balm mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, torn from the cirole which he adorned, bent, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this fiendre; while many of a fat man sat frantically, in the midst of the airs speaking silent hungry ohildren, without a song, far from his last immense wealth, where with even 6uy sufficient to satisfy their present desire. However, he did not take from the game table of Tbe; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of m any, the last dorlot that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree 0f knowledge, which was not, however, able to fill the Uvning of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, begged him to resign from charity and charity that proved the destruction of the oll, and did not tend to his own profit;—bvt be delayed—for every day he hoped that his friend would be speaking to him openly and openly; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and arming the wild and rich uarlous scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye dunged less tban his lip; and although Aubrey was near him ohject of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the canonist excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived at R0rne, and Aubrey for a lime lost sight of his companion; he left him in the dailyatlondanee on the morning circle of an Italian countess, while he went in search of the memories of another almost dcserted city. As he was so engaged, letters came from England, which opened impatiently.\nthe first came from his sister, breathing out riots but affection; the others came from his guardians, and the latter surprised him; if he had before enlisted in his enrollment that there was evil power releasing in his companion, they seemed to give him a background sufficient for the bellef. His guards insisted on his impreviable leavlng his friend, and urgcd, that his character wcls terribly vici0us, so that the possession of bones jrresistible power of seduction, made his licentious hahits inore dangerous to silky. It was found wrong, that his contempt for the adulatrice had rioted in the hatred of the chclracter bor; but that he had demanded, for cnhance hjs gratification, that his vlctlm, the partner of his gull, scrambled he threw pinac1e of the non-sullic virtue, up to the lowest abyss of the infclmy and degradation: in the end, that all the fcmals he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since the beginning bis, even thrown the mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose hcld character has not yet shown a single bright polent on which to rest the eye. He solved the invcnt a pretext of plausible abandoning him from far alterthcr, purposing, ln tbe then mean, to whip him closer, and not to let pass any slight circumvmstances. He entered the same circle, and soon perpetuated, that his Lordship endeavoured to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady's house which he mainly frequented. In Italy, it is sold that a married woman is met in the priesthood; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; the eye of bulAubrey followed him in all his fringes, and soon realized that a wrong assignment was effective, which would probably end up ruining an innocent girl, though without thought. Not wasting any time, he set up LordRuthven's apartment, and asked him abruply for his intentions towards the lady, informing her to lime that he was aware of hjs being meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven anesthetized, that his intentions were such cls, he thought that all could have had such an opportunity; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply ugly. Aubrey retired.\nHe ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informed him of all that he kriew, nat only with regclrd to his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena has been notified. The next day, Lord Ruthven rejoiced at not giving full consent to a separation, but he did not suspect that his plans had been thwarted by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Poninsvla, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and the saon took care to take hold of the faded traces of an anesthetic glory over the monumerites apparently, ashamed to tell the acts of the free men before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a beautiful and delicate being that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canuass the promised hope of falsehood in Mohammed's period, except tbat her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that sho ould belong to these who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it was said that gazelle babe was a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look drowsy of the adapted clnima1 but of the heap of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accomodate-\nNied Aubrey in his search for antiquilics, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, show all the beauty of his farm, floating as it carried on the wirid, greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered an almost erasable tablet, in contemplation of figure of hcr sylph. Often, her falling braids, as she flattered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly engaged the hves, he simmered well the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escclpe frormer his mind lbe vory object that he had before being of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate?—It was innocent, youthful and majesty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. To the extent that he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a mcmarial for his future hours, she stood up, arid looking at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of ber native; she could then destabilize the dance encircled on the open plain, painted to her, in all the brilliant colors of youthful memary, the pamp of marriage that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning tosvbjects that had obviously made a greater jmpression on her mind, wovld told her ail the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interesel of Aubrey; arid often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful female to prolong her existence once after the following months, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at her by such fanlasms and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe took away the names of old men, who had at last detected a living being among them, after several of tholr close to parents were found badly marked with the tame of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, she begged him to believe her, for he was bad, noticed, that those who had dared to doubt their existence, always had a proof of givon, which forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess this was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her harrors multiplied, hearing a fairly precise description af Lord Rulhven; however, he persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in the fears hor, lh0ugh at the time when he wondered about the many cornercjderics that all tended to excile a belief in Lord Ruthven's fupernatural power lbe.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted wilh all the virtues affected 0f the womeri among whom he had sought for his vision of love, won his hell; and while he ridiculed the idea of a wig man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, stjI found him more and bit attached to the almoft fajry sorm before him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a p1an for some antiquary research, he left, dissuaded not to return until her object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that saw only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same welcome of frank children he had known the first time. Sbe cll seemed to separate from him with reluctance; but it was the use boca fhe had no lorig with which she could visile her favorite haunts, wbilst her guardian was busy sketching or discovering irig some fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subjcct of Vampyres, and they bollh, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with even dwarf horror. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to continue his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when TBey heard the name of the place, he begged him all at once not to return at night, for he necessarily had to spend the thrugb a wood, where no Greek remained, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as the imminent vpon who dared to search their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to devour them from the idea; bul when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood shaken, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his uncluttered excursion; he was surprised to absorb the melancholy face of his hosl, and was appalled that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such terror. When he was lowered to leave, Ianthe came to lc slde of his horse, and bitterly begged Oshim to come back, the night was allowed tho power of these beirigs to put in action;—hc promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not see that the daylight was about to end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly gclther inlo a tremend0vs mass, and poured out all the rabies of stuttering on the devious country.—He, however, finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up with the asphalt for his delay: but he was too lal. The twilight, in the cliinates of the south, is the most unknown; immediately the sun sets, the nig ht begins: and the ore ho had advanced far, the power of the storm was clbovo—they echoirig tbunders had barely a resting inlerval—lts thick brittle rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue ljthning seemed to fail and radiate to his feot itself. Suddenly his horse was afraid, and he was transported with terrible speed through the tangled forest. Finally, the animol, through the faligue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly lifted himself from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood that overwhelmed him. Demonstrating, he approached, hopirig to find someone to guide him to the city, or at least to have confidence to get a shelter srom the coat of the storm. As he objected, the thunders, for a silent moment, moved him away from hearing the draconian cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation, exulted with a laugh, continued in oria almosl uribroken sound; — he began to awaken; but, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut to be opened. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, the screaming, guided him. He did not understand, for although he had set down, the sounds continued, and nothing was made of him. He found him in the eontact with someone, who seized himself immediately; and a v oce cried out, \"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt overwhelmed by him who seemed superhuman: determined to sow life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was vain: he was lifted up from the buffalo and threw a great deal of force against the ground: — his encmy threw himself up, and knelt in his chest, had put his hclnds on his throclt—wherei the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; — he rose up unshakeably, and, throwing his prey, rushed into the door, and for a moment the crclshing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was not heard. The storm was not still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soori heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thalk took care of each straw with heavy soot flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they made sure for the one who had attracted him to his thunderstorms; he left himself again in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torthcs burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful c0nductress brought iri a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his dislocated jmmclgination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, stretchod by hls fide. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on the face of the hcr who seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there: — on his neck and chest was blood, and on his thraat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: — to this men pointed, shouted, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre! A vampire!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside the hor, which had recently been the object of so many brilliant and fetish visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died the wilhin. He did not know what he thought — his mind was inflamed and was aware of shuri's reflection, and took refuge in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand a bare dagger of a particular coristruction, which was poorly found iri the hut. The various parties that had engaged in the area of the wbom Ber, a mother had missed, met soon. Their lamentable crying, af they approached the eity, warned the parents of a lucid catastrophe. \"To describe their sorrows would be impossible; bvt when they ascerated the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, a wave pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsola61e; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed wos seized wilh cl the most violent fever, ond was often deliriaus; in these intorvals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by healthy inaccourable combination ho seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the sick on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Athens, and, srom some rnotive, hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same hoof, and became his constant companion. The latter recovered from the delirium bis, he was horrified and began to see the one whose image he now had combined with that of O Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled hlm to the presence bis. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he no longer appeared as an apathetic being who had marveled so much Aubrey; but as soon as his bcgan convalescence was rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the old mon, except that sometimes he was surprised to grind his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation p1aying on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Rvthven was apparently engaged in monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in the interference of the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the still sun;—in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's spirit, by this shock, was weakening, and this elasticity of the spirit that had so distinguished him now seems to have become blunt forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe st0od by hift side – if hc sees him in the woods, his light step seems to be woride in the middle of the undergrowth, in qvest of the modest violet; then suddenly blushing, would show, to his wild imagination, pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He was determined to make beautiful scenes, all the seams of which created bitter assemblations in the mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had stood by the tendor that he had taken care of him during his illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They went in all directions, and searched for all the places to which a memory should be attached; but although they had thus taken their place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to blur these relationships, which they imagined only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of tbose that they had removed from supposed dangers. Consequently, by neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, they traveled once with only a few guordf, moro to serve as a tban guide as defense. When entering, archever, a small narrow deflate, at the bottom of which wcls the bed of a torrent, with masses of lclrge of r0ck descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reclsori ta repente la negligence; for almost the whole party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were slart1d by the beating of bullets near their head, and 6y tbe echoes report of several cannons. In an instant, their guords had left them, and, placjng behind the rocks, had started the fire in the direction from which the part came. Lord Ruthven arid Aubrey, iinjtating their example, retired for a moment behind the glimmer of the faith; but shameful to be so distracted by an enemy, who with jnsvlting shouls 6ade they advance, and to be exposed to non-res-\nIf the thieves rushed up and took them to the rear, they would once delegate themselves to the enemy, in fear of the enemy. He had barely lost the shelving of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the help or his own peril, one soon surprised by seeing the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was dumped, impenetibly cast their arms and handed over.\nBy pr0misef of a great reward, Avbrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded fried t0 a nearby hut; and having accepted vpon a ransom, he wos rio more disturbed by tbeir presenoe — they are only t0 keeping the entrance until their currency returns with the promised sum, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthuen was rapidly lost; two days of mortiflcal iri followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been the object of it; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind apparently became vneasy, and his icec often fixed on Aubrey, which was induced t0 to offer the assistance bis more than the ordinary atrium—\"Help me! You save me – you can da morc that – I don't mean my lifo, I listened to the death of my existence once as little as tot of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\"How? What do you mean? I would do anything,\" Aubrey said. \"I need, but little, of my eb6s apace life, I can't explain everyone, but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if Rny Doath was unknown for the time of somo in England, I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, waking up from an exultant violence: \"Swear that your whole soul, through all nature fear, resents swcar that, for one year a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to a living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases: \"I swear!\" Sajd Auhrey, he made fun of his pill and stopped breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, hut did not go away; the many Circvmstances waiting for hjs acquaintonco with this man rose up on his mind, and he knew why nat; when he resumed his oath, a cold calvary came upon him, as if of the presence of something horrible awaiting him. When a thief met him, he informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been transmitted by his arid comrades, at his retirement, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise he had made to bis Lordship, that he should be exposed to his first cold ray of the moon rising at the back of his death. Aubrey astonished, and taklng several tbe men, determined t0 to go and bury jt on the place where he was. But, which he had molested at the top, he found no trace of elther the corpse or clothes, although the rabbis swore that they had reported the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was bewildered by conjugations, but he finally swollen again, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which we had mct with such terrible misfortunes, and iri that all apparently conspired for hoighten that superstiti0us shot melancholy had grasped on his mind, he resalved to leave him, we soon arrived at Smyrncl. While waiting for a ship to compete with him in Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects that he had in bad mood, belonging to Lord Ruthven. This was a case involving criminal, maro or less appropriate screreal weapons to ensure the death of the victim.\nIm. Thcre were several daggers and atoghans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastcning t0 getting more evidence, he sounds tbe weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adjusted, although particularly chapcd, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes sowed your do not need furthcr certainty — they seemed to look at the being bound to the dagger; but still hc did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on thohaft and sheath were aljke in the splendor on both, and did not leave r0om to doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lefl Smyrna, and on the way back from hjs, in Rome, his first incursions were corcerting the lady whom he had attempted lo snatch of the sedvctivo arts of Lord Ruthven. His inclinations are in distress, their fate is ruined, and it has not been heard since the departure of the seigneury bis. Aubrey's spirit became almast hroke under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer 0f Ianthe. Hc became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the posliions, as if he were going to save the life of someone whom he had made. He came to Calais; a brceze, who seemed obedient to his will, soon tied him on the English coasts; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and, for a moment, he appeared to lose, iri, the embraces and caresses of his siphon, all memory of the past. If she beforo, by her infantile caresses, won her cffection badly, now that the begari woman to appear, she was even more attached cls to c0mparijon.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the ga2e and the applause of the salon assemblage. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the kneading atmosphere of a crowded clpartmcnt. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mjnd below. There was a melancholy choir on this subject which seemed not to be born of an evil, but of a feeling inside, which seemed to indignant a conlictuous soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, wandering where 'or a butterfly or a color can hang—jl was sedate arid perishive. When alone, his Facio was never illuminated by the smile of joy; bul when her brother breathed her affection, arid in his prosence would forget these griccs She knew that he had destroyed his reft, who could have exchanged his smile for the voluptuous one? It seemed that these eyes,—lhat sace werc then play in the light of their ancestral native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, it had been thought by her guardian that her presentation should be delayed until her brother moved away from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was therefore now that it was resolved that the next salon, which opens quickly, should be the ep0cb of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to remain in the manfion of his fathers, and fed on the melanoboli that had defeated him. He does not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his evil spirit was so torn by the euents that he had witnessed; but be prevented from sacrificing his own consolation to the protection of the hif sister. They soon came into town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arinouriccd as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a hcld salon was not held for a long time, and clll was eager to rest in the kingship's smile, bastened thither. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was stretching himself in a corner 6y bimself, without anything around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—suddenly feeling beset by the tho arm, and cl voice hc recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He did not have much to do, fearing to see a spectre that blaslbirn, that he pcrceived, a little distano, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place vpon bis first entry into society. He looked until his members almost refused to wear their weigbt, he was forced to take the claw of a friend, and forcing a passagc through the crowd, he threw himself in a jnto bis car, and was taken home. He clung to the room with hu rized steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — cjrcumstances began iri terrible picture — the dclgger — his oath.—He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — death rises again!—He had his imagination conjvred vp the image on which his mind is resounding. It was impossible for jt to be real — so he did, again, g0 in society; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he failed to get the inf0rmation. He left a few nights later with his sister to try the assembly of a neor relalion. Leaving his wife the work of a matron, he withdrew to a corner, and there he did his own devouring blows. Perceived, ot 1ast, tbat mony were leavjng, he shook himself, entering another room, found his sister surrouled by several, apporting seriously conversatjon; he tried to pass lo arid approach her, when the one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to hi in these traits he most clborrod. And he went to his sister's arm, and in haste he went to the street; and at the door he began to take hold of the host of the servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was rabid to pass them, he heard the voice that came near to him: «Remember your oath!»\nAubrey became distracted alrnost. So before his mind was absorbed by a sub-joct, how many more camp1etely was absorbed, now than thc oertainly of the monster's life once again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's atlentions were now vnheeded, and it was in vain that she inlrea ted hiinto explaln to her which had caused bis condvct abrupt. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oalh began it;—was he then to allow this monster to wander, running over his breath, in the midst of a dear one, and did not have his progress? Hjs very sister migbt were at 0vched 6y him. But even if he broke his oath, and djsclosed his sufpieioris, who would believe it? He thought he was using his own hand to free the world from such misery; but Dealh, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, ho remained this state; murmured his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his caïne sister, wh0, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his good, to support nclture. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from street to strcet, anxious to steal this image that invaded him. His dress ruined, and he wandered, as often exposed your thc n°0n-day suri as to the humidity of the middle neighborhood. He was no longer recognized; he first read with lhe évenerig at home; but finally he deposited it for resl wherever fatigue took hiin. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peoplc lo to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who was running away from a pursuer faster than any thought. His brain, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that by his absence he left all his frieds, with a fiend among them, whose presenco they were unconscious, he decided to engage again in society, and looked at him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, that the Lord Rulhuen was intimately ostracized. But when he entered a room, his burger and his crackling l0oks were so striking, his interior trembled so visible, that his slster was finally begged to refrain from seeking, for her, the society that infected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his rnirid would be alienated, they thought it was high time to take over agclin trot trvst, who had already imposed vpon by Aubrey's parents.\nIn order to save him from the wounds and suffering he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a physlcian to reside in the house of Tbe, and to constantly take care of Hiin. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completeIy was his mind absorbed hy a terrible subjcct. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his ohamber. That's where he was often an ie for days, unable to pass out. He had been emaciated by the bee, his eycians had reached a glazed chandelier;—even if only a sign of effect and memory which dissipated at the entrance of the sister hjs; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing hordes hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he desired that she should not punish him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim, if your love for me is great, don't come near him!\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was: \"True! Trve!\" And again it rings in a state, from which it could not even roam hjm. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guclrdians observed, that the secular times in the day he counted on his fingers a dofinite number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, onc of his tutor entering his room, began to corvette with the doctor vpon the melancholy clrcumstanoe of Aubrey's being in such a clumsy situation, when his sisler went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with anxiety whom. Happy with this indelective return mark, while they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the riam of the Count of Marsden. He was a young Earlwbom with whom he had mct in society, A ubrey seemed happy, and assumed them stronger by expressing his intention to be present al the nvptials, and eager to see his sister. Thoy didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the insluence of his pretty smile; for being pressed to breech, and kissing his cheek, wet with leeches, flowjng to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all his wonderd warinth, and to congloute her on his marriage with a phrson so disconcerted for rank and every accomplishment; when hc suddenly perceived a medallion on ber 6reclst; open it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who had so long jnfluenced his lifo. Hc sei2a p0trtrait in a paroxysm of rabies, and pietina under the foot. On her asking hjm why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future hvsband, he looked as if he had understood it riot—then grab his hands, and look at her with a frantic expression 0f Countnarico, he told her to swear that she would never marry this morister, for he—but he did not covet the advance—it seemed that this v0icc bale remembered his oath—he turned with dismay, thinking that Lord Ruthveri was near him but saw no one. In the same sense the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought that this misfortune was only a return of his trouble, entercd, and the forcir of Miss Aubrey, discouraged him from leaving him. He fell upon his brothers to them, implored, he begged to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, took possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvon had called to the morning after the draw-ro0m, and had been refused with each e1se. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he easily understood it; but when he learned that ho was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among wham he had won this irformation. He relied on the use of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great affection for the most inlerant brother iri bis destiny, he graduated 1ly won the ear 0f Mjss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hlstongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of bjmself as an individual havirig n0 sympathy with ony being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom to address hlmself;—could say how, sinco being known, bis existence, had looked worthy of preservation, if it were not shot he could ljften to his soothing accents;—iri fine, hc knew so well how to use the art of the serponl, or such was the will of the fal, that he gained his affections. He obtained an important embassy, which was used as an excuse for having hastened the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state) which was to place Tako on the very day of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left 6y the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servanls, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a poper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to the sister of hls, conjvrant, os she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of lhose now in the grave, wbo once being she in the arms of lhejr as their hope and the hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The drafts promised that they would unlock it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought it would be better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind further by, what he considered, the raviars of a maniac. The night spent with rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Au6rey heard, with a dread of horror can moro easily be conceived as described, tho ntes of bufy preparatiori. Marning has come, and the sound of the tiles is braked on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servans at lclst overcame vigilance, they ruined it, leaving it in the custody of a defenseless woman 01d. He seized the opportunity, with a b0vnd was out of the room, and in a momonte was found in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, shouted him out of the room, without ardour. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his row: \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee by day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile!\" So, he said, he pushed him to the assistants, who, wrinkled by the old woman, came to pick him up. Aubrey could no longer stand himself; his rage found no vent, had broken a discharge vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his slster, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the husband 1eft Loridon.\nAubrey'f weakness iricreasod; blood tho cffuslon produced symptams close to the dealh approach. He wanted the guardians of his siscrat to be called, and when the midnight ovr had passed out, he would tell in a composite way what the reader could peruscd, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they stopped, it was too lonely. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON, &c.\n\"The world was in front of him, where lo choose his place of rest, ouid Providecnce his guidance.\"\nIn Sajling lhrovgh the Greek Archipelago, on board one of the ships of the majesty bis, in the year 1812, we pul lnto the port of Mitylene, in the lhc island of the name of tbat. The interest of this place, and the supply of certclin of cattle and vegetables still to have there, indvce mary Brihlsh vossel to visit it, both the men of war and merchant; and although it is instead on the way for the ships holding ta Smyrna, its premiums reimburse amply for the deviation of a voyage. We usually landed at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to work at the grubbing-up, and the handbag for the cattle of the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself to the cave called Hamer's school, and other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek cls our guide, who told us that he had come to Scio with a Lord Erigle, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and he would have lacquered me with him; but I did not have the chaos to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. Hc was a weird man, but very good. He left him an old man in charge: he gave Dominic, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him, (about L250 evrence English,) and resided here about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails very often in his foluca towards the various islands.\"\nThis story exalted our curiosity, and we did not have time to hasten in the house where our compatriot had settled. We were graciously received by a mcln of O1d, who co-located us on the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bed-r0om, with an attached spaci0us closet. They all have a fine decor: green waltzes, a marl table on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain below, which cuvld bc mclde to play the bronchi by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a tilting cl posture; a large euch or sofcl completes the smoke. In the room there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, rior a single painting. The bedohamber is only a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow, the common bed tbroughovt Greece. We obsessed with a rebose of marble, formerly, the old renan told us, dragged by books of papors, who were then in a great sailor ohesl iri the closet : it was open, but we did not think we could justify ourselves by examining the content. On the recof tablet, the works of Voltoire, Shakespeare, Boileau, Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimrnerman, in the language of Gcrman Languclge; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Katzebue; the play of Sehi1ler of Robberf; the Parodise Lost of Milton, an Itcllian edition, printed in Pclrma in 181O; several small brochures fr0m thc Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but rio Eng1ish book of any description. Most of these bo0ks are filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin ond. Mossia was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on wbich were also remarks.\nOld Tho said: \"The Lord had read these books in the evening either before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, says ho, they must lie there until his return; for he is so special, if I move unthlng without order, he would frown the ine for a togethor weck; he is otherwise very good. I once made a seruice bim; and I booed the product af this farm for the trouble of taking oare from him, except for twenty zeophines which I pay to an old Armerii who resides in a small collage in the wood, arid which the lord brought here from Adrianoplc; I do not know for which son rea.\"\nThe crowding of the house outside was pleasant. The front porch wcls fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture,) were considerably hlegher lhan the roof. The roof, surrounded by a bcllustrade of light stone, wcls covered with a fine turcoy carpet, under an awning 0f of strong coarse linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pass their venngsin smoking, drinking light wi nes, like \"lachryma christi\", catirig frvit, and enjoy the evenirig breeze.\nOn the left, as we had done, a small streetlet glissa, grapes, orariges and lime were alongside each other on its edges, and under the bank of two bushes of myrtle largo, a marble seat with an ommental wooden back placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, praying, for he was very fervent, and gliding our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\nTobe seen from this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in b1oom, set on the ummil whose ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small strearn lssuirig srom the ruins descerided in broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the waods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, Finishes the view in front; and a butterfly on the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, studdirig tbe light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a viowmore than I did; but our cnquiries were without results as to the name of the person who misresided in this kingly solitude: no one has kriew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could say so, but I'm sure he'll riot,\" \"and can't you say it, old money?\" \"If I can,\" he said, \"I don't dare.\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, we went back to the city, we had several pclticules in the name of the Lord. He had taken a portion of young girls when he was last on the island, and had a dance with them at the nuptial feasl. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and hc often gave Greek Testaments to the paor chi1drcn. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have gathered, to have been a very eocentric and benevolent charactor. A circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend at home teangt is capable of not revealing. He had a daughter of the most beautiful, whom he often saw walking on the shore, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with whicb that we separated from the peaceful island 0f Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this crawler in Greee could be. Hc hcld money it was obvious: he hcld disposition philanthropy, and all these eccentricities that mark particular gonius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling jn company wilh M. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATT'S, who had been on a trip to Egypt and Greece, \"The individual, he says, on whom you are anxious, is Lord Byron; I met hlm in my trips to the island of Tenedos, ond I alsa uisted il in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his seigneury, as we had been at the srom house for a few years; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in each pagc. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curi0us in our research at the cottage, but we have comforted our resolves with the idea of returning to MityIene on a future day; but to be reborn that day will never return. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in juvstice in the right name of her seigneury, who has hoeri grossly slandered. He's been describ...\nreads as an insensitive disposition, inverse to association with human nature, or oontributjrig in any way to appease his sorrows, or strange to his pleasures. The fact is direct in the opposite, as can be clearly gathered fram these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly unfolded in the seigneury's poems, seem to have their seat in his b0som. Tenderncss, syinpatby, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courting of the reboso 0f solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a bei ng on whose heart the Religion put his merI, and on whose head Benevolerice hcltb threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a counselryman. With respeot to his rents or his pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an ari opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself before a horrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrere-mortcll. Lord Byron's character is the wortby of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testion of a virtuoso and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END\nGillet, Prinler, Crown Court, Fleet-Slreet."

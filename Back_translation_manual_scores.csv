THE superstition on which this story is smiling is uery general jn the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, he did not extend his sons to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he assumed his present somme only from ",2,"es. No man can read the previous pleasant ""trails"" that feel proud to be proud as a castingman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of man; an",5,"lf in a terrible court where all muft apprehension, only can censor the errors of a confrere-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and flouting the applause of the world, is the testimony of the virtuous and self-approving conscience.

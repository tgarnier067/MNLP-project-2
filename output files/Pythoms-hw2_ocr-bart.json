    "0": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this was founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a human body could not recover if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, till extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West its occurred, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the houses existed, that peculiarly imitated a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of strangulation; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the deep pores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certair de Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been compelled to say that, at Cassovia, on the fringes of the Turkish service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the disease, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This punishment, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre again; and, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of being tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cafes of purism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptions, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and unfiltered blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the chest and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have screamed out dreadfully as is he had been shot. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously suffered from melancholy, lest they should, in their turn, become jealous of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChase Bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the prisoner's servations than any other resistance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not entirely doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal vices solely to the beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affection and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut here on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corſe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the new place, and suck the life out of all thy race; There shall be thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet at the banquet which perforee must feed thy livid living cſes, The victims, when they yet expirc, shall know the demon for the devil fire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flower are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must not fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel, thou must end thy task and inark Her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which frees her lifeless body; Then with unballowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock of her brother Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Memorial of her agony! Yet with thine own hands blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bagging lip; Then striking to thy sullen gravestone, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, till the world in horror shrinks away from place more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey was also intraduced in his wild and beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the favourite coronation of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting her husband, whom she best loved whilst in exile. All this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful habits of her life, she being presented through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The correspondent Tournant gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his considerable work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian evil.\nMany curious and intresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, hardly devoted to explanation, and which may now be concurred with by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucocha, Vardouacba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the village partles one of the leaders of the ton anobleman, and marked for his singularities, the man who ran it. He gazed upon the mirth arrayed him, as if he could not part from therein. Apperently, the light laughter of the fair maiden attracted his attention, that he might by a loud shout quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not help laughing when it arose: some attrihuted the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the eye with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having someone in their preserice capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which sometimes gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its form and outline were beautiful, many of the male hunters after marriage attempted to win his attentions, and show, to him, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his attention:–though in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apperently fixed upon her's, until it seemed as though they were unperceived;–evidently her unappalled expression was baffled, and she left the room. But though the prosecutrix could not ascertain ever the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to men. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as esteemed among those females who form the boast of the sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died when he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary authorities, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with misfortune, and thought that violence was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and ruffian: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striking which was the least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters.\nBut at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, they led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ramble of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presencence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in his life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Failing, however, some compensation in the gratified vanity, he was about to relish his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstance we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the virtual impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of all contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slanted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the subject of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the persons that besore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was observed. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desiré of gaining some information respecting this mysterious character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the act, which for many generations has been considered necessary to enable young men to take some rapid steps in the career of men towards putting themselves upon an equality with the governed, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies,whenever such intrigues are mentoned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pique, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. -\nBy such a mark of affection for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waterf.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his contemporaries were exposed to his conduct, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the voracious, reduced to iridity by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuosity, that he besought his cocks; these were sent from his door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate man should ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was nothing more than pure in his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the abyss, or sunk to the lowest and the most abominable depths. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the entertainment of all fashionable vicars; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless offspring of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracledness of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, curling, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat bitterly, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenœe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy the present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conulsive grasp of the innuent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of overturning the eunning of the more unscrupulous.\nMURDERER. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of his life, and did not belong to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and when Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of secretly wishing to break the rickety, which in his exalted imagination seemed to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost drowned child. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing not only but affection; the others were from his friends, the latter astounded him; if it had ever entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresolute powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been contended, that his contempt for the female had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to increase his gratification, that her husband, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vinous virtue, dowry to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fact, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detained upon leaving one, whose companion had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circulations pass by unnoticed. He entered into the room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is custom that an unmarried female is met with in secrecy; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his winding, and soon discovered that an affair had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him in his intents to pay respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his feelings were such as he supposed they would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must discharge accompany his lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the sister of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely wrote to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of an old glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden them beneath the sheltering soil or many cooured lichen. Under the same roof as he himself, experienced a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have served the model for a pincer wishing to pour tray on caravans the promised hope of the pious in Mahomet's palace, but that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plank, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of creature; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxuriant look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Bengal bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had first decamped up to an almighty effaced spot, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could not escape from his memory the very object he had before him of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memoranda for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youth memory, the marriage pomp which she remembered viewing in her irascibility; and then, turning to subjects that had evident had a greater imprimatur upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talcs of her nurse. Her appearance and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living monster, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest companions, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely girl, to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idiotic and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of several old men, who who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and as it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giving them, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in persisting her, that he could see some truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondred at the many coincidences which had all tended to induce a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her appearance, so contrasted with all the afflicted virtues of the women among whom he had so vaunted his vices of romance, won his heart; and when he rid himself of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached and more attentive to her almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseal, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the things around him, when first in his mind he retained an identity that seemed to him the rightful possessor of his things. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insensible being he had first known. She always seemed to withdraw from him with reluctance; but it was becaufe she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some secret which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeaused to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with some apprehension, affirmed their existence, but with horror at the very name. Shortly after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once be warned of him not to return at night, as he must pass through a wood, where no one would ever remain, and the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the return of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to frighten them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to learn that his words, mocking the folly of those horrid fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, for night allowed the power of these beasts to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come, and that on the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer company, so rapid gather into a tremendous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, bow ever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediate after the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the starm waded above—the echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fountained lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse bolted, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, under the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead caves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the other side, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silen, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, contending in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He followed him in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in company with someone, whom he immediately recognized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his wife as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat; when the glare of several torches penetrating through the hole which gave light in the day, disturb him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in consequence the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The fire was now out; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those about. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mounds, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress lying in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a visjon arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her body that seemed almost as absorbing as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly formed, and Anne was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had long resided within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constriction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of a child whom a mother had missed. Their loud cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; they died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most virulent fever, and was often delirious; at intervals he would leap upon Lord Ruthven, and upon some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former compunction to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecise maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destrayer. LATEST. Rutbven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of the man whose image he had now collided with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, pledging his most repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His demeanor seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his symptoms began to become rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of melancholy, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, and a smirk of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smilo had him.\nHe discharged him. During the last fortnight of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was scarcely engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breozo, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless fun; and, indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyef of all.\nAubry's mind, by this time, was much changed, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Horseshoe; if he sought it amids the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering among the underwood, in quest of the mother violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded hands, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crated such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but when they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually learned to slight the reports, which they believed were only the invention of individvals, whose interest it was to excite the passions of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus following the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torront, containing large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the shooting of bullets close to their heads, and by the sudden report of cavalry guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had started to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthn and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment towards the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting remarks bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take hold in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they reached the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the call or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him, the guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of real reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's wife rapidly deceased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed approaching with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the occurrences about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usucll earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my father as much as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's happiness. \"How? Tell me how? I would do any thing,\" replied. Aubrey. --\"I need not much—my life ebbs apace—I cannot explain the whole—but if you would conceal all you know from me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth.\" If my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exuberant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seamed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nHe retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered him a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something terrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robbber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been communicated by himself or his comrades, upon retiring, to the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should not be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose above his head. Aubrey afterwards apprehended, and taking several of his men, determined to go and lay it upon the spot where it fell. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identicolous rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that he had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a courry in which he had met with many terrible misfortune, and which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapled to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently oramented in the same style as the one covered in the fatal blood–he shuddered–hanging to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his joy may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed almost to be bound to the dagger; still, he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rochester, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victor to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed abedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he proceeded to the mansions of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantin caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, he was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had riot that winning smile which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her face was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which strays whence a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alive, her face was never brightened by the smile of jay; but when her brother died-\nHe gave to her his affection, and would in her presence forget all the griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her happiness for that of the unhappy? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, concluded that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"big scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed up with the insanity which overpowered him. He could not feel interessed about the habits of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so tormented by the events he had witness; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the splendour of royally, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, completely unaware of all about him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized toowell, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fear of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice of this spot upon his first entry into so cité. He went till his limbs almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and foreing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and put his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances star-\nHe came up in dreadful array–the dagger–is oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image while he was asleep.\nIt was frowned upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurling upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Praising, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest company; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revelled in him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, led her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, reached home.\nAurey became most distracted. If hitherto his mind had been occupied by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the prisoner's verdict again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt departure. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His action startled him; was he really to allow this monster to roam, beclinging ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its consequences? His very sister might have been tauched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from floor to floor, anxious to fly that image which had haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no gentleman to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer more than any—from thought. His conduct, however, sudderly charmed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to come back into society, and watched them closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, the society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved necessary, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had frequently encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take consular care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence was at once so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of interest and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the appearance of his sister; then he would suddenly start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would order her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, do go for him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohereances became less frequent, and his mind seemed to shed off a portion of its gloom, which, his guardians observed, when certain hours in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and smile.\nThe lime had nearly elapsed, when, on the first day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Ambrose's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young Earl whom he had met with in company, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be presen at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him. He was evidently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, which was wet with tears, fluttering at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted friends, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long occupied his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramped it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then grasping her hands, and gazing on her with a suantic expression of consternation, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if someone's voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered.\nBy and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, and begged of them to leave him, but for one day. They, attesting to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by cousin attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and sister in his life, he gained the ear of Miss Avrey. Who could resist his power? He could speak of him as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his affection, had been begun to seern worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing sentiments; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, by which he gained her affection. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important position, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before her departure for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was seized by the physician and his guardians, endeavoured to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, comforting her, as she valued her own happiness, her own home, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few days that marriage, on which he had inflicted the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would discharge it; but giving weight to the physicion, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the screams of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubry grew almost français. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, and they gradually slole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried away from the scene, speechless with rage. When on the case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my ride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So continuing, he pushed him towards his friends, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his ragged breathing vent had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he arrived, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related conjecturedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe Germans hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disclosed, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1882, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and although it lies rather out of the way for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who must remember the unhappy days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pauper,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to go to Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mantle in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constant; for he is in his condition very much to the contrary.\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had returned. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, rarble tablcs on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotlon quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we discovered a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a young seaman's chest near the close: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet in the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rausseau's works compendium; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; M'Lton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was liberally scrawled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which all were remarking.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to do one thing without orders, he would frown upon us for a week together; but he is also very good.\" I owe him a service; and I have the produce of the farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings, which I pay to an aged Armenian who lives in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought back from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasurable. The portico in front was fifly paces wide and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with half-planking and fretwork capitals, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were confiderably bigger than the others. The roof, surrounded by a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tertiary earpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses-tops are furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a splendid streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed most of his evenings on Sundays till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" replied the old man, \"praying\" for he was very sick.\nHe \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcis, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestio decay. A great stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, and was followed by the woads of the mourning's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, through a vista of lofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distantly observed, contrasting the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a drink more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenians,\" said the conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not intended to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamonts to his many children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very ecoentric and benevolent character. On circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the court thought proper not to disolve. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lad was often seen walking on the sea-bore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaeful isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler from Greece might be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccenologicalities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. In compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chichester Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in that page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we cornered ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been characterised as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its fears, or add to its measures. The fact is directly the reverse, and may be happily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feasts of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whom heart Red Cross bath set her seal, and over whose head Divine Providence hath thrown her inontle. No man can recollect the preceding commanding \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a cavalryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution.\nFor, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and be he who dares to defend himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, he may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscierice.\nTHE END.\nGillett, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "1": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE SPECTRATION upon which his tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arahians it appears to be extinct: it did not, however, extend to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a human body could become extinct if married in their church, it gradually irreased, and formed the subject of many wondrous stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it occurred, though with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the disease existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; while these hum an blood-suckers fattened—and their chests became distended in such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurghary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and emphatically informed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say that, at Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This caution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, out twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tortured by him, and a deposit was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and unfiltered blood. Proceedings having been thus obtained, they were returned. Reserved to the accustomed custom. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have groaned as dreadfully as if he had been stabbed. When they found him, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. Some masquerade masks were adopted upon the corses of some persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vompyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief balliff.\nThis monstrous crime is here related, because it seems better adapted to justify the purpose of the present services than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal appetites solely to those beings he loved in person while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serjeant, thy corse shall from its head be rent; Then ghastly aunt the devil will pace, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforates; Must feed thy livid living corsces, Thy victims, when they yet expire, I know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. The one who for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, God bless thee with a father's name— That word will wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glaze which must view which free her from its lifeless blue; Thou must also tear the locks of her yellow hair, which, in lifc a lock when Abraham's fondest pledge was worn, But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thy own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggings.\nThen speaking to thy fullness gravo, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than thou.\nMr. Southey was also introduced in his somewhat but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being possessed throughout the whole of the life of a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of some astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmot, in his great work on this subject, befides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrations illustrative of its effects, but put forth some learned dissertations, attempting to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and mosteresting notices on his singularly horribel superstition must be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a book necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations of a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the merchants of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the world around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the woman only attracted his attention, that he might by a chance seize it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt the sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the oblique's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leader so heavy upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence, and now feasted the weight of ennui, were pleased at having him in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the doadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters of his notoriety attempt to win his attentions, and gain, at least, same in terms of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on her dress as a mantle, to attracl his notice:–tough she tried in vain:–when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was borne, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the gaze of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent cautery with which he spoke to his virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it aroused the dread of his singular companions, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vices, he was as often among the females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among the ones who sully it by their vices.\nAt about the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the session of great sorrow, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the most important charge of his mind to the care of medical subalterns, he cultivated more his intelligence and his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which daily repulsed so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was brought in by Providence merely for the peculiar effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought the misery of a cottage inerely consifted in the vesting of clotts, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variably coloured patches. He bought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering in the gay circles, many motbers surrounded him, striving which should desquerade with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their watching countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the roce of these solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that slickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of ventilation, there was no foundatian in real life for any of the congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludge. Finding, however, some compensation in his degraded vanity, he was about to relaunch his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed scarcely any other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to plunder every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object of his admiration the hero of his own romanco, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advertised upon his notice, that his position was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, until now, had occupied his curiofity, he informed his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to ennoble the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree Her skill was in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his importance to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposol to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, appareritly, had not much in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many aspects of his life were exposed to his view, the results offer different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not refrain from remarking, that it was not from the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtuosity, that he bestowed his gifts; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask money, not to relieve his woes, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, who generally preeminent over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigents. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to ruin, or sunk to the lowest and the first abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Abraham was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashion and vice; the more he entered into a game, the more in the spirit of the table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, unchanged. So when he encountered the rash youthful vice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forn's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the eyes of the cat whilst dallying with the dead mouse. In very town, he left the formerly affluencer youth, torn from the circle he adorned, crying, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single farthing of his own immense wealth, wherewith to buy anything sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately gave first, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this might but be the result of his considerable degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reproach this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and promise which praved the ruin of industry, and did not tend to bring him any profit; but he deferred it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking honestly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, amidst the violence.\nHis appearance, in all wild and rich scenics of nature, was always the same: his eye poked less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance once upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whil he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; for it had been forcibly entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the fury. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was drodfully uicious, for that the possession of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his passion for the adultress had not originated from his hatred of her characler; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her viclim, the part of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those males whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the morals aside, and had not scruplod to expose the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon seizing one, whose countenance had not yet shown a single braggt point upon which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lord Mayor was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with such sociability; he was therefor obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his ways, and so determined that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely result in the ruin of an innocent, thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intent with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lard Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lavished. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must discharge accompanying his Lordhip in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also of the character of his Lordship. The assizes nation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a settlement; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's intrigues.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peri Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed up residence in the house of a Greek; and there occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory up to monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicleing the deeds of freemen so before times, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil of any coloured lichen. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicato, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think they could belong to those who had done foul things. As she danced upon the pinnacles, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for the sleepy luxurrious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the vivacious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kensington butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, fluttering as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tress falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray a delicately brilliant and swift appearance, which might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of with regard to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why tempt to descry charms which we all feel, but none appreciate?–It was jollity, youth, and excitement, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and labour the magic effect of her pencil, in tracing the scenics of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling donkeys upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours of her deep memory, the marriage pomp she rememhered from her infancy; and, turning to subjects which had evidenlly made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her past. Her earnestness and earnest belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years among his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to frighten her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the tales of old men, who, at last detected one lying among them, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Russell; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be some truth in her fears, but at the same time he marveled at the many coincidences which had all tended to incline to a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nHe began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the afflictioned virtue of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he rid himself of the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more, more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he regarded an irnage that seemed alone the rightful possessor of these thaughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him without much reluition; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, which while her guardian was occupied in stealing or urinating some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to return at night, as he would necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the locks had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon those who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, immortal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Avrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melanchaly face of his host, and was alarmed to find that his words, mocking the belies of those horrible fiends, had filled him with fright. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, and last night allowed the power of these being put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the harlequins there was one of the specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the country. He at once, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these sovthern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the powc of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and crackle at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangling forest. The animal at last, half-past midnight, stopped, and he found, by the glare of the setting sun, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead caves and rushes which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him towards the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriek of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which almost rumbled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for when he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in conflict with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by someone whose strength seemed fuperhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he slumbered; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling up upon his breast, had placed his hands on his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapacity of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vapour arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his legs. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was bruising, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–from this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now filled with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had heen sound in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the parents of some dread catastrophe. –To relieve their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAvrey being put to bed was seized with a most intense fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would throw himself upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Cantwell–by some unclandestine combination he seemed to want of his former companion to sparo the ones he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, decided at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and came his cousin to attend him. When the lad recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of the woman whose appearance he had now combined with that of a Vompyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and concern which he showed, soon consolled him to his presence. His demeanor seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic man who had so upset Aubrey; but as soon as his canvassing began to become rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circulating, like our world, the inoveless surface, and he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distressed him seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind would not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had previously frequented, Anthe's form would not be by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he considered himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Glasgow neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and searched every spot to which a recollision could be attached: but when they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually begged to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuis, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the doctor.\nAs usual, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guide than as a defence. Upon entering, howeer, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the head of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring preexisting structures, they had reason to repent their conduct; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had reached them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to flee in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retreated far a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being expensed to unnecessary slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in therear, they decided at once to rush forward into the midst of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Avrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content morely to guard the entrance till their comrade returned with the promiscuous sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapid decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty stops. His complexion and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, he became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the call of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but life–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would consent to all you ask of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–arid if death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with contemptuous violence, \"Swear by all your soul vows, by everything your nature foars, swear that, between a yearend and a day you will not impart the knowledge of my crimes or deeds to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the strange circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and his companions, upon his retiring, on the promise of a neighbour, according to a promise they had made with his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astounded, and together with several of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had made his visit he found no trace of either the corpse or the cloths, but when the robbers came along they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was crowded in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslient melancholy that had seized his mind, he resolued to leave, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Riva. Amongst other things there was a case containing severa weapons of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were considerable daggors and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented with the same silver flyle as the dagger discovered in the farm hut? He shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further examination–they seemed perfectly to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the some peculiar tints up and down, the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on both.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Hearts. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the post-mortem, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted him to the English seas; and he hastened to the mansion of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she hitherto, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded auditorium. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a meloncholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of another realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colossus may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When she was alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed her life, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the prosecutrix? It seemed as if those eyes that face wore then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her principal. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy season.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashion and music, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They remained in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced in a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of those around him, engaged in the remembrance of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognized too well, said, \"Run!\"\nHe whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attrocted his position on this spot upon his first entry into society. He struggled till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of friend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thaughts were bursting from his head. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger was out–He roused him–he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the monster his head was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefor, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask calling Lord Ruthveri, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and here gave himself up to his own devouring spirits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an adjoining room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he compelled to move, turned round, and displayed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by a crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn round, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was almost distracted. If his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrofed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's objections were now respected, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his aberrational conduct. He then uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His next question was: was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, destroying all he held dear, and failing to avert its progress? His very sister has been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He though of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wright; but death, he remembered, had been already moeked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His habits became neglected, and he wandered, as indifferent to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue might look him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to watch him; but they were gradually distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than he thought. His conduct, however, has only changed. Strutting with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and sullen looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Whilst, sometimes, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to intractable, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume all that regulation which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of soving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his travels, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a phyfician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible occurrence. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chair. There he would often lie for days, in fear of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a gassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed was upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes kiss her, and, seizing her hand, with looks which severely afflicted her, he would desire her to follow him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank in a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherencies became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a number, and then smile.\nThe time had long elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, on his guardians entering his room, he began to converse with his physicari upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of turning intellect, of which they felt he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had acquainted with in society, Aubrey felt pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intition to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but said a servant of his sister was with him. He was apparently again somewhat affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her husband's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He begged to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a furious expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would not again wed this monster, for he– But he could not make agreement–it seemed as if the voice again bade. He did not remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a symptom of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this infraction. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretences of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gra-\nHe also won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power?His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he entrusted himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing calls;–in fact, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, that such was the will of fate, that he gained her afflicions. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the soldiers, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, consoling her, as he desired her own happiness, her own horiour, and the happiness of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which he denounced the first heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without resolution to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey read, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubroy grew almastiff. The curiosity of the prisoners at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slopped away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the open passage where all were immediately assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached him, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When in the passage, Lord Ruthven whirled in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath, and know that, if not my bride to day, your servant is dishonored. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his brother, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Lyon.\nAubry's weakness increased; the excessive flow of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desisted his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the treasury of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Gracious Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supposition of cattle and vogetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit – both men of war and merchantmen; and although it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser barging for cattle with the nativcs, the clergyman and myself took a stroll to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left three and four days prior to our arrival with his family. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to go to Constantinople, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, sacing the river, cost sixl. to build, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wool-trader, six hundredl. for it, (about 25l. in English currency,) and has resided here about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—a large receding hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room with a spacious closet annexed. They were all sirply decorated: plain green-slained wood, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountains bath, which could be made to play through the channels by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning position; a largo couch or sofa compleled the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were also mirrors, and a slrigle pointing. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were now in a largemouth seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empire; Zimmerman, in the Germaine language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Lost, an Italian novel, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Grek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The mantle was literally saturated all over, and marked with small slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he came, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one of them without orders, he would frown upon me for a week; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of the farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except two pence a week which I pay to an elderly Armenian who rosides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was puzzling. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pews and fret-work finials, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considered almost higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awriing of very coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks spend their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lochryma christi,\" eating frujt, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lirnes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we learned that the lord passed most of his evenings and nights till twelve a'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A number of rich verges led the eye to Mount Carmona, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The ground was smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terracing the view in front; and A little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-tree, several large islets were distinctly outlined, studding the light blue wave with spots of crescent green. I seldom enjoyed a drink so much as this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his brother, who had gone to court.\n\"The. Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the house we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was stationed upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gives a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Good Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom he was oftenseen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-farte, and taught her himself the rudiments of it.\nThis was the information from which we departed for the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, gvessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposal, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geniuses. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had not then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harwood\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having eighteen more curious in our company at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not wholly uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly insulted. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or contriving in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from these little dates. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his Majesty's poems, ought to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and on whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No one can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before the extraordinary tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in society, and shun the world's applause, is the true testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prisoner, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "2": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Romans it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latins and Greek colonies; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with same slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the custom prevailed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; when these human blood-suckers fattened, and their insides became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that at Cassina, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and covering himself with his blood. This prevention, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, some twenty or thirty days after his death and trial, many persons complained of having been threatened by him, and a deposilion was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases af vampyrism) nude, and entirely free from circulation, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entire through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reputed to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they out of his bead, removed his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tummy.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subjunct of the presont operations than any other circumstance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to make his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by a bond of kindred and affections—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut here on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corse shall from his tomb be rent; Then ghostly haunts the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight from the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed the living corse, Thy victims, when they expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, is cursing them, Thy flowers are wrenched on the stem. The penalty for your crime must first fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Sholl bless thee with a father's name—that word shall wrap thy heart in flames! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a look when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne shamefully by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with your own best blood still drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking from thy sullen grave, Go; and with Gouls and Angles rave, these in horror shrink away from spectre in which accurately described they.\nMr. Southcy was also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented through the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The gentleman Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratiues highly illustrative of its effects, has put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrid superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be corralled by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are severa others synonymous with it, made use of in literature. various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoula, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipation attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the inhabitants of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could participate in it. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those hearts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awc, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one point seemed to pierce through the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house that wished to see him, and those who had been accused to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleaded at having something in their possession capable of engaining their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of melancholy, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline wore beautiful, many of the female bachelors of considerable notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his attention: though in truth she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her. Her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But when the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his wife, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even exceeded the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparition hatred of vice, he was as often among those female who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtuos, as among those who profess it by the vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Avrey: he was an orphan together with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alone himself by guardians, who though it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of mind to the company of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his interests than his judgment. He had, hence, that great romantic feeling of love and candour, which doth ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with him, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought the intimacy of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were more interesting to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dramas of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, soliciting whom they should describe with least truth their flattering or ramping favourions: the girls at the same time, by their brightering countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his domestic hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flicker, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffling, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compunction in his gratified vanity, he was about to renounce his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have admired desisted, crossed a bridge in his career.\nHe watched him; and the virtual impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, but gave only the tacit assent to their existence, impeded by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he thus formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advertised upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from notes of preparation in High Street, that he was about to burgle. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessarily to ennoble the young to take some rapid steps away from the habits of vice towards putting themselves upon an equallty with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of praise or of praise, occording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to marry him. Flattered by such a mark of respect from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with such men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHilherto Avrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results aroused different suspicions from the apparent motives of his conduct. His comportment was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his generosity more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not assist remarking, that it was not upon the unfortunate, but upon themselves, subjected to indigence by their misfortunes. Attendingly, even up to virtue, that ho bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigenes. There was one circumstance under the control of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom he was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aury was surprised at the apparent oagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vioe; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharp-crack was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the rash youthful novoc, or the luckless father of a large family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparerit abstracted from mind was laid beyond, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cal whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat bitterly, amidst the speaking looks of his hungry children, without a single farthing of his own immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling court; but inevitably lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gold he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not but be the result of a certain degree of knowedge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. He often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charley and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity as speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbourn in court, and amidst the varied wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke loss than his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his affection, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imaginings had given him the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter aslonished him; if it had ever entered into his mind that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the accused had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had desired, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtuosity, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apperently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole depravity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose condition had not yet shown a single good point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him mare closely, and to let no slight circumstance pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unm married female is met with in society; he was the before obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of the unfortunate girl. In no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such that he believed all would rejoice upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, he again laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that at that moment he must decline accornanying his Lordhip in the remnder of the proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling on the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lord President. The case was postponed. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his consent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his proposal having been foiled by Aubrey's interpositian.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his ship towards Greece, and crossing the Pelisula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded remains of ancient glory up to monuments that appear, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, but her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the platform, or tripped along the movable side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her creatures; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of a savage nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but not the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unfortunate girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who sometimes forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibiting in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the author, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which only men feel, but men can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and closuty, unaffectioned by crowding-rooins and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effervescent effusions of his penknife, in tracing the outlines of her native place; she would then describe to him the carnival dance upon the open plairi, which she would pair, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp which she recalled viewing in her youth; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest friends, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ongoing months, his blood would run cold, when he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and borrible santasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so insistent, she begged of him to believe her, far it had been, remarking, that those who had dared to question their suspicions, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to believe it was true. She referred to the tradition and appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the superriatural power of Lord Rutven.\nAubrey beguited to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the worn-out woman whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and although he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Eriglish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost sairy form befre him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclaration, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he regarded an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his remains. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could spend it her favourite moments, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they had, without any formal present, affirmed their existence, and expressed with horror at the very name. Soon afterwards, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his operations, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever re main, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the prostitutes for their nocturrial orgies, and denounced the most horrid evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their palaces. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those horrible creatures, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and asked of him to retire, for he had allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he refused. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidy gather into a tremoridous mass, and pour all their fury upon the governed country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whi first the blue fountained lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatality.\nThe storm stopped, and he found, under the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the mounds of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the prying force of the crowd. As he approcheched, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, which lasted in an almost unbroken sequence; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder, which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sourid, however, surrounded him. He was apparently uncereived; for, though he called, still the disturbances continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and be found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his daughter as dear as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The stockin was now lying; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard among those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch lay on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was afterwards left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduct carried in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a dream arising from his disturbed imagination; but he immediately saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her chest and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A crowd was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her husband, who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vislons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held most voluminously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corne. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubry being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in the intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would receive prayers upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, managed at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever reason, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the lad recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had so combined with that of Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance. For the disturbance that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he displayed, soon confined him to her presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breezes, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have flamed for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and seclusion as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; and when he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he found it in, the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly lurning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded hands, with a meek smile upon her lips. He refused to fly scenes, every feature of which created such terrible associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the great care he had taken of him during his illness, that he should visit those parts of Greece he had yet seen. They travelled in a very direction, and visited every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but although they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of rumours, but they gradually began to dismiss the reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a guard. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rock brought down from the mountains.\nAs for the prisoners, they had no right to reproach their negligence; for scarcely was the whole of the party engaged in the conversation, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the excited report of several guns. In an instant the guards had left their posts, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering trees of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detailed by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedig the law or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced him to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring castle; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their commander should return with the promised sum, for which he had given order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days he became unconscious, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconseious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my husband, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would communicate all you know about me, my honour were free from danger in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life.I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violets.\nCross-examined, \"Swear by all your senses, by your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugting upon his pillow, and bawled no more.\nAubroy retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the presontiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber came, and informed him that it was still there, having been conveyed by his soldiers and cousins, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his departure. Aubrey astonished, and together with several of the men, determined to go and bury it up to the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, but the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was lost in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with many terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparitions apparently conspired to heighten the superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several schemes of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut–he shuddered–hastering to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainly—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduction arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from since the departure of his lordship. Aubroy's mind was almost broken under so many repealed horrors; he was afraid that his lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of empires. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were determined to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, wafted him to the English shores; and be hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine charms, had gained his affections, now that the woman begon to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not the kind of grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliance which only exist in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the intelligence of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling wilting, that appeared to indicate a sad conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays upon a butterfly or a coolly agitated animal—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened with the smile of joy, except when her brother breathed to her distress, and was in her presence.\nNever forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes were then playing in the light of their own private sphere. She was yet only eight.\nShe had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, where he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"big house.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the house of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not take interest in the srivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort for the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been described as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and many who were anxiously waiting.\nIf you wish to bask in the smile of royalty, hasten hither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, completely unaware of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognised too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to look, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last forever, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had caught his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs first refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hand upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had made up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefor, to go again into society; but though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the apartment of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired in a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering a nearby room, found his sister surrounded by several, apperently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested not to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang for word, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forced her towards the door: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almast distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one project, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his heart? His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only spoke a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath bound him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing raving upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already meted. For days he remanded in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister come, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, be lest his house burn, he wandered from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he was as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the in-night damps. He was no longer to be recognised; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at once laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were greatly distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the wives of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom in his presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, and his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for her sake, in society which affect him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unsuccessful, the guardian thought proper to interpose, and, feeling that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to remain in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by this terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a gassy luster; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with hooks that severably afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! –if your concern for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" He and his wife sank into a state, whence not even she could rescue him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a pall of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smirk.\nThe time had scarcely elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physicari upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's birth in so awful a circumstance, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of reluming jritollect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking it was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the emotion of her lovely face; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the sight of her brother's being so alive to the pleasures of affection. He began to speak with all his learned warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the woman who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a poroxysm of rag, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deposed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a roturn of his disorder, entered, and forcibly separating him from Miss Aurey, compelled her to leave him. He fell on his knees before them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with no one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He remained to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could ressuret his wife? He could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he dressed himself; could tell how, since he knew she knew him, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were only that he might listen to her foothing accents; in fact, he knew as well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important position, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physioian and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, apologizing her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physic, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on with no word to the poor inmates of the house; and Avrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the sounds of busy preparation. Morrising came, and the sound of carrjages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servitors at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole him in the custody of an old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand flung out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where the bodies were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately opproached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him from the room, speechless with rage. Whilst on the stair case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remembor your oath, and know, if my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed himself towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not stopping, had broken a blood-soil, and he was confined to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he arrived, and the prisoner was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and groom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's governesses might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related publicly what the officer has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had suddenly appeared, and Aubrey's sister had complained the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was a place before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegelables always to be badly, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and rangers; and although it lies rather out of the track for ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We camped, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for contracts with customers, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his castle. \"He employed me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Marylebone, where I was likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has put an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundles of zechines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there out fourteen months, though not consistently; for he sailed in his canoe very often to the different islands.\"\nThe accusation excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were immediately received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a science closet attached. They were all simply decorated: plain grey-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain near it, which could be made to play throng the branches by making a springing fletched in the side of a large window sill and a leaning post; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the comforters being throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were now in a large feaman's chest in the corner: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the drawer lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's works compilations; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobue's novels; Schiller's play of the Rabbers; Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1881; several small pamphlets from the Greek printers at Constantinople, much torn, but no Englische book of any description. A number of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with sills of papor, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the other; but,\" said he, \"here they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of the farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted arble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corrieices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considered much higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was supported by a fine timber carpel, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frittat, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the other hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapcs, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large rose bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oak and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple stood in mclémentio deeay. A small stream arising from the ruins descended in broken cascades, but it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a short distance on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several flowers were distinctly observed, contrasting the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our correspondent, \"could call, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And what can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare call.\" We had not intended to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several parlulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotlon and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new hat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen to the poor children. In short, he appeased.\nHe appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage bought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-sorte, and taught himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, conjecturing who the rambler in Groce could be. He had money it was evident: he had generosity of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, and our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company witb Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had not heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcline in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylone on same future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in jest to my lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is quite the reverse, as may be plairily gathered from those little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegant and dopicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their spot in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy.\npathy, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repose of sombreitude is an additional reason for marking him as being a man whose heart Religion hath set her seal. Over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding preceding pleas begging \"traits\" with without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give on opinion. Reports are ever to be received with censure, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortician. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, away from the world's attention, is the supreme testimony of a virluous heart and an unquestioning conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "3": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstilion upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the belief becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their terrilory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead arising from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautified. Inthe West it spread, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the disease existed, the vampyres invariably imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suokers fatten.\nTheir veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credulous account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the counsel-in-chief and magistrates on the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certajn Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had come to say, that at Cassouia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tortured by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by cutting some of the earth out of the vampsyre's grave, and covering himself with his blood. This provocation, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vompyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been poisoned by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attentions. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, picked up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, almost entirely free from corruption, and containing at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and holy blood. Proof having been thus obtained, he resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven almost severally through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reported to have crumbled out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burried his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the consent of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, that they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who suffered from it.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nCrown bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observances than any other instance which could be adduced. In as much as Greece is considered as a land of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those friends he loved most upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyrene, your corse shall from its tomb be re-born; It will ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, who yet expire, shall know the demon for their soul; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The yungest, best loved of all, shall bless thee with a sister's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy gaze which must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand must tear The tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is born away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with his own best bled shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then talking to thy father in the grove, Go; and with Gouls and Angles rave, till the crowds in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian queen Oneiza, who is repressed as having returned from the grave for the purpose of remonstrating him she best loved while in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she having passed throughout the course of the tale af complete purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have borne an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, comprising a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effets, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a clicetic, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general use, there are several others fynonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, that appeared at the various parlours of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarked for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not part company therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the prisoner only attracted his attention, that he might by some chance quell it, and throw fear into those creatures whose thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead lady's eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one point seemed to penetrate throvgh the inner workings of the heart; but fell upon the chest with a loaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to vivacious excitement, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in his presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hangers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every class. Shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and had all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice: –but in consequence, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was forgotten, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was inferior to him: yet such was the appa rent cautlon with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of winning torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparenl hatred of vice, he was as often among the females who farm the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lorond a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great grandparents, the parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his needs, while having neglected the more important charge of his mind to the care of medical staffs, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many men's apprentices. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and bought that beauty was created by Providence meroly for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage chiefly consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variourous patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing and romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening appearances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into also doubts of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was convinced, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasuring pictres and descriptians contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, no compunction in feeling gratified greatly, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the possibility impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other figns of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the absence of their contact: allowing imagination to picture about every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he formed this object into the hero of a myth, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and made so far advance upon his career, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embezzled, and soon sound, from the notes of preparation in Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only betted his acquaintance, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to retire from the tour, which for many years has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stops in the care of vice towards putting themselves upon an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever sensational intrigues are mentoned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately making his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of affection from man, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of slagging Lord Ruthven's character, and now he believed, that, though many more of his associates were exposed to his view, the results affered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his generosity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his band more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, and to sink him still deeper in his lethargy, he was sent away with rich charms. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous class. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still indelibly impressed upon his mind: and those upon whom it was bestowed, inevably sound that there was no mercy upon them, for they were either led to disgrace, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the audaciousness with which his companion sought for the centres of all possible vice; there he entered into the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, from which he generally watched the society passing: it was not, however, when he encountered the rash youth of a novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; when his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fury; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to he even sufficient to satisfy their present needs. Yet he took no money from the counting table; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last giver he had just sriatched from the violent grasp of the innkeeper: this could not be the result of a certain lack of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of exceeding the curulating of experience. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to renounce that charty and pleasurable which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own purposes; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the many wild and rich scenes of nature, was much the same: his voice spoke less than his lip; and although Arthur was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater enjoyment from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey then arrived at Romance, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the mourning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost destroyed city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the other were from his friends, the more astorished ones; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seem to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his highly dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originclted from hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, thot his victim, the partner of his lust, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vaunted virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and depravity: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single blemish point which could rest her eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning them together, promising, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoliced. He entered into the same room, and there perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an adulterous femme is dealt with in society; be was therofore obliged to carry on his career in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all directions, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he answered the accusation of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired, and immediately writ-ten.\nHaving a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline attending his Lordship for the remainder of their pretended tour, he ordered his serjeant to search other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was deferred. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peloponnese, soon found himself at Athens. He took up his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon immersed himself in tracing the faded records of anciontry upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she had formed the model for a painter wishing to pour light on and carry the promised hope of the failed in M'Comet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have entertained her?\nHer eye, however, was apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suituated but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and sometimes would the uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letter he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such luminous and swiftly fading hues, it might well excite the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and glittering ballſ. Whilst he drew those reminiscences of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future children, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pictures she remembered having in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression up on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and valued ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she clung to him the names of old men who had at last discovered one living among them, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so insensible, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all lended to excite belief in the supernal power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ann, her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wormed his heart; and while he rid himself of the idea of a young man of English hails, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to her almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan of some aritiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was obtained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that soemed to be the right possessor of his thoughts. The woman was entirely unaware of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skewing or uncavering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed the existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through that wood, where no one would ever remain, after the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most hoavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey heard some of their representations, and tried to laugh it out of the room; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal weapon, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unaltered; he was surprised to observe the melancholy condition of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, macking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them to such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in circulation; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his search, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come, and that in the horizon there was one of those sphecks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was abovc–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick heavy rains forced their way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forks of lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to persuade someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to protect him from the pelting of the slorm. As he approached, the thunders, now almost silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rumbled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unresponsive; and, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: the enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling up on his breast, had placed his hands upon his heart when the glare of many lorches penetrating through the hole, which gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was followed by his longer beard. The storm was raging still, and Avrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the fire looded on every internal straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping to forget. It was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the life that dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the wound: to this the men painted, crying, simultaneously slunk with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A truce was quickly formed, and Aubrey was soon by the side of her who had longly been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the weight of life that had died within her. He knew not what these things were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into reflection, and take refuge in melancholy–he beld almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by dissolute parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable conduct, as they approached the city, forewarned the public of a dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being confined to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was sometimes delirious; at these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Henderson; by some unaccomplicable circumstance he seemed to beg of his former companions to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athenſ, and, from whatever means, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose appearance he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutledge, by his kind words, implying most repentance for the foult that had caused their separation, and greatly relieved by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astoriished Aubrey; but as soon as his deterioration began to be rapid, he almost immediately retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Dividing the last stage of the animal's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun; but he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's appearance, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once distinguished him now seemed to have fizzled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amid the ruins he had formerly frequenled, Anthea's form stood by his side; but if he searched it in, the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwoad, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a mirthful smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every one of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Glasgow neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached. Though they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard murmurs of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these rumours, which they imagined were only the invention of indignant spirits, whose object it was to exeite the generosity of the people whom they defended from such prelended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guards than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the head of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to regret their negligence; far from being the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bulets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthin and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but alarmed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the raiders should climb above and take them in the roar, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brough him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own conscience, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—hif guards having, on Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey induced him to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their pretences–they being content merely to guard the establishment till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an account. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, and he feemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the occurrences about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apporontly uneasy, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that. I mean not my life, I dread the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may be my hero, your friend, my honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. I know but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my name were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. –\"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, regaining himself with superhuman violence, \"Swear by all your soul revocable, by all you nature fearful, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or what you may see. His eyes seemed burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sprang laughing upon his knees, and broke no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do. When he remembered his oath, a cold shivering chill came over him, as if from the prospect of something terrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when the robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mountain, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it would be exposcd there. The first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, compelled to go and throw it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed to the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjunctions, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a career in which he had met with some terrible misfortunes, and in which all had apparently conspired to heighten the superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to corvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of violence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and clubs. Wilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further purchase, he found the weapon, and whose horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he hold in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to believe; but the peculiar form, the same varying tints upon the haft and shoath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his friends inquiries were made concerning the lady he had endeavoured to snalch from Lord Ruthven's soductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almast brokon under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of justice. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, carried him to the English seas; and he hasleried to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, apposed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room attendants. There was none of that light brotherliness which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the intelligence of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul peculiar of a darker realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her happiness, and would in her presence forget those grievances she knew destrayed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as though those eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, where he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a dancing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the splendour of royalty, hastened to attend. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was following in a trance himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this same place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on his spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his brains were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in disorderly array–the dagger–his oath–he roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he endeavoured to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining acquaintance. He went a few nights afterwards with his father to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his habit of devouring flesh. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revelled to him those features he so abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, dragged her towards the street. He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sifter, soon reached home. At the door he found himself pushed by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Rember yovr aath!\"\nAubrey became extinct. If before his mind had been occupied by one subject, how much more completely was it engaged now?\nCrossed, now the certainty of the monster's evil agajn pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to expain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildored. His oath bound him; was he then then to allow this monster to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He had thought of employing his own hand to free the world from this wretched wretch; but death, he remembered, had been altogether mocked. For days he remained in this state; but up in his window, he saw no one, and cried only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him in the evening to the house; but at last laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer more dangerous than any he had ever known. His conduct, however, sudderily ended. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom in his presence they were unconscious, he resolved to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his gait and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so disturbing, that his sister was at once obliged to beg him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought it advisable to interpose, and, fearing that his family was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufserings he had so often encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was consined to his cell. There he would often lapse for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recovery having displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, regarding her hands, with looks that severely afflict her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not hurt him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Once again he fell into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his illness became worse.\nHis eyes became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would courit upon his friends a definite number, and they would smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously who. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met before in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intent to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sifter. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again guilty of being affected by the influence of her love-smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so doting for her and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast, and opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a most intense expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his depression, entered, and forcing him to Miss Aubrey, desisted her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay him for one day. The police, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been reproved with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his expression and demeanor could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this infamy. He hastened to the house of his former coinpanian, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his state, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of him as of an indomitable having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell him, since he knew her, his address, had begun to seem strangely of prefervation, if it were merely that ho might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embossy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the prisoners, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, cursing her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the salvation of those now in the grave, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay for a few hours her marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed without rest to the inmates of the house; and Avrey heard, with a horror that may more easily he conceived than described, the sounds of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servitors on last occurrence, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, seething with rage. When on the stand, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and swear, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he directed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not leaving vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he described exactly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disclosed, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1881, we put into the harbour of Mityleno in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo and vegelcloes always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the trock for ship's bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Soho, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greck as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in this felvcca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Marylebone, where I was likely to be married. He was an add, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about £50 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not consistently; for he sails from his cottage very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in having been to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us towards the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bodroom, with a staircase close annexed. They were all densely decorated: plain grey-stajned walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leering posture; a large couch or sofa constituted the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an oak book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single window. The bed chamber had morely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two strewfed colton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Glasgow. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were now in a large seaman's chest in the corner: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet in the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Last, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English hooks of any description. Most of these books were filled with criminal notos, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe prisoner said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one book with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm far beyond the trouble of taking care of, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pinnacles and fret-work cornices, (as is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were almost wholly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stonc balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are fully furnished, as upon which the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachrymna christi,\" eating frujt, and enjoying the ovening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges, and other fruits were clustering together on its border, and under the shade of two large myrtle shoots, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told the lord passed many of his evenings and mornings till twelve o'clock, rooding, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppo se,\" replied the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vegetable gardens led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle tree in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestical decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the wood near the mountain's base. The sky is clear as glass, and an orbizon unshadowed by a single cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and maple-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a cigar more than I did here; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic soliloude: none knew his name but Domnick, his banker, who had garried to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could not, sir.\" I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fart?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt some considerable particulars of the affair. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving the lace articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testamen to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-bore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had done so it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentrics which he supported bore peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were difpelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been on travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mykene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Charles Harold\" being put in our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in the front page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our searches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite unintelligent, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the finer foibles of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their home in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his acts; and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Violence hath thrown her mask. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to my loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Repairs are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against a man's moral integrity; and he who dares defend himself before that extraordinary tribunal which he must appear, alone may cure the errors of a fellow-man. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. To do good in private, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.",
    "4": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Porter\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has evidently assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead ripping from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the disease existed, in which vampyres generally imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; while these human blood-suckers faltered, and their veins became distended to such a point of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 32, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a peculiar case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a valkyrie, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the valkyrie's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that several persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consented their removal, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the chest and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burried his body, and threw the remains into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in turn, become agents upon those who survived them.\nThe common belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThe monstrous description is scarcely qualified, but it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observation than any other evidence which could be adduced. In many parlours of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftr death, for some horrible crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not intrinsically doomed to vampyrise, but rather confined his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affectian.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut now on account, as Varnypre prophesied, the corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the present place, and suck the blood of all thy relatives; From your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the course of life; Yet now the banquet which perforee must feed thy living corse, Thy vicars, when they yet experience, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou curfusing them, Thy flowers are withered on the spot. But on that for thy crime must fall, beloved of all, God bless thee with a father's mercy! That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must do thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowd hand shall touch the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pleasure was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorandum of agony! Yel with your own best hair shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles in ave, Til these in horror shrink away from the spectre most accursed they are.\nMr. Southey has illustrated in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalcla,\" the vampyre nature of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But she cannot be supposed to have recovered from the sinsulness of her life, being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in great detail of some singular astonishing cases of vainpyrism, to which he prelends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his real reflection upon this subject, having collected a varioty of anecdotes, and technical narrations illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, lending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessorily devoted to explanation, and which may be concluded by merely remarking, that although the myth of the Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: the Vroucocha, Voulcoulcha, Goulcoy, Broucoche, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the rauciness around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laught of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those hearts whero thought fear renewed. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, gazing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the muse of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, throw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attroct his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceiving;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of her eyes, it was clear that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent conduct with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the refinement of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who habitually boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the posseion of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by his guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of medical authorities, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and caridour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as it was so in romances: he thought that the management of a cottage merely concerned the vesting of clothing, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the real facts of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which might describe with least truth their languishing or romping habits: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and their sparkling eyes, when he appeared upon them, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the regiment of his solltary hours, he was startled at finding, that except in the tallow and wax candles that slickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in real life or any of the congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his care.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his obscenity of external objects, was the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture any thing that flattered its position to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in his mind as the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the springs of his fancy, greater than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the manner of preparation in High Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he communicated to his friends, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable young people to take some rapid steps in the direction of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill they have in carrying them on. They consented, and Arnold afterwards mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flaltered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHORRIBLE.\nAubrey had no intention of flattering Lord Russell's character, and when he found, however, that many of his actions were expostulated to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not up to the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppresed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask some money, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importuriity of the vicissitudes, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the venerable indigent. There was one circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised to the apparent eagerness with which his companion went for the centres of a fashionable viee; there he entered into all the spirit of the farotable: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was all with the same unchanging character, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouraged the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fellow of a notorious family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent absolument of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sporkled with more fire than that of the devil whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lorn from the circle he adorned, living, in the fitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the grip of this fiend; whilst many a other youth became frantic, amidst the speaking calls of mute hungry children, with no means beyond that of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present needs. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; he immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, howevr, capable of exceeding the cunning of the man experienced. Avrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and surety which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking honestly and openly to him; but, thankfully, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he obtained no satisfaction from it beyond the congenial excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imaginings he had to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in good attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, when he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserced city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing no more than her usual affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had ever entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guards insisted upon his immediately leaving his fief, and urged, that his character was deliberately vicious, for that the practice of irreparable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his passion for the adultress had not originated from hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the female, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowesl abysmal depths of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all those females whom he had sought, apperently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforinity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest his eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purchasing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight transaction pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lord'ship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon concluded that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocenl, though thoughlless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, insuring him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were much as he supposed he would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retorted; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline assisting his Lordship in the reinstatement of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assizes was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely directed his servant to not give his full assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's intervention.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his train towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself near Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, accused of honouring the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many colms.\nHonoured licenced hon. Under the same circumstances, however, existed a being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvas.\nShe held the promiscuous hope of becoming Mahomet's bride, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any man to believe. She could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gait a poor type of her habits; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of accustomed nature, for that sleepy luxuriatory look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the voluminous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere binder, show the whole body of her form, floating as though she were upon the water, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, and exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excite the recollection of the antiquary, who dismissed from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which we all feel, but none appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by orawded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his wife during hours, she would stand by, and witness the magic effects of the pencil, in tracing the scenes of her former place; she would then describe to him the circling shadows up and down the open avenues; would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful passion, marriage pomp she rememhered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supematural tales of her nurse. Her appearance and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amassing his frierids, and dearest ties, forced every man, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existance for the ensuing marms, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her off as such idle and horrible fantasics; but she cited to him the names of several men who had at last detected one living among their ranks, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the tradition and appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that he could bear no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her appearance, and her intellect, which contrasted with all the offbeat virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself increasingly and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was explained; but be always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an object that seemed altogether the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infernal being he had first known. She always seerned to part from him with reluctance; but it was becavse she had no longer any one with whom she could communicate her favourite havnts, when first her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructible hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, will several present, affirmed their evidence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross the path. Aubrey made light of these representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNexus murdering Aubrey set fire to his apartment.\nHe was surprised to observe the melancholy face of the prisoner, and was concerned to find that his words, mooking the fear of those terrible creatures, had irispired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for he had last night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at once mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interlude of rest—its heaving rain forced its way through the canopying fields, whilst the great forks lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangling forest. The animal at last, through great fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the piles of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thuriders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, accompanied by one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which exploded over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the snake, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He came himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed almost human: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormous force aginst the ground:–his enemy threw him down, and, kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the wood that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the breaking of the branches, as he broke through wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch lusted on every individual straw with fine flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was lately left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more came upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair companion lying in a lifeless condition? He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his deranged imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men rushed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy dreams, now saturated with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–he was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take refuge in vacuums–he held almost uncannily in his hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engagled in the fear of someone whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dread catastrophe. –To describe their feelings would be impassible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; they had been broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Russell and upon Ianthe; by some improbable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubrey, induced him to pace himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the prisoner recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathotic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conviction began to be rapid, he again gradually reverted to the same state of mind, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inalicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the prisoner's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tattered waves raised by the prevailing breeze, or in marking the progress of two orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that extraordinaryity of spirit which had formerly so distressed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athenaeum; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, the's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, his light step would appear wandering among the undergrowth, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would appear, in his imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself close by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece which he had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many rumours, but they gradually began to doubt these reports, which they supposed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the genorosity of those whom they defended from perceived dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of their inhabitants, on one occasion they traited with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for suddenly were the whole of the police engaged in the narrow pass, where they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoing roport of several guns. In an instant the guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the prisoner came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the stilltering turn of the tide: but ashamed of being led astray by a foe, who with insultingly calls had them advance, and being exposed to unresisting violence, if any of the robbers should come above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contestor at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransome, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content in themselves. He would guard the entrance till their commander would return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who continued to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the declarative of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exuberant bravado, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my sickness or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or whomever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swam!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nHe retired to his bed, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with the man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as though from some premonition of something horrible awaiting him. Rising suddenly in the morning, he was about to enter the room in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the penitentiary of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it would be exposed to the first cold ray of themoon that rose after his death. Aubrey became distressed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the window he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to heighten that superftitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a servant to take him to Ortranta, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those things he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovigated in the farm hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same umbering tints upon the head and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their finances ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Avrey's mind become almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of faith. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in watching the speed of the post-mortem, as if he were trying to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he led to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine charms, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, he was still more attached to her as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There was a melancholy about it which did not seem to arise from fury, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a darker realm. Her step was not that of a footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened with the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget her griefs. She knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous woman? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eight years, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her present appearance should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, however, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast appraaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansions of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowored him. He could not feel interest in the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own freedom to the protecion of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been adapted as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was enormous–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Russell was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on that spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and placed his hands upon his head, of if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him: circumstances caused up a dreadful arroyo—the dagger—his oath. He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again! He thought his imagination had cornered up the imaginations his mind was passing upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few minutes after with his sister to the assembly of some relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a cellar, and there gave himself up to his own devourers.\nYour thoughts. Pereiving, at last, that many were living, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several persons, appareritly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revelled to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of seruants who were walking for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached her.\nAubrey became most distraoted. If before his mind had been absorbed on one subject, how much more completely was he engrossed, now that the certainty of the mother's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in consequence that she inreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He then uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him: was he to allow this monster to roam, bearing wrath upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the woman from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roclmed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress become neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the in-night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening meal to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to support him; but they wore themselves distanced by him who fled from a purfuer than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his own absences the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward fogs so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought it proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesired of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a phyſician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at once so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would remain for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of asfection and recovery remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometime start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only reply was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank to a slate, whence not even she could reach him. He lasted many months, but gradually, as the year was passing, his incoherencations became less frequent, and his mind seemed to brew off a pall of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the first day of the year, one of his servants entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared they had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her beautiful smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his well-wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; upon seeing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her former husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a forbidding expression of maintenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man again, for be– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him to sever his arms–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the governess and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a repetition of his disorder, entered, and forcing him to meet Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He sell upon his goods to them, he begged, be begged of them to lend him but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and relented.\nLard Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one present. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he fully understood him to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was decared insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this infatuation. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by cousin attendance, and the pretenience of great affection for the brook and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual baving no sympathy with another being on the crowded earth, save with the one to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had he gone to seem unworthy of service, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important commission, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubre, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, offending her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced her with the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without reply to the busy inmates of the house; and Arnold heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than desisted, the notes of busy preparation. Mourning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aurrey grew almost fainter. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with which he was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartmen, who were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediatoly approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Receipt your oath, and know, if not a bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" Saying, he pushed himself towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not letting vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was suspended, and the bride and groom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thorns of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCIDENT.\nOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetable's always to be had there, induce many Brits to visit it—thousands men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather short of the track for ships baund to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the hay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Etna (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to got married.\" He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred shillings for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in a felucca very frequently to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-roam, with a spousal closet attached. They were all densely decorated: plain green-stainod walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small founlain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnaces.\n-iture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an oak book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed through all Grecce. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open. We did not think our circumstances justified examining the circumstances. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspear's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's work, complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmern's Messiah, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kolzebue's Revolutions; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messina was continually scribbled all over, and marked with small pieces of paper, on which also were remorked.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a favour; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, excopt twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armerian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces wide and fourteen feet high, and the fluted marble pillars with round pinths and ret-walled cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey earpet, and an awning of strong coarfe linen. Most of the house-tops are furnished, as upon them the Greeks spend their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrysanthemum,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and other fruits were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden baek was placed, on which we were told, the defendant passed many of his evenings and nights till eleven o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our children twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an enormous Greek lemple appeared in majestic decoy. A small stream running from the ruins descended in broken casements, until it was found in the woods near the mound's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an azure horizon veiled by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty cedars and palm-trees, several streams can be distinctly observed, sludding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Damnick, his bariker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you toll, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not gone to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt some valuable particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who lived by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we communicated, to have a very eccentric and benevolent character. In this circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had one most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had borne her a piano-forte, and taught her the use of it.\nSuch was the inforination with which we departed from the peaceable isle of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in disguise could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiarius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in campany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had no choice. We had then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Cale in that very page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the hope of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as having an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is quite the reverse, as may be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firmer seelings of life, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's pooms, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and crescentity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of soliloude if an additional reward for markling him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his appearances, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, porticularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "5": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Amendment to the Act. Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a dead body could not remain if landed in their territory, it gradually contracted, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that men nightly imitated a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and frequently died of consumptions; whilst these man-boad-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended into such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Modreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the pace, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing bimsels with his blood. This conviction, however, did not prevent him from becoming violent himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, several persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further violence, the inhabitants having satisfied their fears, took up the dagger, and found it (as is supposed to be used in case of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nostrils, and ears, pure and florid. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the common remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adapled with the condition of those prisoners who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in the turn, be an agent upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person fucked with a vampyre becomes a murderer himself, and kills in his own turn.\nChief Justice.\nThis monstrous scene is here related, hecause it seems more adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition aluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vompyre sent, the corse shall from time to time be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy creatures; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet from the banquets which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, must know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers have withered on the stem. But now that for thy crime must fall, The God, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name. That word will wrap thy cart in flamo! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view, which freezes on her lifeless blue; Then will an unworthy hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when shorn from Armstrong's head was worn; But now is washed away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip;Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and will Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from a place more accursed than thy.\nMr. Southey has also included in his collection a short but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she having expressed herself about the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Comte, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of compilations, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffocate.\nEvidence for the limits of a rule, necessorily subjected to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking that though the term Vampyre is the one most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrau colocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, here appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the nation a nobleman, more remarked upon for his singularity, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the prisoner only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those ranks where his ignorance reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the officer's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one point seemed to pierce through to the inner workings of the heart; but falling upon the chest with a leaden ray that weighed up the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having him in their presence occupying their attention. In spite of the dejected hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, the fact that its farm and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempt to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercé, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:–but in vain:–when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–evidently her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But the common adultress could not influence him. From the appearance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent contempt with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed him to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was often as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who conceal it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey, who was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of her grandparents, by parents who died while he was yet a child. Left also to himself by guardians, who though it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his management to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his men. He had, however, that high ramantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily struck so many milliners' apprentices. He wished all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the ruffery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of elothes, which wore as warm, but which were more adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and voluminous coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of children were the realilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many men surrounded him, speaking which would prescribe with least truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon plunged him into false nolions of his talents and talents. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the prosence of a fire, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation whatsoever for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation for his gratisied vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary occurrence we have above described, coincided him in his career.\nHe had the very impossibilily of forming an identity on the character of a man entirely absented in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, except the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flatter its prapensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a myth, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He came acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Russell's affairs were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was unable to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perspire in the way, which for many generations has been thought necessary to induce the young to take some rapid steps in the direction of vice towards pulting themselves upon an equality with the agod, and not allowing them to act as if lords of the skies, when over sundry intrigues they are mentioned as subjects of pleasure or of praise, according to the degree of skill required in corrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediate after mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to marry him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from a man, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circumnavigating waters.\nHitberto Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed in his view, the results elicited different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the boggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not from the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon his virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosecutor came to ask for money, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous gent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was far more impresstance upon his mind: all those upon whom he was stowed, inevitably found that here was a curse upon them, and they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avrey was surprised at the apparent ease with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the sprits of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his adversary, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unhinging face, with which he generally watched the society entertainments: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless sather of a numerous family; then his very wife seemed fortune's law—this apparent bankruptedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more interest than that of the cot whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In a manner of his own, he left the former affluent youth, and from the circle he adorned, immersed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of the violence; whil many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, with but a single farthing of his late immense wealth, which could not buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of money, the last giver he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: they might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of competing with the crowing of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reply to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own interests.\nHe intended it; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and honestly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his courtship, and amidst the various wild and rich scenaries of life, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and when Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater satisfaction from it than the constant excitement of vainly striving to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something peculiar.\nThey soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which appeared with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardian; the latter astonished him; if it had before enterciated into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicarious, for they thought the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, render his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all the other females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not conspired to expose the deformity of their bodies to the public gazette.\nAubrey determined upon leaving the country, whose fortunes had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no flight circumstancnces pass by unnoticed. He entored into the matter, and soon perceived that the Lord Mayor was endeavouring to wake up from the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whom he so frequently frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and he discurred that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though bought-up girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly expressed his intentions with respect to the lady, insuring him at the same time that he was earnest of his intention to meet her very soon. Lord Ruthven answered, that her intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed what he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must do without accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other offices, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of what he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Rutledge next day merely expressed his fervant to nolify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubroy directed his sights towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded traces of human glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of commemorating the deeds of freemen only against slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or monochrome coloured rocks. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pair of spinners wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of the falthful Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced up and down the path, or tripped along the precipice's side, one would have bought the gazelle a poor type of her clothes; for whom would have exchanged her eye?\nApparently the eye of impressed nature, for that sleepy luxuriated look of the animal suited not to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl accompanied Avrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were on the wind, to the eager gazes of him, who often forgot the names he had just decyphered upon an almighty tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Never would her tresses folling, curls which flitted around, exhibit in the sun's rays such delicately brilliancy and swish.\nIn this fading hue, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the author, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of great importance to the proper interpretative of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magical effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the operatic stage, would point, to him in all the glowing colour of youth and memory, the marriage pomp she remembered watching during her insancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talismans of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest of Aubrey; and as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had spent years amidst his friends, and dearestties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to keep her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; and she cited to him the names of old men, who, at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so insensible, she begged of him to help her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the tradicular appearance of these men, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lothrd Ruthven; he, however, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculated the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself becoming more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, having a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was completed; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed entirely the sole possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantilo being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncavering some fragility which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the sufficiency of Vampyros, and they both, with several present, affirmed their innocence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when the company heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his ring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mooking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to deport, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put into action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his researches, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horzon there was one of those specks which, in the warm climates, rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted congregation. He at once, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twight, in the southern climates, is the most unknowable; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and although he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its booming thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the cariopulating foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadfulrapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through great grief, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead loaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting someone to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to heart the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a man, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for although he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baffod!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed almost human: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his adversary threw himself upon him, and kneeing upon his breast, had placed his hands up to his throat when the glare of many torches perching through the hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the doorway, and in a moment the cutting of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those near. They entered; the light of the torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Avrey he searched for the woman who had attracted him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of her fair conductions brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour on her eye, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to his the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was created, and Aubrey was placed by the side of her, who had lately been the object of some very bright and fairy visages, now fallen with the weight of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost uneasily in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the court, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable circumstance he feemed to beg on his form of coinion to spare the being be killed. At other times he would inflict maledictions upon his head, and curse him for her desecration. 3rd Rutledge, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Avrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter re recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and appalled at the image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attentions, anxiety, and concern which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present position. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic creature who had so astonishcd Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually reverted into the same state of mind, and Aubrey percieved him.\nHe received no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of ralicious exultation playing on his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appareritly engaged in watching the tides and waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of the sun's rays, circling, like our world, the moueless sun;—indeed, he appeared to be to avid the eye of all.\nAurey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, he could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it near the inn he had formerly frequented, Antoinette's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round. He would see, to his wild imaginings, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly soerieſ, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hasteried from place to place, yet they decided not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbery, but they gradually began to doubt these reports, wbich they imagined were only the imaginings of iridividuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their beads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves upon rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Routhven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment into the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bore them in advance, and being exposed to ongoing slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and attack them in the rear, they desisted at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rulhven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contretemps or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–the guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promise of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded prisoner to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was once more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decayed; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed approaching with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as much in a state of pain as he had been of the offences abou him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind become apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! Assist me!\" You may sue me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the dictates of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may sue my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me what? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I can not explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. –\"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Sow by all your soul resues, by your professional fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" Aubrey; he sunk lying upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man remained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which ho had left the body, when a robber met him, and informed him that there was no corpse there, having been conveyed by him and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubry astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed to the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his search was fruitless without success, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing six children.\nThe articles of offence, more or less adapted to occasion the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious sheaths, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hatching to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had entrusted to learn from Lord Ruthven's seductress arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became overwhelmed under so many repelled horrors; he was afraid that this day had fallen a victor to the destrayer of the nation. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infrequent caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was becoming more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the beatified atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her left eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from melancholy, but from some feeling within, which appeored to indicate a soul conscious of a greater realm. Her foot was not that light foot, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never broken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed upon her his affection, and would in her present forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own notive spectacles. She was only eighteen, and had not yet been presented to the world, having been thought by her friends more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the Continent.\nWhen he came, he would be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansions of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which overcame him. He could not feel intimate with the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a dressing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hasteed thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a cornyard by himself, heedless of all around him, engoged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his fury on this spotupon his first entry into society. He gazed till his eyes almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a frier, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he heaved himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Byron again before him–circumstances stacked up in dreadful array–the dagger–his throat–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to learn concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, al last, that they were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in carnal condition; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and reverently to him their features he was horrified. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he suddenly heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, having succeeded in robbing his sister, soon recovered himself.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon him? His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this morister to ruin up his breath, amidst all he had done, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been poisoned by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but then, he remembered, he had already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At midnight, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which haunted him. His dress was well-defined, and he wondered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overcame him. His sister, anxious for his safety, induced people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuerswifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggling with the fact that he left by his own free will the company of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfconscious, he determined to enter again in society, and watch him closely, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, through her sister, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought it proper to interpose, and, finding that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirée of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicant to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at once so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, in fear of being roufed. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks which evidently afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not louch bim—if your love for me is aught, doth not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that severa times in the day he would count upon his friends a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his servants entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Auhrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's acquaintance was attested; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astounded them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more adue to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his customary warmth, and to offer congratulations upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long insuited his life. He seized the portrait in a fit of rage, and trampled it on his foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the possibility of her future happiness, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not agree–it seemed as if that voice had bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Routhven was near him but found no one. In the meantime the guardians and physiclan, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relight of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, and begged of them to delay but for one minute. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthen had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Ayre's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; and when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretences of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tolls to count–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servant, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their lives, to delay but for a few days that marriage, on which he reserved the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the maid of Miss Aubrey by, as he considered, the ravages of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ears. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless woman. He seized the opportunity, when one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthvon was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remain your oath, and swear, if not my oath to day, your sister if dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his fellows, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. He couldn't longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to her sister, who was present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom loft London.\nAvrey's weakness increased; the effusion ceased.\nA sudden loss of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight bell had struck, be related compositionally what the reader has printed immediately after.\nThe guardians hastoned to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Avrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT FOR LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LDR. BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, who had to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, onboard one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of catchers and vegetableſ always to be had there, induce many Brilish men to visit it—both men of war and merchontmen; and since it lies rather out of the way for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for oats with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schoal, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who had left the island four days previous to our arrival in his feucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, overlooking the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six shillings for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he fails in his journey very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our counsellor resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who advised us over the course. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a silting parlour, and a bed room, with a small closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walnuts, marble tumblers on either side, a large window in the centre, and a mantle all fountains beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed ootton quilts and a pillow–the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we found a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then joined with a large scaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaire's, Speare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works compendium; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robberf; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torrid, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to pace them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a vice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except two zechines which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the five monumental marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greek arcitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a heavy Turkey carpet, and awning of strong coarse linens. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon which the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side, as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, orchids, and limes clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which, we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcis, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the mine descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in favour; and alittle on the left, through avista of lost chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Domnick, the banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenlan, but on our return to the town we learned some personal particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fishorman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, be apparted to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentrically and benevolently character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper to disclose. He had a young beautified daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself to make use of it.\nSuch was the information when we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiarity. Arrived at Palermo, all objections were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at M'Ilene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into circulation we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our refearches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to what day will we return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his Majesty's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with man nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gleaned from the foregoing anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his house. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is on addition a reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolentee hat thrown her mantle. No man can read his preceding pleasing \"traits\" with any feeling of being proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that august tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his nickname. To do good in secret, and receive the world's applause, is the surest mark of a virtuous heart and self-controlled conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "6": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this talismans is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually engulfed, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it occurred, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the disease existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a stale extent, as to cause the blood to flow from all the points of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, on account of credible evidence, a paralular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrate of the place, they positively and unequivocally affirmed, that, about five years before, an officer, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been threatened by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by climbing some of the oak out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, didn't prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischievousness, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid odour. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reprieved to have cried out as dreadfully as if he were still alive. This done, they cut of his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had deliberately died from vampyrism, lest they might, in their turn, come down upon others who survived them.\nThe common belief is, that a person sucked by a monster becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tummy.\nChrétien bailiff.\nThe monstrous affair is well related, but seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present servations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to make his infernal visculations only to those beings be loved first while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition contained in the \"Gael.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corse shall froin its tomb be rent; The ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy creatures; There from by daughter, sister, wife, and midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers have withered on the stalk. But one that for this crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, who bore thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap your heart in flame! Yet thou must on thy last day mark Her cheek's last tear, her eye's last spark, and the last glancing glance must view which freezes her life in a lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall touch the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, once, in life a lock upon which her American's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of the Day! Yet with your own best blood shall you drink; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with cheers and applause, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also produced in his wild but charming poem of \"Thalaba,\" the unfortunate character of the Arabian maid Neiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her character, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The correspondent Tournefort gives a long accourit in his description of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon his subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditonal narratives illustrative of various sects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting reflections on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be included by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, here are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, he appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth about him, as if he could not participate therein. Appareritly, the laughter of the fair on Sunday appealed his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain why it arose: some attributed it to the dark grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to pulse, and at one glance to peree through to the inward workings of the body; but fell on the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions.\nLady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms during her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did not put on the dress of a barman, to attract his notice; but in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unseeing; and thus her unappeasable impudence was borne, and the affair was ended. But since the commotions could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was unfavourable to him: yet so was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to her. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that he even aroused the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his opprobrious hatred of vice, he was often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their distinctive virtues, as opposed those who sully it by their vice.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who though it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relieved the more important charge of leaving him to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more of his imagination than his judgment. He had, he said, that higantic fecling of honour and candour, which daily ruins many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestiges of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many others surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their long-suffishing or romping favouritos: the daughters at the fame time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false riotions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except for the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of light, there was no room in real life for any of that compendium of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in three volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation from his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary occurrence we have above described, occurred him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the witness imparted information.\nThe value of having an idea of the consequences.\nThe character of a man entirely abused in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, informed him of the avoidance of them altogether: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flaunted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the springs of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him compliments, and so far advanced upon his career, that his presence was always recognised. He subsequently learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were bankrupt, and found, from the notes of preparation in Stretton, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had ony whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his friends, that it was time for him to perform the duty, which for many generations had been thought necessary to enable the young to take a rapid advance in the career of vice, by placing themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if distant from the fold, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, accarding to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately declaring his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his associates were exposed to his view, the results of a subsequent commission contradicted the apparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his liberallty; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate troubles. Mr. Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he stowed his articles; these were removed from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosecutor came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater portability of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous. There was one circumstantial about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more pressing upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably felt that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion saught for the pleasures of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same urbane face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he ennobled the rash youth of a particular neighbourhood, or the luckless fatality of a numerous families; then it very much seemed fortune's law—this abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cot whilst dallying wit the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the habits he adorned, cursing, in the throes of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the roach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of their late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient food to feed their preferent children. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the very gold he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combatting the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasvre which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he dared not do it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven, in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was much the same: his eye poked less than his lip; and though Aubry was near the object of much curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of those wishing to break that mystery, which to his exhausted imagination began to assuage the appearance of something unnatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he soon found him in daily attendance upon the marriage commission of an Italian countess, which he went in fear of the memorials of another infamous city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had hefore entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his comportment, the circumstances seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians urged upon him immovably leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicarious, for that the possession of revolting powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his passion for the adultross had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his reputation, that the victim, the partner of his career, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowes abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expase the whole extent of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey descended upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bruise on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon received, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore able to carry on his plans in secret; but Avrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rulhven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to marry her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would bear upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately sending a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lord President. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely asked his servant to secure his completeness to effect a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps through Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicle the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or monochrome lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and deceased, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint upon canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to someone who had no salvation. As she dancod upon the plait, or tripped upon the mountain's side, one would have seen the gaze of a poor type of her friend; for whom would have observed her eye, opparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light breeze of the day accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her trosses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray delicately brilliant and fiftily fading hues, which might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balms. Whilst he drew the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and witness the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours of her youthful memory, the marriage window she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to matters that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her story, and apparent belies of what she narrated, entertained the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amid his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a young female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old friends, who, having at once detected one living among them, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the slamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question its existence, always had some proof giving, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the tradional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a precise description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Routhven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her innocence, so determined was he that all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of romance, won him heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian rescarch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an object that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was incapable of love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructivo band of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very idea. Soon afterwards, Aubrey determined to proceed on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for. Sometime in the future. When they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessorily pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had passed, upon any consideration. He described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denied the vile evils of them upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reprobation, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder all his hair thus to mock a superior, immortal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood free, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unassisted; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of these terrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so excited in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon arrive, and that in the horizon the sun was one of those specks which, in the warmer climatic conditions, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted crowd. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in these southern climatics, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had soared above an interminable hour of rest—its thick heavy rain forded its way through the canapying foliage, whilst the great forked ligaments seemed to fall and radiate at his very feel. Suddenly the prisoner took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the enclosed forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he saw, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrioks of a woman mingling with the fifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continuod in an almost urbane sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; and, though he called, still nothing transpired, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately alarmed; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with tremendous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his back, had placed his hands up to his throat; but the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the arms of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless state. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a vision rising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, slretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed most as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously slunk with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many joyful and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun recollection, or take refuge in vacancy–he had almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of some particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of someone whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the court, forewarned the parents of some dread cataclysm. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they reached the corner of their chamber's room, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corner. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a first violent fever, and was often delirious; in the latter intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthvon and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his master company to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecisely place maledictions upon his head, and wese him her deserter. Lord Routhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and staggered at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the affection, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship had quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his condition began to be ropid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless surface;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so dispelled him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of seclusion and silence as Lord Mayor; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought it amidst the rivins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; her suddenly turning round, would flash, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every one of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbery, but they gradually began to hear slight reports, which they imagined were largely the work of individuis, whose object it was to expunge the generality of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled only a few guords, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely half the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several shots. In an instant their guards had reached them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction wherice the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with his threatening shouts had them afraid, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb up and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces upon him–his comrades having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabaret; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more compelled by their promise–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days considerable intractability ensued, and death seemed inevitable with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had eighteen of the objects about him: but towards the close of last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, my father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot exploit the world–but if you would communicate all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown far some time from England–I—I–but not now.\" \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your foul reveres, by all their nature fears, that, for a year and a day you will not part your knowledge of my crimes or death to anyone living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his illness.\nInance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivoring came over him, from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey appalled, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a life in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to beighten that superstitious molancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Routh. Amongst other things there was a case containing feveral symptoms of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Upon turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the daggers discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he took the weapons, and his horror could scarcely be contained when he discovered that they fitted, quite peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainly—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to believe; but the particulate form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were extraordinary in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concernig the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their livelihood ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became a little broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the deceased of Harithe. He became morose and silent; and his melancholy occupation caused in speeding the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he hold dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her inferential caresses, had gained his affection, now that the women began to appear, she was still more attendant.\n-aching as a company.\nMiss Aubrey had that winning grace which went with the gaze and a pause of the drawing-room audience. There was a kind of light brilliancy which could only exist in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was constantly lit up by the intelligence of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that lazy footing, which strays where a butlerfly or a colossus may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When she was alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his last breath, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been exposed to the world, it having been bought by her guardians morefit that her present confinement should be delayed until her brother's return from the service, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next dancing-road, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remanded in the custody of his friends, and dwell upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolities of fashionable strongers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was extraordinary–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened to attend. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engorged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arms, and a voice, which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectacle that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He struggled till his limbs almost refusing to bear the weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven standing before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He rushed himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had made up the image his mind was dwelling upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthveri, the name hung up from his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few days ago with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a ruffian, he retired into a room, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he endeavoured to pass and get near her, when one, whom he compelled to move, turned round, and revealed to him the features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forced her down the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice which came to him—\"Remmber your oath!\"–He did not dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became extremely distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unhealed, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he supposed to allow this monstrosity to come to pass, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, what would be expected of him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a shame; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he drank no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing seclusion and solitude, he left his house, and from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he struggled, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at once he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dismissed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he had left by his own free will the lives of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he resolved to enter again into custody, and watch him closely, anxiously, and forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a career which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, but completely lost his mind abscorbed by one terrible suction. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had come emaciated, his eyes had attached a glassy-ness; the only sign of articulation and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the face of his sister; then he would sometimes shout, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! –if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his appearances became less frequent, and his mind seemed to take off a portion of the gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the holy necessity of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Shortly afterwards Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. On this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was evidently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once again alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished in rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monstrosity who had so long occupied his life. He seized the portroit in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the possibility of her future happiness, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frontic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him reinstate his oath–he turned sudderily round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the mean time the guardians and physician, who had heard the wholo, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and for keeping him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with cry one earl. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily offered himself to be in charge of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insensible, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wha could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of him self as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if only merely that he might listen to her soothing voice;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he had gained her affections. The little of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAurey, when he was left by the physician and his friends, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the salvation of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, in which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Auhrey by, what he considered, the rovings of a maniac. Night passed on without respite to the busy inmates of the house; and Anne board, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, heard the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, and they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly asembled. Lord Routhven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, she pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to hospital. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the opproach of death. He desired his father's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of Messy's vessel, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it must be out of the trock for some weeks bovnd to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyago. We met, as usual, at the bottom of the hill, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself look a long way to the cave containing Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met wit and engaged a young German gentleman as guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred guineas for it, (about £250 Eriglish Curroncy,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his seacoast very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an officer man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of three apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large laurel in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furnishing. In the hall stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no inirrors, except a single painting. The bedchamber had mercifully a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed across Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the officer told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large scaman's case in the closet: it was operable, but we did not feel our selves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recorder lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German Imagination; Klopstook's Moses; Kolzebue's novels; Scribe's play of the Robber; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and desired to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very gaod.\" I once did him a service; and I have all the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the landlord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pinnacles and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecturo,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of very coarse linen. Most of the houses on the terraces are well furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"clercyma christi,\" eating fruit, and joying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, orchids and lilies clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bowers, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eyeview.\" A line of rue vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream running from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodlands near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadawed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wove with spols of emerald greenery. I found myself enjoying a different experience than I did before; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his brother, who had gone to China. \"The American,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can't you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenics, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated place. He had portioned several young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, sheep to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by gathering these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-bore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infernation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our minds all on the rack, guessing who this ramblin' from Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiarity. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trunks on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chichester Harold\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcocks in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the castle, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie on some future day; but to me that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not wholly uninteresting, and doing justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unpleasant disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reversc, as may be palpably gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, firmness, and honesty appoar to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason far reaching for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevalence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. In respect to his pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Reports are over to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that infamous tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in society, and shun the world's applause, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving intellect.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crowcroft, Fleet-street.",
    "7": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidor.\nTHE belief upon which this tole is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form for the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondersul stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and descending upon the ranks of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyros nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily succumbed to their consumptions; which, the human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended in such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which if stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. He explained, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, ho had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyro's grave, and rubbing himself with it. This circumstance, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tortured by him, and deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted the Mr. Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praying having been obtained, they resumed their accustomed remedy. A blow was driven entirely through the hearse and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were employed with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who suffered from it.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked into a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his blood.\nCrown bailiff.\nThis monstrous libel is here repeated, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other evidence which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous offence committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but condemned to confine his infernal visitations only to those whom he loved most upon this earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection—as opposed to in the \"Gospels.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corpse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which by force must seed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know the meaning of death. Their sire: As cursing thee, thou cursing them, thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for a crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap you in flames! Yet they must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifetimes blue; The with unhewed hand shall tear the tresses of her hair from her head, of which, like life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Memorial of the enemy! Yet with your own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, G – and with Goulſ and Afrits rave, Till these screams of horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corso of the Arabian woman Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tovar gives a long account in his travels of several notorious cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of articles, and tradtional narratives illvstrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a scientific, as well as a barbarian error.\nMany curious and intemperate remarks on this singularly horrible occurrence might be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of note, sufficient for a sufficient explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyro is the one in most general acceptation, there are severa others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipatioris attendant upon a London winter, here appeared at the pleasure parties of the leader of the regiment an officer, more remarkable for his singular titles, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in it. Appropriately, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain why it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house that wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagling their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never had a warmer tint, other than from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and lines were beautifull, many of the female huriters of notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every minister shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet so was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his needs, when they entrusted the most important charge of his care to mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highly romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtuosity, and thought that vice was thrown in by circumstance merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by the irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and ruffian: for these reasons, upon his coming into the gay circle, many mothers surrounded him, and which should describe his first truthing of his languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the earliest time, by their brightening countenances when he appraached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of his solitory hours, he was startled at finding, that, except for the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a gas, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation or real life for any of the collections of poetry and scripts contained in those volumes, from which he had separated his study. Finding, howe-\nBut, compensating in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave more signs of his observation of extraordinary objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, induced by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon moulded this object into the hero of a romance, and resolved to obey the offspring of his passion, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so greatly advanced upon his reputation, that his position was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and he found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's-street, that he was absconding from the Treasury. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever certain intrigues are menioned on the subject of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them out. They consented, and Aubrey afterwards mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, be gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Ayre had had the opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though any part of his action were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from his apparent motives. His conduct was profuse in his liberality; the inmates, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not up to the voracious, reduced to indigence by the hardships attendant even upon virtue, that he gave his alms; they were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate come to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was given away without charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunty of the vicious, which generally provails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one observation about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubry was surprised at the apparent eagcrness with which his companion sought the centres of a fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he struggled, and always succeeded with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then struggled even more than he led; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he constantly watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a large family; when his very wish seemed fortune's will—this apparition absolved him of mind was laid aside, and his eyes closed.\nHe struck with more fire than the weight of the cat whilst dallying with the half-deceased in house. In every town, he left the formerly affluent families, torn from the circle he adorned, and found, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had drawn him with the reacb of his fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking look of mute hungry children, without a single recollection of his late indiscretions, wherewith to be even more efficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the loss of marbles, the last gilder he had not snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of kriewledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. He often wished to convey this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleaure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but ever, this never occurred. Lord Rutledge in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyes spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater pleasure from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which to his exalted imagination seemed to assume the appearance of some mysterious supernalural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily company upon the morriing court of an Italian governess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his friends, the latter astonished him; if it had before penetrated into his imagination that there was an extraordinary power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully dangerous, for that the possessively irresistible powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had requited, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the principal of his guilt, should behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask of innocence, and had not scrupled to expase the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a change, a point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, promising, in the mean time, to watch him closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was before obliged to carry on his business in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all manner, and soon concluded that an appointment had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartement of Lord Ruthven, and boldly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed he would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Rutledge next day merely sent his servant to ascertain whether complete obedience to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself with tracing the faded recards of ancient glory upon monuments that appeared, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only upon their slaves, had hidden them beneath the sheltering shoulders of many coloured men. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, too beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she darted upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gaze of a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an artiste, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the last tastes of an epicure. The light-headed girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kolkata butterfly, show the whole beauty of her body, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just written to her on an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like form. Often would her hair, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the question which he had before him of vitol importance to the proper investigation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wish to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would pass by, and witness the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would point, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her past. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amids his friends, and dearest ties, fattened every year, by foeding upon the life of a young female to prolong its existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's caprice; and when she heard him so incredulous, she begged of him to help her, for it had been marked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some provocation given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to do what was necessary. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the strange occurrences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutherven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Anthea; her loyality, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had saught for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the most beautiful form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-varian reexamination, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it difficult to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his goods. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same infantile being he had first known. She always feemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her husband was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several repented, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his objectives, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return al night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remount, after the day had elapsed, upon any consideration. He described it as the resort of the vampyres in their raucous orgies, and denounced the most terrible evils as impending upon those who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his dressing thus to mock a superlative, irifernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aury set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horribles, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night had allowed the power of the beasts to be put in action; he refused. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at once, howevr, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, darkness begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—it's echoing thunders had disturbed his hour of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the enclosed passage. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardy lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continved in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was app-\nApparently unperceived; for, though he struggled, still the robberies continued, and no one heard of him. He found himself in contact with some one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself being grappled by one who's strength seemed considerable: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain. He was lifted off his feet and hurled with considerable force upon the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeing upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of several torches penetrating the hole that gave light to the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They hurried; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the smoke loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the defilement of Aubrey they searched for her who had escaped by her cries; he was again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his faltering conductress brought him to a halt. He shut his eyes, hoping to forget. It was merely a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed his eyes, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as abstract as the life that one dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey stood by the side of her who had lately borne to him the object of so many bright and happy memories, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost curiously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their loudable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the porents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they had ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconstable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fury, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg his former companion to spare the being he loved. In other instances he would make pre-maledictions upon her head, and curse her as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, indicating a most repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, affection, and care which he showed, soon recovered him from his presence. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aury; but as soon as his convalescence began to bear fruit, he again degenerated into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to find his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of maliciæ exultant playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. DURING the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was scarcely engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the ongoing storm, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our own, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eye of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for freedom, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he should find it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Clerkenwell's form stood by his side—where he sought it. In the woods, her light step would appear wandering about the underwood, in quest of the most violet; and, suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a rueful smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit some part of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and visited every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but when they reached a place they hastened for a place to rest, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the jest of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, to serve as guides and as a defence. Upending, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of artillery guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to run in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the ditch: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being expased to unresistible servitude, should any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in pursuit of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rail, when Lord Ruthven recolved a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the command or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entranced till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an account. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the operations about him: but towards the close of the last hour, his appearance became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my husband, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I did very little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all knowledge of me, if my honour were free from stain in the world's mills–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" –\"Swear!\" \"Swear,\" said the dying man, revoking himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reverers, by your very fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impal your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed hursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Avrey; he fell laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to bed, but did not sleep; the circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose on his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the present knowledge of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the chamber in which he had found the corpse, when a robbber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, up before his retiring, to the house of a noighbouring mourner, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking hold of the knife, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was wildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clotts.\nWeary of a county in which he had met with some terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten the superstitious melancholy that had seeped upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing a special weapon of offence, more or less adapted to insure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and a hammer. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discouered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed going to be bound to the dagger; yet still be wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthveri's custody. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's heart became almost broken under so many repeated harrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer Hothfield. Witness. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she befused, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affections, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching him to a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not appear to arise from misfortune, but from some fceling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not on a light footing, wither stray hairs or a colour may attract—it was sedate and perisive. When alone, her face was never broken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians perfectly fit that her pretences should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, wher he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her career into the \"busy scena.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melaricholy which overpawered him. He could not feel interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his heart had been torn by the horrors he had witnessed; but he determined to secure his own comfort and the protections of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessing–a grand-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were onxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened thither. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engclosed in the recollection that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly begun to walk, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed down, his knees first refusing to bear his weight, he was obliged to hold the arm of a furlund, and forcing himself through the crowd, he found himself in his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–is oath–He roused him.\nBy himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near congregation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a room, and there gave himself up to his own desponding thoughts. Predicting, at last, that many were leaving, he retired himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd as servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, so reached home.\nAubrey was almost distracted. If hitherto his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complacent was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the prisoner's living again presfed upon his thoughts. Hissister's attentions were wholly unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified him. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow the morister to march, bearing menace upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of emplacing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that imagination which haunted him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no gentleman. He recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dispersed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any could run from him. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a daughter amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his demeanor and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a career which afsected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought it necessary to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resumé again that rule which had been imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily experienced during his wanderings, and preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they consider folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible suprise. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would remain for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had assumed a glassy lustre; the only sign of affliction and reversion remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is clogged, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a foetal, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that at certain hours in the day he would collapse upon his bed.\nGive a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, endeavoured to converse with his physician upon the melancholy occurrence of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Avrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they considered he had been degraded, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking he was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovoly sentiments; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being more responsive to her feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his well-willed warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a conduct so distinguishable for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the woman who had so long insuited his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for be– But he could not advise–it seemed as if someone's voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned sudden round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the same time the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and though this was but a return of his depression, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they believed had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and returned.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had refused with every one elses. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily undressed himself. He could not be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could scarcely be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pawer? His tongue had scars and toils to recount–could speak of him with the scorn of an indignant human having no sympathy with anyone on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it weremerely that he might listen to her saothing accents;–but fine, he knew better. Well, how to usethe serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The little of the elder house falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the world, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the affair with heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed without rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morrising came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overeame their interest, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was unable to prevent him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by surprise, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my word to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near occurrence of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relaled evidently what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Avrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sifter had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put in at the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of the place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for shippers bound to Smyrna, the bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the officials, the clergyman and myself took a ramble through a place called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain montaine).\nFrom there we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilferer,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Munich, where I am likely to get married.\" He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, overlooking the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for 1l., (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not always; he sails in his felucca very often to the different lands.\"\nThis account aroused our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were warmly received by an old man, who showed us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-slainched walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountains beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a large bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an enormous book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had merely a large matress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Glasgow. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paper, which were then in a large seaman's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Bakspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau's works, in French complele; Vanney's Roman Empires; Ziminerman, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebue's novel; Schiller's Protocol of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian compilations, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally searched all over, and met with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is generally very gaod.\" I once did him a service; and I have the property of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the regiment broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was displeasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Glasgow architeclure,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in music, drinking light wines, such as \"Lachryma cristi,\" eating sruit, and enjoying the evening hue.\nOn the left band as we entered the house, a fountain steamamlet glided awoy, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the defendant passed many of his Sundays and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, watching, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very dejected, \"and always attended our chapel twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oak and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A strong stream issuing from the ruins flowed in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an azure horizon unshadowed by a fingle cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, amidst a vifto of lofty chesnut and palin-trees, several small isles wore distinctly obstructed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this melancholy solitude: none knew his name but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not intended to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the towri we found several parlulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them during the feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by woaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the parish children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we cannot forget, which our old friend at the court bought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a plano-forte, and taught her to the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this man in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archbishop, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as having an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in anyway to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is quite the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feeling of the human race, so elogantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken a seat in his bosom. Tendorness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repase of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding describing \"traits\" without feeling certain of him as a notorious man. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed upon man's moral integrity; and he who dares defend him himself before that great tribunal, where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-morality. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in society, and shun the world's appeasement, is the furest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGeorge Gillett, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "8": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE circumstance under which this tale is told is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondersul stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austrla, and Lorraine, where the habit existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became starved, lost their strength, and speedily died of oansumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fainted, and their veins became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the pores of their skins.\nThe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that several persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further outrage, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) completely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entire through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as loudly as if he had been killed. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his victims.\nThe bailiff.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those friends he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by bonds of kindred affection. A proposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut now, on account, as Vampyre sent, the corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; You loathe the hanquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy vices, and your enemies. They yet expirc, shall know the demon for their sire; as cursing thee, I am cursing thee; thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The mother, best beloved of all, will bless thee with a father's love. The word will wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tear—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest protection was worn; But now is thrown away by thee Memorial of terrible agony! Yel with your own hands, and blood shall drip; by gnashing teeth, and hollers.\nThen stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Aunts follow, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accurate than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful paean of \"Tbalaba,\" the viceroy of the Arabian kingdom of Orieza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She was most loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful character of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Turner gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned deductions, tending to prove it to be accidental, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting natiques on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the weight of a note, wholly devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in general acceptation, here are feveral others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolacha, Vardoulacha, Gouda, Brovcoa, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a long winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing on the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance seemed to pierce through the inward workings of the heart; others gazed upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarity caused him to be invited into every house; children wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never seemed to take a warmer tint, whether from the blufh of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautifull, many of the female hunters after him attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every monster she saw in drawing-rooms since her marriage, lost herself in this way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apprentrently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; ever her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But though the common adultress could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning character; and whether it was that it even overcame the drod of his singular character, or that they were moved by his opparent hatred of vice, he was as ostentatious among those females who make the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Avrey: he was an orphan left with his only sister in the possession of her parents, who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the employ of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He begged all to sympathise with him, and thought that vice was indulged in by pleasure merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the mystery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothing, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fino, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sporkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into fanciful notions of his talents and his merit. Appealed as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundance in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was able to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an opinion of the character of this man entirely absorbed him, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avaidance of their conduct: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to entertain fanciful ideas, he soon moulded this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to obtain the offspring of his fancy, rather than the perversions before him. He came acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon him, that his position was commonly recognised. He subsequently learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarassed, and so found, from the riotes of preparation in Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desired of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had evidently whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guards, that it was time for him to postpone the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps away from the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appeor attack if fallen from the saddle, whenever corruptions are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubroy immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circulations.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were analogous to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent objections to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Ayre could not avoid remarking, that his gaze was not upon the virtuous, reduced to iridity by the misfortunes attending even upon family, when he bestowed his alms; these were sent through the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunily of the vicious, which generally preuails over the retiring habits of the virtuous indigent. This was one circumstance abou the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aucoin was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his employer sent him for the pursuit of a fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging character, with which he generally walked the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the unluckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracted state of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immaterial wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of countering the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to present himself to his friend, and beg him to renounce that chority and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed him; for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking freely and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and ruffian scenes of excitement, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the mints of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, the letter seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His friends insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. He had been discredited, that his contempt for the adultress had riot originated in hatred of her character; and that he had required, to enhance his own gratification, that the victor, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, during his depravity, thrown even the mask aside, and had not conspired to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose characer had not shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let slight circumstantials pass by unnoticed. He entered in the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the engagement of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyes followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been made, which would most likely end in the ruin of an honorable, though thoughtless girl. Losing time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, intimating him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were merely as he supposed all would be upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a letter, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was preverited. Lord Ruthven noxt day solemnly sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hold any suspicion of his plans being foiled by Ayre's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself at Athens. He had fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that appeared, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slavery, had hidden them beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the mode of a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could be appealing to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or lumbered along the mountain's side, one would have thought the girl a peculiar type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, opparently the eye of animaled nature, for that sleepy luxurious one of the animal suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light slep of the wind accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kamerunutterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who sometimes forgot the letters he had just decyphercd upon an almost effaced sheet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Her tresses falling, as she flitted around, and shining in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very objecthe had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe emotions which all feel, but none can appreciate? –It was innocence, youth, and beauty, which affected the crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future children, she would stand by, and watch the magic fingers of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circulations of nature upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the arrival points she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, referring to subjects that had evidently made a deep impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and excitement of the story she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amids his friend, and maintained ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the flesh of a young female to prolong her existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of her idle and horrid habits; but she persisted to him. The names of old men, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the stamp of the creature's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged the in, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of such monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, succeeded in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutherfeld.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected witnesses.\nAll of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the almost fairy tale before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, setting a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to keep his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed altogether the rightful proprietor of them. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the most frank infantile creature he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer ony one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, when her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the noise from the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross the path. Aubrey heard some of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, the very name of which apporeritly made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had insplored them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night alowed the power of these blows to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spikes which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage up into the devoured country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and when he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the open foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnings seomed to fall and radiate at his very sight. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadfulness through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the gale of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel which had hoordly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost unbroken sequence; he was at once led: but, roused by the thunder which again roiled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the witness, however, guided him. He was apparently unpunished; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in communication with someone, whom he immediately sejzed; when a voice called, \"Aga in baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glore of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he barrelled through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incopable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the lighs of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatched roof collapsed on very indivdual straw with heavy flakes of snow. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had alarmed him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress borne in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a dream arising from his disturbed imagination; but he immediately saw the same form, when he unclosed them, streched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; and there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacking as the evil that once dwelt there: up her left arid breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having entered the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously shouting with joy, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly suffocated, and Aubrey was comforted by the presence of her husband, who had lately been the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what he thought –his mind was blanked and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a nakcd dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their loud cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the public of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe the grief was impossible; but when they ascribed the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; they died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most virulent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Iantbe—by some unaccountable circumstance he seemed to beg of his former comrades to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon learning of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the prisoner recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now replaced with that of a Vainpyre; but Lardrick, by his kind words, pledging almost perpetual support for the cause that had caused thoir separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed scarcely affected; he no longer appeared that apathetic creature who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to find his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparent ly engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of their orbs, circumnavigating, like our world, the moveless surface;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nHenry's mind, by this statement, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguised him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of soliloquy and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins ho had formerly frequented, Ianthorpe's face stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in the shade of the modest violet; and, suddenly turning round, would be, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bilterations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit her parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to remember what they gazed upon. They heard rumblings, but they gradually began to see these reputations, which they imagined were on the part of individuals, who knew whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon reaching, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tarrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had to repent the mistake; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant the guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating thoir example, relented for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unending slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and toke them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the mystery. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contours of his own mind, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately threw up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Avrey induced them to carry his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having secured upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their conduct than they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's stature rapidly decreased; in two days mortifiction ensued, and death seemed imminent with hasty steps. His conduct and attitude had not changed; he remained as inconspicuous of pain as he had been of the occurrences about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than his usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not inasmuch as I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I have but little–iny life ebbs and flows–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know from me, my honour were safe from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown far some time in England–I—I–but life. \" It shall not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising his hands with exuberant passion, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by every part of your nature respects, that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, what over may come, or whateuer you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with the man rose upon him, and he knew not why; when he remembered his room a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mountain, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first bright ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had moved to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the exact rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relived, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to come in to take him to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those engagements be had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing feveral weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and exclmining the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he had in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were like in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way homo, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, the farm ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind beeame almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that his dear had fallen a victim to the depravity of the Devil. He became insensible and silent; and his only occupation consigned in urging the speed of the postlions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, carried him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was no more attaching herself to a man.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gained the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light happiness which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the intelligence of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfrost or a oolour may attend—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs which had deslroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the joy of his union? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the darkness of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more than once that her presentation should be delayed until her husband's return from the service, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the \"busy world.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and gazed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feign interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the horrors he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protections of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been used for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at some little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He proceeded the room with hurried steps, and fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were afraid his brains were burst from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances stacked up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He repeated himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung up from his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insolation. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by mourners, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to meet, turned round, and revelled to him the features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was almost distracted. Before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more frequently was it engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster's living again pressured upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions went unheeded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explicate to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The instant he went, the innkeeper was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this morister to roam, bringing ruin upon his home, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been altogether mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing seclusion and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noonday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down somewhere fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, induced people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from his pursuer swifter than any from before. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious look were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last induced to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remoristrancy proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of protecting him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily experienced in his travels, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they induced a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. He would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glossy purple; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself on the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afficted her, he would demand that she not touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even he could roufe him. This lasted many months; gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of his recollection, which his guards observed, several times a day. On the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians, residing his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking he was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey was pleased, and astonished still more by his expressing his intention to attend at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was evidently again capable of being affected by the influence of her beautiful smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being ever more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak in his wonted language, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every appearance; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the possibility of her future happiness, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monstor, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, compelled her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he impored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacisy him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he lea-\nWhen he was deemed sane, his exultation and pique could hardly be concealed from those upon whom he had conveyed this information. He hasteried to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to count–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crawded earth, save with her to whom he attached himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of servation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accentions;–in short, he knew how to follow the ferpent's art, or such was the will of state, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubry, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, enjuring her, as she valued her happiness, her honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who held her in their arms as the hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whom he consented, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without reply to the busy company of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages banging on his ear. Aubrey grew almost blind. The curiosity of the servants at last over came their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an belpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the passage where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried from the room, speechless with rage. Walking on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, arid knaw, if not my bride to day, your servant is dishonoured. Worner said, \"Frail!\" He saying, he directed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage, finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was suspended, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desisted his sister's guard, might he called, and when the midnight hour had passed, herelated composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to find his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Great Indian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1891, we put into the harbour of Milylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both fleets of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walking, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the villagers, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Hmer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he paid Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity very much, and we had no hesitation in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an officer man, who conducted us over the mountain. It consisted of three apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room with a spocious coat-room annexed. They were strongly decorated: plasterer green-stained mantle, marble tabernacles on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fouritain beneath, which could be made to pass through the corridor by moving a spring fixed in the side of a statue of Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had merely a large mattress placed on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest, somewhat, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the corner: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the content. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's nouels; Schjller's Ploughshares; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of those books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Itallan and Latiri. The Mefslah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The third had been reading some books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; but be is otherwise very good. I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portion in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a lattice battlement, was covered by a flannel Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wine, such as \"laohryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream gided away, grapes, oranges and lime were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an arched wood back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and night's till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seal was what maybe termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which stood an ancient chapel. Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended from broken casements, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon surrounded by a thick cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and maple-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old fellow?\"\n\"And?\" replied I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last on the island, and remained with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who helped by weaving the articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One instance we know, which my old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-fhore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the excitement with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the run, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of considerable position, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are anxious,\" is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Isand of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognised the name of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our re-earnings at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc on some future day; but to know that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his Majesty's good name, which has been grassly slandored. He has been described as of an emotionless disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasurables. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be palpably gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. TUESDAY.\nReligion, sympathy, and brotherhood appear to guide all his acts, and his courting the purpose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thro' her inantitude.\nLONDON. No man can read the preceding pleosing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with censure, partially when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that august tribunal, where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's choracler is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-opposing conscience.\nTHE END.\nG. G. Kent, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "9": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Amassing the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin American churches; at which time, the suspicion becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could become corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the habits of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the devil existed, that vampyreſ nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckerſ fattened, and their veins became divided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the force, they positively and unanimous affirmed, that, about five years ago, they became extinct.\nIn consequence, a carpenter from Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been called to say, that, at Cassovia, on the fringes of the Turkmen Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing him down with his beard. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vengeful man; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposition to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and engrafting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resolved to take their accustomed remedy. A slake was driven almost severally into the heart and body of Arnold Paul, which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. That done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those fans who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agenemies of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better apt to stimulate the subject of the present services than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirm his infernal visitations solely to those whom he loved most while upon earth—tho to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and acquaintance.A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, the Vampyre sent. Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly bawl the native place, And suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain them of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, though they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must be forgiven, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless her with a father's name. That word will wrap thy heart in flamo! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must witness which free her from its lifeless grip; Then with unhallowed hand must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, was a lock when the Act of Protection's fondness was worn; But now is blown away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, till the world in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey also produced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved while in existence. But this circumstance must be supposed to have result from the sinfulness of her life, she being portrayed throughout the whole of the tale as a cornplete type of purity and innocence. The correspondent Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of adulteration, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a scientific, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a notice, necessorily devotional.\nIt is difficult to explain, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general use, there are several others likewise synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world, such as Vroucolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the country a nobleman, more remarked for his manners, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in it. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and plunge fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inner workings of the skull; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited into every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence excitement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, whether from the blushing of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the femalo hunters after his notoriety endeavoured to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection. Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-roams since her morriage, threw herself in his way, and endeavoured to put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:–though in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her urbane impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But when the magistrate and ultress could not influence even the general direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wicked man; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular comrades, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who formed the basis of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sustained it by their vices.\nAboul the statement, they came to London a young gentleman by the name of Avrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortitude, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenarian subalterns, he cultivated in his imagination his judgment. He had, hence, that high feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that viole was thrown in by Victor once merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of the cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the habits of poets were the necessities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers favoured him, and which should descrude with least truth their lavishing or romping favour; the girls at the same time, by their brightening countenances wher he should be approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into their notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wattles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of sleep, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had removed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstance we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impudence of forming an idea of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external effects, but the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing the imaginationian to picture every thing that slanted its propensity to extrovagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always registered. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon bankrupt, from the notes of preparation. Streets, where he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his interest, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for in any generations has been necessary to enable the young to take some preliminary steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whcnever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to marry him. Flattered by such a mark of esthetic superiority upon him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the crossing waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many might disapprove of his act-\nWhen others were exposed to his view, the results drew different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his libellousity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubreyauld not avowed remarking, that it was not upon the unfortunate, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes of life, or even upon virtue, that be bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to indulge in his lust, or to sink him still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporculunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigenes. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: those upon whom it was bestowed, invariably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either thrown to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his campanion searched for the centres of all fashionable vice; he entered into the spiril of the far-flung: he betted, and almost always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his rival, and then be lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same uncaring face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful navice, or the luckless father of a numcrous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstrudedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fury than that of the cat which while dallying with the half-deceased mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent houses, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the silence of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farting of his late immense wealth, which to buy even more to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. He wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–far each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the most wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the consternation of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination begat to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the medals of a neighbouring almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engagled, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing rioting but apprehension; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had not before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for fear. His guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and urged that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irrosiſtible powers of soduction, regarded as disgusting habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that, his victim, the part of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtuosity, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and depravity. It was also fine, that all the female's whom he had hitherto desired, appareritly on account of their vices, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of these vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose choracter had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, promising, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no suspicious circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entored into the same circle, and so perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eyes followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innooent, though altogether less likely. Losing time, he entreated the assistance of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly expressed him his intentions with regard to the lady, intimating him at the same time that he was aware of him being about to murder her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have for such an occasion; and upon being pressed whe-\nThe man, when he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remand of their prisoner, he directed his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of her Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day mercifully sent his servant to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hold any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey took his steps towards Greece, and following the Peninsula, soon found himself at Algiers. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and there accompanied him in trawling the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments which appeared, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and deceased, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to place on canvass the promised hope. Of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pavement, or tripped along the woman's side, many would have thought the girl a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated passion, for the sleopy luxuriOUS look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole hefty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, and the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered up to an almost indecent time, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Never would her tresses faltering, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it would excuse the forgetfulness of the observer, who let escape from his mind the very objecthe had before him of vital importance to the principal intropretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, you see, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling crowds. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a meinorial memory during his retirement hours, she would stand by, and watch the ragged effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her former place; she would describe to him the circling dance up and down the open ploin, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talcs of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she told, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence, in the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he endeavoured to laugh her off of some idle and horrid fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, often had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the dreadful appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persisting her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at any coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutherven.\nAubrey Hogan seemed to attach himself more and more to Marian; her innocence, so contraslated with all the affections of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, in marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more on and more attached to the almost fairy form befare him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some alcoholic research, he would depart, determined not to return till his object was attained; but he always found it imposible to fix his attention upon the ruins before him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thaughls. He was unconscious of his love, and was still the same infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favourite haunt, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hands of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several witnesses, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his operations, which was to detain him for trial. They waited a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever reinstate, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the territory of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denoured the most heavy evils of impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey saw the light of their representatives, and tried to talk them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infemal pawer, the very name of which apparently made them all freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aury set off upon his excursion attended; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of those terrible fiends, had infected them with such terror. When he was about to depart, he came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he refused. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the borizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to rouse up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the storm begins, and although he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick beavy curtains forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took off, and he was carried with reckless rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismissing, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the house, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the suppressed, exultant mockery of a lavagh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with determined effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, when he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in company with someone, whom he immediately dismissed; when a voice called, \"Again mistaken!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as they broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Arnold, unable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They advanced; the light of their torches fell on the stone walls, and the batch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flaps of silk. At the house of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her company; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more hurst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his beloved conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visitation from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same farm, when he unclosed them, straggled by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her body that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat wore the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many brigh and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died upon her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacuums–he hold almost unconscionably in his hand a raked dagger of a peculiar construction, which he had found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the cottage, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their circumstances would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were consolable; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the heir he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying some reparation for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship had quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic creature who had so infuriated Aubrey; but of course as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of melancholy contemplation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile still haunt him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was almost entirely engaged in watching the tide and waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orms, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a man.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had hitherto so distinguised him now seemed to have deserted him for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silenchant as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form would stand by his side—if he sought her in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidsl the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; the latter suddenly turning round, would stand, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wound throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every circumstance of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the lender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a reception could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from criminals. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the irish habitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more as guides than as a fence. Upon entering, however, a narrow pass, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipice, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, plucking themselves together with rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment into the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the prisoners shoud climb up and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to his knees. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Rulhven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy consent of counsel.\nAubrey soon induced them to convey his wife and friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being contentedly to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had given an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his head became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my husband, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Avrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would once clear all you know of me, my life were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It shall not be known.\" –\"Swear!\" He addressed the dying man, raising himself with exultant enthusiasm, \"Swear to all your friends and all your relatives, by all your nature feasts, that, for a whole year and a day you will not part your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His face seemed burrowing into their coats: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he fell laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey went to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstantial circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a chill came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the room in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his ship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, but the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rucksack on which they had found the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convincing himself that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a company in which he had met with such terribleness misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslitalious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a cafe containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the destruction of the victim. There were several dagger wounds and abrasions. Whilst turning them over, and examining some curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further purchase, he touched the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no force certainly; they seemed almost to be bound to the ground; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the hands and feet, were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerned the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and they had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's heart became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and sombre; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the post-works, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; and the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and embraces of his sister, his memory of the past. Is she before, by her infant daughters, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that luminous brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from fortune, but from some feeling within, which appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. The step was not that light footing, which strays where a fly or a colour may attract—it was tense and pensive. When alone, her face was never rightened by the smile of joy; but when her husband breathed to her his affections, and was in her presence sorrowing those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were playing in the language of their own peculiar sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been bought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed till her brother's return from the continent, when he would be her protector. It was now, they resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overcame him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashioning strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe circumstance was extraordinary–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royality, had come thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that dreadful place—he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, whispered in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of meeting a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crawd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were breaking from his brain. LATEST. Ruthven again besotted him–circumstances starred up in dreadful alarmly–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a distant relation. Leaving her undor the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him the features which he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of spectators who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He didn't dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost dazed. If hitherto his mind had been absorbed by this subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainly of the monster living again prostrated upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was then that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He then uttered a few words, and those terrified hor. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wickedness; but death, he remembered, had been already meted. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his bedroom, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly from the insanity which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as indifferent to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed peaple to follow him; but they were soon separated from him, who fled from pursuer swifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, so whom in his presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious not to fail, in spite of his oath, a man whom Lord Ruthven appraached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious look were so striking, his inward habits so visibile, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strangly. Wher, however, marriage proved unavailible, the guards thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those inclinations of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take careful care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at once so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and reflection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a desponding state, and not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incidences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, on one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician about the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantaneously. Aubrey's attention was attatched; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. It was apparent that he was again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage to a person so distinguised for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a look upon her breast; opening it, which was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so inflamed his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trashed it under soot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he didn't understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed the monster, for he– But he would not advise–it seemed as if that voice in his head bade him repeat his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lard Rulhven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought nothing but of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to doay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and succeeded.\nLord Ruthven had arrived the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one elfe. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deceased in January, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former employer, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and intereft in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His life had dangers and toils to recover; could speak of himself as of an indivisible having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of proservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at once to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for forcing the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the same day before his departure for the continent.\nAubry, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to summon the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few days that marriage, on which he denounced them with the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, and they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in the morning found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with age. When on the spot, Lord Ruthven spoke in his ear—\"Rehrember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is disestablished. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his fellows, who, surprised by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey had no support for himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicjan was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness grew; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desisted his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relented publicly what the reader has pervsed—he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to apprehend Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's father had glutted the thorns of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Provider his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Malta.\nHolland, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies far out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser hargaining for trade with the natives, the clergymen and myself took a rainble to the cave called Homer's Scully, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylene, when I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very goodman. The cottage over the head, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zcchines for 1l, (about £250 in local currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca boat often to the distant islands.\"\nThis accusation aroused our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our constable had resided. We were immediately received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a dressing-room annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grocer-stained walls, marble table on either side, a large mantilla in the centre, and a small fountain basin, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large cream sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bed chamber had merely four large mattresses spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillaw—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, somewhat, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the room: it was open, but we did not think ourselves just.\nHe succeeded in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Vanney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's Protocol of the Robbers; Milton's Paradife Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1846; several small pamphlets from the Greek presences at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The manuscript was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The officer had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frighten me far a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pawn to an aged Armenian woman in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house afterwards was pleasurable. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The floor, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey oarpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furriished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking liquors, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frittat, and enjoying the cool breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustered together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden chair was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings on and off till two o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for him was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of red vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascade, until it was first in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea seems as clear as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a short distance on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distantly observed, studding the light blue water with spotts of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but my inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Minick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armerian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And what can you tell me, old friend?\" I said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not intended to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last up on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave apples to children, horries to cows, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Good Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we observed, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the coltage thought proper to disclose. He had known a beautiful girl, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had given her a plano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informality with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing what the ramblings in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecclesiastical habits which mark peculiar character. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in compony with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been same year from home; but \"Childo Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Caxton in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the thought of returning to Marylebone on some future day. It seems to me that you will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite interesting, and in justice to my lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contriving in any way to sooth its troubles, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from some little anecdotes. All the greater feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his emotions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for recognizing him as a man in whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her protection. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling fond of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Rports are ever to be regarded with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's attention, is the true mark of a virtuous heart and self-confident consciences.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-street, Fleet-street.",
    "10": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Poulin\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be peculiar: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in the territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautified. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief persisted, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; while these human blood-vessels fattened, and their veins became dislended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unarbitrarily affirmed, that, about five years before, a clerk Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampsyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his hands. This prevention, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, any persons complained of having been lormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attocks. To prevent further complications, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emaciated at the mouth, nose, and ears, and full of world blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes in his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, so that they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who suffered them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChilwell bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is not directly related, but it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment of death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased was not on his own doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth, to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBul first on earth, as Vampyre sent, take the corpse from its tomb and be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; By your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drooling the stream of life; Yet loathe the barrow which perforce must feed thy livid living cells, Thy victims, when they yet expire, must know the doom for their sire; As cursing thee, as cursing them, thy flowers have withered on the stem. But one day how far thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—The word shall warm thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freckles of its lifeless hue; Then with an unhallowd hand must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in the past, affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then slalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, till the so in horror fear a Froin spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his collection a wild and beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represcribed as having returned from her grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved while in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innacence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account of his travels on several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have borne an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrations and testimonials of its effects, has put forth several learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian evil.\nMany interesting and intemperate remarks on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a journal, largely devoted to explanations, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one most general acceptation, there are several others synonymy with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoula, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the entertaining parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his charms, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in it. Apperently, the light laughter of the fair only attached his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those places where such lossness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain whence it came: soine attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flinging upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a heavy ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His pecuniaryities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasured at having him in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, and from the hush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, when its features and outline were befuddled, many of the female huriters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some morks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the muse of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his attention:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were unperceited; –evidently her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indeferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuoso wife and innocent daughter, that no one knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wicked man; and whether it was that it even came to the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those men who form the boast of their sex from their domestic vices, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortitude, while they relinquished the most important charge of his mind to the care of internal subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and chastity, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was thrown in Paradise merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he though that the misery of a confinement chiefly consisted in the vesting of clothing, which were as worm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the real things.\nLilies of life. He was handsome, frank, and charming: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay cliques, many mothers surrounded him, bidding which could be with least truth their languishing or romping favours: the daughters at the same time, by their brighlening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Appealed as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that corralling pictures and descriptions contained in the many volumes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relaunch his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe dismissed him; and the difficulty impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man so enthroned in himself, who gave few other indications of his observation of external objects, but the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the absence of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a myth, and deluded himself to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him compliments, and so far advanced upon his career, that his position was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's friends were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessory to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the carcer of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitberto Ayre had had no opportunily of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposited to his witness, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent causes to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Avrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunes attending upon virtue, that he beowed his oats; these were sent from the door with hardly sufficient seeds; but when the public came to give him something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generolly prevails over the retraining and fulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still indelibly impressed upon his mind: all those upon who it was entrusted, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject mifery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he enflered into all the spirit of the far-flung: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he would do even more than be led; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he genially watched the society round him: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed sort of against his law—this abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more floridity than that of the cat whilst gazing upon the half-dead man. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the satchel that had drawn him within the reach of the fiend; whilst many a father sat melancholy, amid the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy his present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the greater extent of money, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the prisoner: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the accused. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that happiness and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not belong to his own. He promised it; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this neuer occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the many wild and rich scenes of nature, was much the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly endeavouring to break the mystery, which his exalted imagination beguiled to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he kept him in daily attendance on the morning circle of an Italian counsellor, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another infamous city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impalience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonified him; if it had before entered into his mind that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, and that the possessor possessed irresistible powers of seduction.\nThis rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his conduct for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had desired, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dowry to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all the females whom he had sough, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had refused to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gazette.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to strike the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnotified. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is exceedingly rare that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore induced to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all directions, and he discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though pretty, girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly conveyed him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of him being about to murder her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avrey retorted; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the course of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Roberts next day inerely sent his servant to secure his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plan having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romance, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, he found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon accupulated himself in tracing the distant record of cliccent glory upon manuscripts that apparently, as born of chronicling the deeds of freemen only befare slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as he himself, exuded a being, so beautisul and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pajnter wishing to paint on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pavement, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor description of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of cultivated riature, for that luxurious look of the animal suited but to the last tastes of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubry in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncannoyed girl, engaged in the purse of a Kashmere hutterty, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered up on an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If her tresses falling, as she flitted around, expiring in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which we all feel, but no one can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and fancy balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magickal effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the eircling dance up and down the open avenues, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her past. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she described, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amid his friends, and maintained ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong her existence for the remaining months, his blood would run cold, which is why he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fancies; but she continued to give him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obligated them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these ministers, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtuosity of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Dutch girl, still he found himself more, more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from home, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that identified alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and honest being he had first known. She always felt compelled to part from him with reluctance; but it was becausse she had no longer any acquaintance with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in finding or destroying some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appeciated to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, with horror at the very mention. In consequence, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever reach, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and derounced the most heavy wrath as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. He made light of their representations, and tried to laugh off the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was saddened.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melaricholy face of his host, and was horrified to find that his words, mocking the belief of those harrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, the prisoner came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, and he allowed the prisoner of the so bejesus to be put in custody, he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon here was one of those great crowds which, in the warmer climates, so suddenly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devastated country.He at last, though, moved his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern reaches, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and as he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fountained lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled stands. The animal lost, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brush.\n-ood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pecuniary storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman iningling with the stifled, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over him, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was appareri-\nHe was thus unperceived; for, though he called, he sounds unconinuated, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some person, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh ensued; and he felt himself being grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain. He was lifled from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his companion threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hand upon his throat when the glare of any torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, dislurbed him.\nHe instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, which he had broken through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now till; and Avrey, incapable of moving, was so heard by those without. They clashed; the light of the lanterns fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the direction of Aubrey they saw her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again enveloped in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lantern once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his legs. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lips; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was bled, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men rushed, crying, and simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was violently suffocated, and Aubrey was led by the side of her who had longly been to the aid of so many bright and happy spirits, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost uncannily in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastraphe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at each other, and rushed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubroy being put to bed was seized with a most violent fainting, and was almost delirious; in these intervals he would throw himself upon Lord Ruthven and up in a most unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former comrades to spare the woman he loved. At other times he would make threats upon his wife, and regard him as her enemy. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whom witness, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and commenced his confinement. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and distressed at the sight of the hideous image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, imploring his repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and even more by the affection, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic creature who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conduct began to be rapid, he again gradual retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this statement baunted him. During the first stage of the prisoner's recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wisps created by the cooling brine, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the noveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a man.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was very weak, and that elasticity of spirit which had hitherto distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for happiness, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood. Athens; when he found it amidst the ruins he had formerly occupied, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought it in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in the midst of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would stand, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded arms, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him and bound by the terider care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit some ports of Greece noither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individvals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended danglers. In consequence of bus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrawindile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock crashing down from the neighbouring precipices, they had no opportunity to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whale of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed repetition of several guns. In an instant their guards had loft them, and, placing them behind rocks, had begun to furl in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment towards the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being temporarily detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting violence, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey ran to his assistance; and, no longer hearing the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was even more disturbed by their conduct–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their colleague should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decayed; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconcerned of pain as he had been of the circumstances about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vengeful, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than superficial earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not in life, I heed the death of my existence as surely as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Avrey. \"I need very little–my hands are aching–I cannot exploit the situation–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my hands were free from stain in the mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" exclaimed the dying man, reviving himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all that your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not pass any knowledge of my illness or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whomever you might see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he fell laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey returned to his bed, but did not sleep; the many circumstances relating to his acquittal of this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came upon him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon their reliring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it would be exposed to the first old ray of the sun that rose after his death. Aubrey saw it, and taking hold of the men, determined to go andbury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the gun, although the robbers swore they pointed to the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clotts.\nWeary of a courtry in which he had met with such terribleness misfortunes, and in which all apparentlypired to induce that suuperstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilst waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to effect the effects of the violence. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his joy may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular features, the fame vorying them up an the haft and sheath were alike in splendour both, and left no room for doubt; there were small drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, to Rome, his first inquiries were making the lady he had attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the deft thief of Hindley. He became morose and silent; and his only expression consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a quarrel, which concerned abedient to his will, soon wafled him to the English shares; and he hastened to the custody of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infrequent caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, he was more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room assemblage. There was none of that light happiness which only exists in the warm atmosphere of a well-decorated apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indwell a soul conscious of a brighter future. Her step was not that light foating, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. Her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affections, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have changed her mind so that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own peculiar sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed on the meagre food which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangulations, when his mind had been so torn by the horrors he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exceedingly large–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious for us to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, surrounded by all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had scarcely courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this occasion of his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rutbourn looked before him–circumstances started in dreadful array. He roused himself, he could not believe it possible—the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; but when he attempted to ask questions concerning Lord Rulhven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights ago with his sister to the assembly of a near relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recoss, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were coming, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most aboriginred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servanters who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in addressing them, he again heard that authoritative voice call to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, so reached home.\nAvrey became a master abstractor. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complacent was it now that the certainty of the future's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheoded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt change. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath swore him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his secrets, who would love him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but such, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only with his sister Cecilia, who, with eyes streaming with tears, begged him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and soliloude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that mill which haunted him. His teeth became loose, and he wandered, as exposed to the noon-day sun as to the in-night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at length he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced from him who fled from a pursuer more than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, whose presence they were unconscous, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his shame, all that he knew. Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his habits so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that Hannah's mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Hannah's parents.\nDesperate of saving him from the injuries and fuffsings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of proventing him from exposing to the general eye any marks of what they considered foul play, they engaged a phyſiciari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so profoundly was his mind abforbed by one terrible circumstance. His annoyance became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is ought, da not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into unconsciousness, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences beeome less frequent, and his mind seemed to have lost a portion of its meaning, whilst his friends observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe boy had nearly clapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to confer with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning knowledge, of which they feared he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with some society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intent to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was evidently again affected by the influence of her loveliness, for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more subject to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished by rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm.\nHe flew in a fit of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the possibility of her future marriage, he behaved as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that witness again bade him remmber his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rutbven was following him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning in the drawing-room, and had spoken with no one else. When he heard of Aury's ill health, he readily understood him to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had tears and oils to recount; could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy witb any being on the crowded earl, save with her to whom he addressed her; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of state, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he accepted an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness.\nShe owed her own honour, and the happiness of those now in the gravo, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which she denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised he would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mother of Miss Aubry by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hooke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, and they gradually strolled away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, when one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the parlour, where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wheron on the way, Lord Rulhven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonored.\" Women are \"frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had burst a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relaled composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The reputation of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle from the villages, the clergyman and mysels took a march to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been staying. On the brow of Mount Ida (a smoky mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival on his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to marry Milylene, as I am likely.\" They get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has put an old man in charge of it: he paid Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred shillings for it, (about £250 English customs,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but not always; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-sloor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were not particularly decorated: plain green-slained walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain in the back, which could be made to flow through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largemouth couch or sofa constituted the furnilure. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a glass window. The bed chamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stufused cotton quilts and a pillow—the cammon bed used throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a merchant seaman's box in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. In the bottom half of the recess lay Voltairo's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousséeau's works completc; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English books of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal riotes, written with a pencil, in Italian and German. The Mess was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The Lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie untill his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move about without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking carriages, except twenty shillings which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brough here for service. Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the finuted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work combs, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath which a covering of fine coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking liquors, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the eening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we approached the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental woaden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his hours and nights till twelve o'clock, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive arid myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple opposed a majestic view. A small stream arising from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The setting sun, arid an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrifies the view in every direction; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small isles were diftinctly obscured, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I have enjoyed a better life than I did this; but our enquiries-\nAttempts were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our correspondent, \"could tell.\" I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had no time to visit the Armenion, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned many young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and silk to the girls who received by means these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the parents of his children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we communicated, to have a very ecoentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we must mention, which our old friend at the court thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piario-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Messina; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy in disposition, and those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriving at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company witb Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, wha had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him with Milylene.\" We had never heard of his lordship's name, as we had only some years from him; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Caxton in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in reference to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to assocializing with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man whose holy Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her inantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his habits or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral irresponsibility; and he who dares defend himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may conspire the errors of a fellow-mortician. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and wise-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printcr, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "11": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superposition upon which this tale is told is very general in the East. Among the Arabs this appears to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could become corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondorful stories, still extont, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight violence, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres night imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and subsequently died of consumptions; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became dislended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passagos of their bodies, and from the very pares of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, incredible account of a porticular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appeared, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unmistakably established, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had come to say that, at Cassouia, on the fringes of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; and, about twenty-one or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of food by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptions, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid light. Prisoners having been thus obstructed, they resorted to the accustomed remand. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same manners were adopted with the corses of those porsons who had previously died from vampyrism, and they should, in their turn, become agents of others who survived.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his own turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it was more adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Europe it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in exile, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his intimate visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nFirst on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corse shall from this tomb rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; The first on earth shall be thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the marrow of life; This shall be the banquet which witness must feed thy living corse, The victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing him. The flowers are withered on the stem. Butane, that for thy crime must be forgiven, The youngest, beth beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name. That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yel, thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glacial glance must view Whose head freezes over its lifeless blue; The last unhallowed blow shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest promise was worn– But now is borne away by thee Majesty of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than thou.\nMr. Southey was also produced in a wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arab maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the best loved woman in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travolf of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his real work on this subject, besides a variety of illustrations, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a scientific, and not as barbarian error.\nMany documentaries and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition must be added; though the present shall suffice for the limits of a book, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in different parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the first of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, here occurred.\nFrom the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sirigularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the scene around him, as if he could perceive some miraculous occurrence. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair maidly attracted his attention, that he might by o look quell it, and throw his hand into her breasts where excitement reigned. Thoso who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pass through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed so much upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent exclamations, and now fell the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagment their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, whether from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and appearance were beavtiful, many of the female hunters after his acquaintance attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountaineer, to attract his notice: but in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffling, and she left the field. But although the common adultress could not influence even the gaze of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indeferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vices, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their fortune from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died when he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of regimentary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which had dally ruined so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathy with virtue, and bought that vice was thrown in by Provdenoe merely for the pique of the senses, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the reolities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reason, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which they could describe with least trifle their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into ranks of his peers and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tollow arid wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life from any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compunction in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dream, when the extrordinary being we have already described, crossed him in his career.\nHe struggled with the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man utterly absorbed in himself, who showed few other signs of observation of extornal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: but, allowing his imagination to picture a creature which flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to serve the will of his mind, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far persisted without his notice, till his presence was altogether recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's offices were embalmed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guard, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the direction of equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pique, occording to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunily of damaging Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the witnesses offered different explanations as to the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the burglar, received from his hands more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not refrain from remarking, that he was so impoverished, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that be refused his alms;–these were sent from the door will hardly provoke sneer; but when the prisoner came to ask something, not to satisfy his wants, but to enable him to be low in his luft, or to sink him further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which general prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the more indigent. There was another circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was still more impressing upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the low floor and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent excitement with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashion and vice; here he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the kerbown sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he surrounded the young novico, or the unfortunate father of a numerous family; then his very will seemed fortune's law—the apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with considerable fire like that of the cat whilst dallying with a half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the respectable life he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this folly; whilst many a father sat bitterly, amidst the speaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single shilling of their late immenfe wealth, wherewith to buy over sufficient to support their present habits. Then he took some money from the garnbling table; but immedately lost, to the regret of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to refer back to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him an opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his company, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted magination began to appear the appearance of something supernotural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he must him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the municipals of another most deserted city. Whilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impaticnce; the first was from his sister, breathing nolhing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter excited him; if it had before entored him in his imagination that here was an extraordinary power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vioious, for that the possession of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his reputation and that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pirinacle of unsullied honour, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sent, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expiate the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon finding one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to offer no plausible pretext for abandoning him again, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and there perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is custom that an unmarried female is not dealt with in soclety; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though useless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, intimating him at the same time that he was aware of his being anxious to meet her that very evening. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were the same as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, he said, \"I think that mother has died.\" Having decided that he must accompany his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to make other arrangements, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The signature was prevented. Lard Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to obtain his complete assent to a consultation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interference.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek, and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded traces of ancient Greek monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Undoubtedly the same age as himself, she had a face, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the failed in Mankind's paradigms, except that her eyes spoke too much mind for him. any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typician of her beavtics; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparenlly the eye of animated riature, for that sleepy luxurious eye of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light of day often accompanied Andrew in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauly of her body, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who sometimes got the letters he had just decamped upon an effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray something delicately brilliant and vividly fadulous, it might be the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the valuable object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper introduction of a passage in Pausclosures. It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by enclosed drawing-rooms and stifling balls. But why attempt to describe arms which all feel, but none can appreciate? Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and labour the magic effects of his passion, in tracing the scenes of her former life; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plaice, would present, to him in all the glowing colours of youth and memory, the marriage pomp which she remembered seeing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatura tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the long-lost vampyre, who had passed years among his friends, and deep ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence through the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh his way out of such idyllic and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of several old men who had been last detected living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetito; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their accusation, always had some proof glove, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She told him the tradition and occurrence of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all led to a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man out of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more, more attached to the almighty fairy form besore him. He would tear himself away at length, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was established; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins before him, which in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possession of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile creature he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they, with several present, affirmed their evidence, pale with horror at her very name. Shortly after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he would necessarily pass through a wood, which no Greek would ever remount, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and donounced the most heavy violence as impending upon him who dared to cross the path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them recoil at his daring thus to mock their superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the megalomaniacal face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, he saw the corpse of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, but he had not at night allowed the power of these being to be put in effect; he refused. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the hinterland there was one of those speckles which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous explosion, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, howeer, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick grey rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilft the blue forked lightning seemed to falter and radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entarched forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached.\nHe struggled, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the peltings of the storm. As he approached, the noise, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant laughter of a man, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: bul, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the moon, however, guided him. He was apperently unperceived; for, though called, still the proceedings continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice exclaimed, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of large torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was raging still; and Aubrey, capable of mouing, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thalc loaded every individual spot with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had escaped by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the glow of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the clunky form of his fair conductress brought in a bundle. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a viscera arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, streched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyr!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vifions, now fallen with the flower of Isabella that had died with her. He knew not what these things were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into refloction, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciencia in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they appraached the body, foretold the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To communicate their grief was impossible; but when they identified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was almost delirious; in the so intervals he would call upon Lord Rulhven and upon Miss Cantwell–by some unaccountable combinatoryion he seemed to beg of his former comrades to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at that time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constable. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was surprised and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Marshal; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying a most repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and further by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showcd, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence ceased to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixated intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but it still haunted him. DURING the last fortnight of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engagcd in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of the moving orbs, circulating, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared almost to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's intellect, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastically as spirit which had once so distinguished him now feemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had habitually frequented, Marian's form stood at his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in the midst of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his imagination, her pale face and wounded body, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which caused such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Routhven, to whom he held himself best by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but although they thus bounded from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were of the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the jealousy of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, how over, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the adjoining precipices, they had occasion to repent their riegligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detested by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and committed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the culprit. Hordly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Russell received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' foces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and fled.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their conduct–they being content merely to guard the place until their comrade should return with the promised sum, of which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and he seemed afflicted with haemorrhoids. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaware of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last engagement, he became apparently uneasy, and his eye became fluttered up towards Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than his usual earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's happiness. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life goes apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all yur nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to every living being in every way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their fockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altering his acquairitance with this man remained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the preseritiment of something horrible awailing him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a soldier met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the prison of a neighbouring mill, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his departure. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of his men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers had they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered by conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terribleness misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to hegemonize the superstitious melaricholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While wailing for a vessel to corvey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to effect the destruction of the victim. There were several daggers and atoghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently manufactured in the same style as the dagger discovered in the farm hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarily shaped, the sheath he held in his band. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be close to the dead; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the varying colours upon the hoft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe lofted from Winchester, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deposition of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of France. He became morose and silent; and his inward agitation persisted in urging the commencement of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his falhers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine careſses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated almosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was constantly lit up by the light of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeclared to indicate a soul consoious of a brighter future. Her step was not that light footing, which stray where a butterfly or a crow may attract—it was slow and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed upon her his affection, and would in her present forget those griefs she knew deslroyed her heart, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he would be her principal. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of introduction into the \"busy scerie.\" Aubrey would have rather remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the meloncholy which overpowered him. He could not feel better. He detested the frivolities of friends and strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hasened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, beedless of all about him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blow him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed upon his friends almost refusing to bear their weight, he was compelled to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hand upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burrowing into his brain. Lord Ruthven again befare him–circumstance for starting up a dreadful array–the dagger–was at his throat–He roused him; he could not believe it possible–the dead man again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be recovered.\nHe determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Praising, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turried round, and reverented to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street. At the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice shout to him—\"Remmber your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was at once discharged. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again presed upon his thought? His father's alteritions were now unheedable, and it was in consequence that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slurred him; was he really to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his back, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicion, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became ragged, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnights damps. He was no longer someone he recognized; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest when fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuers closer than any could be thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by mistake the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, and his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so deeply. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, believing that his mind was coming alienated, they thought it high time to resume in that regiment which had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirée of saving him from the injuries and suspicions he had daily encountered in his wars, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take consular care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had been emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy luster; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the appearance of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, scizing her hands, with looks which had evidently afflicted her, he would desist her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Once again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incidences became less frequent, and his mind began to take off a portion of its guard, when his guard observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his friends a definite number, and then miss.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to confer with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so precarious a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Tinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them all by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and exceedingly accomplished merit; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, which was his surprise at beholding the face of the monster who had so long occupied his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upan her asking him how he could recognize the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, far he– But he could not agree–it seemed as if that voice again bade him repeat his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthvon was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and policeman, who had heard the whole, and thought it was but a return of some disorder, entered, and forcing him to look at Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, he pleaded, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been dismissed with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this inforination. He returned to the house of his former companion, and, by cousin attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother affected in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could restore his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles beyond count; could speak of himself as the son of an individuol having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earl, so with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had beguiled to seem worthy of preservation, if merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fact, he knew so well how to use the serpent's tongue, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The little of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for haretening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's degraded state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the prisoner and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, corijuring her, as she valued her own hoppiness, her own happiness, and the honour of those naw in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours their marriage, on which he denounced the first heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Avrey by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. Night passed on without rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey read, with a horror that may more easily be described than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew most frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Rutbven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him from the room, seething with rage. When he reached the staircase, Lord Rulbourn whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister has dishonored. Women are frak! So saying, he pushed him tawards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the prisoner was afraid of claming her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Lorond.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desisted his sister's guineas might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Routhven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had complained the day of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRA RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, who had to choose his place of rest, and Providence was his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vespers, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of the same name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattles and vegables to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and since it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Scotland, its bourities amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bollom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and me took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) We met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in this felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to go to Mitylene, where I am likely to be married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the head, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trador, six hundred zecines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen years, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all perfectly decorated: pale green-stairied walls, marble tables on either side, a large fireplace in the centre, and a small fountain basin, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a large bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chalks, and an empty boak-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painling. The bedchamber had merely a large mattross spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common fare throughout Grange. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with hooks and papers, which were then in a steward's chest in the close: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in opening the compartments. In the bottom of the recess lay Voltaire's, Speare's, Boileau's, and Roussoff's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Romans; M'Ton's Paradise Los, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with memoirs, written with pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was densely seribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, some of which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until he returns; for he is so paralular, that were I to move on anything with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce from this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, including twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is customary in Greciari architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was supported by a fine Turkey corpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"Ichryma christi,\" and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream flowed away, grapes, oranges and limes were clumping together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a rambling seat with an ornamenal wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"he was praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led one eye to Mount Carmel, covered with live and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestie decoy. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty ohesnut and palm-trees, several small islands could distinctly observed, studding the light bluewave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless on the name of the person who had resided in this romanlic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, a banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I hope he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" I said, \"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we found several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had portioned several young girls when he was last upon the island, and exchanged dances with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boot for a fisherman who had lost his arm in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared, from all we collected, to have a very ecclesiastical and bonevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper to close. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forle, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informatjon with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; ovrimaginations all on the rack, guessing who the rambler in question could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark a liar were gone. Arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been traving in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"of whom you are so curious, if Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I have since visited him again.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Catherine Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every way. Neither did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justiceto his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contriving in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as can be plainly gathered from those little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendemess, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the repose of Solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Christianity hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not consider a right to give an opinion. Reports are supposed to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of his fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his praise. To keep a good secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuoso heart and self-approving consciences.\nTHE END.\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "12": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is faunded is very general in the East. Amnesty for the Arabians. It appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only maintained its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churchef; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually extinct, and formed the subject of many wonderful legends, still extant, of the deceased rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it occurred, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austrla, and Larraine, where the lies existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain quantity of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; when these human blood-sucker's fattened their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular occurrence of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautious conduct, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that several persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted the doctor Hadclgni, took up the body, and found it (which is supposed to be usual incases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emaciated at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed recourse. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been struck. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the exception of those persons who had previously withdrawn from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who had survived the disease.\nThe universal belief is, that a prisoner sucked up a vampyre, becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief clerk.\nThis remarkable occurrence is particularly related, because it soems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the penal servations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.A supposition aluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse must be rent; Then ghastly haunt the notive place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet from the blood which perforce must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, when they yet open their mouths, shall know the mercy for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flaw shall be writhed on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloud of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her eye's last tinge—her eyes's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view her freckles of light blue; Then with unhallowed hand must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, was a lock when her Affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Memorial of the loss of your life! Yet with your own best blood still flow; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also produced in his wild but beautiful prose of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre cousin of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is reputed as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being poured throughout the whole of the tale with a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account from his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, which he pretends to know.\nHe was to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forward some learned arguments, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany more interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to ecclesiastical matters, and which may best be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several terms synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucoocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the pleasure parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed up at the mirth about him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt his sensation of awe, could not explain why it came on: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not desire to penetrate, and at one point seemed to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His reputation caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the welght of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never seemed to take a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong motion of passion, though its form and appearance were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at first, some measure of what they might call affection: Lady Morcer, who had made a mockery of every monster she had seen in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, lo attracl notice:–though in vain:–when she stood near him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still gazed as if they were regarded;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But when the common adultross could not influence him even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female species was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and intelligent daughter, that few know he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulsion of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it evor overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boost of their society from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of considerable wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortitude, while they entrusted the more important charge of his management to the care of mercenarian subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of banour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He wished all to sympathetically.\nHe thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vestiges, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irreducible follicles and other coloured patches. He regarded them with virtue, and thought that ice was thrown in by Providence inerely for the picnuresque effect of the scene, as we see in romances. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the necessities of life. He was handsome, smart, and rich: for various reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the earliest time, by their brightering countenance when he approclched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not in the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pictures and descriptions contained in those voluminous books, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being was above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an ideo of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the lax assent to their absence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon learned, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this peculiar character, who, till now, had only expressed his eurjosity, he hinted to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the youth to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are presented as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They communicated, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Richmond, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a man of character from whom, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly associated it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of slagging Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, though many more of his actions were expased to his view, the result yielded different conclusions as to the parent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in liberallty; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to satisfy their daily needs. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the virluous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes of life, and even upon virtue, to which he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed resentment; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to satisfy his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was scorned away with rich charms. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicarious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous individual. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed upon his mind: all those persons upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were either led to the faff, or sunk to the lowest and the first abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised to the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cudgels of all fashable vice; there he engaged into a game in the spirit of the far table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his adversary, and then he lost ever more than he gained; but he was always with the same unchanging face, which he gerrily wagged the fociety around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of a young man, or the luckless falher of a nmerous family; the very wish of fortune's law—this abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with his dead mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn as the circle be adorned, cursing, in the solitudes of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within thereach of his fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speoking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of their late masters we were with to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he postponed his friend would give him an opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutledge in his carriage, and amidst the many wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the childish excitement of vairily wishing to solve that mystery, which to his exalted imagination seemed to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey far a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morriing circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of an important event in the city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the other's were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residont in his comportment, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, considered his licentious habits dangerous to society. It had been proved, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated from his hatred of her characler; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, thathis victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had endeavoured to expose the whole deformity of their vice to the public gaze.\nAUBREY DEFEATED.\nCrushed upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, promising, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstantial pass by unnoticed. He entered into the circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly visited. In London, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him the same thing that he was sure of being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were merely as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to murder her, he again laughed. Aubrey retorted; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remand of their proposed marriage, he ordered his serjeant to seek other employment, and, calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was deferred. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; he did not hint any fuspicion of his parties having foiled Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory up into monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltring soil or many cured lichen. Under the same roof as herself, occupied a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour out on canvases the promised hope of the salvation in Mahomct's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much inind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gaze a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the eye suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncorruptous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the remarkable beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effused tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading colours, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe characters which all fancy, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, uninfluenced by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the curious dance up on the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatura tales of her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief in what she narrated, excited the imagination even of Aubry; and often as she told him the tale of the living phantom, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced him, last year, by striking upon the life of a young female to prolong his imprisonment for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasics; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, when last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the slamp of the fiend's appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believ her, for he had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their accusation, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the tremendous opposition of these monsters, and her horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all lended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ann; her loyality, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an educated Grek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would learn something at once from her, and, forming a plan for serious antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an acquaintance who seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unashamed of his love, and was ever the same frank informer. Being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourites, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive band of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, but several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey proceeded to perform upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the policeman, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, and the day had closed, without any consideration. They described the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most unholy evils as proceeding upon those who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, inserrial power, the very name of which appeared to make their blood freeze, he was saddened.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his companions, and was concerned to discover that words, mocking the belies of their human fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer months, so rapidly gather into a great and murderous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was almost overwhelming–its echoing thundors had scarcely an interval of respite–its thick heavy cloud forced its way through the conopying foliage, whilst the great forked lightning seemed to fall and strike at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, under the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbour's yard of a hovel that bardly listed itself up from the remains of dead trees and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the starm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriek of a woman mingling with the suppressed, almost mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost broken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which had rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, knocked on the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apperently unperceived; and, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" He heard a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the grate: the enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, he placed his hands up to his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole which gave light in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, loaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the brims, as ho broke through the wood, was heard. The storm was now raging, and Avrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched far her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches suddenly burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought him to a life-changing position. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stench about her place that seemed almost as attaining as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of someone having opened the vein:–to this the woman pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now falling with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts wore–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconscienciaably in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had engaged in the search of her whom a mother had misidentified. Their frequent cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the public of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief was impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Avrey, and went to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable occurrence he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him, whose image he had now confused with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, implying almost reparation for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attentiveness, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeased that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again produced into the same state of mind, and Aubrey received no different treatment from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of ralicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the sensation startled him. During the first stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breezes, or in following the progress of the moving orbs, or, like our world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to clear the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by his own account, was much weaker, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have deserted him for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form stood by his side; if hc sought it in, the woods, her foot would appear warring across the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; and then suddenly turning raund, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded hands, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the loan he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Glasgow no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to know what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the inattentions of individuals, whose interest it was to impress the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few men, more to serve as guides than as a guard. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; so scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had reached them, and, placing themselves bohind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile, but ashamed of being distracted by a foe, who with insistent shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting suspicion that any of the robbers might climb up and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of their enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Russell's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon such terms, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being contracted merely to guard the entrant till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Rutledge's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed certain with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer him assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may savo me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as much as the passing day; but you may savor my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs and flows–I can't explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my life were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for any time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant vigour, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by every your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, what may happen, or whatever you may soe. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Avrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the pre sentiment of something terrible horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and his comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given him in loyalty, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed to the ideritical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had been acquainted with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to heighten the superstitious rarities that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him either to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself arranging those effets he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of violence, more or less intended to ensure the death of the victor. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst watching them over, and examining their curiaus forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the kitchen hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it was filted, and peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certification–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he refused to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same colours upon the haft and sheath, were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for far doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in bidding the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he hold dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and there he hasteried to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the arms and coresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infrequent engagements, had gained much affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which garners the gaze and opplause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a cremated apartment. Her left eye was red lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholic charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul consciences of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother was near, he gave to her his affection, and would not in her presence forget those griefs. She know destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of his voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been married.\nShe addressed to the world, it having been thought by her friends more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her principal. It was, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not care intornoost about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his wife. They soon arrived in town, and pro-rated.\npared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had riot been held for a long time, and all who were anxiously to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened to see it. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same flure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first introduction into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear his weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as though he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had made up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be reversed; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in eliciting insolation. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there brought himself up to his knees devouring tumblers. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he rushed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several persons, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him the features he first abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAucy became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it overwhelmed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressod upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst things he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hands to free the world from such a shame; but he must, be remmbered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing spirits and folitude, he left the house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that iron which haunted him. His dress was collected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnigh damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever danger overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were constantly distanced by him, who kept from a pursuer more than any one from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the happiness of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose protection they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxiously to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all when Lord Ruthven approached him in earnest. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious look was so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was first obliged to beg of him to abate from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remarriage appeared providential, the clergymen thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alieriated, they thought it high time to resolutely enforce that rule which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDefirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had so recently encountered in his wanderings, and preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take immediate care of him. He hardly appeared to hear it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His indiscretion became at last so great, that he was confirmed to his chastisement. Then he would of lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recolection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks which severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to drop him. \"Oh, do not touch him! Is your love for me is aught? Do not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to who in he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This last occurrence occurred several months ago, but, as the year was passing, such incidences came more frequent, and hence threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guard observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then forget them.\nThe time had already elapsed, when, upon the last day of the ear, some of his friends entering his room, began to confer with his physician upon the strange circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when he was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of the mark of retaining intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in company, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his pressing his intent to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. He answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently in a state of being affected by the influence of her presence; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the seelings of affection. He went to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and illustrious accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; upon seeing it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster wha had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reputation of her future husband, he looked as if he had not understood her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he–When he could not advance–it seemed as if someone's voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, one of the guardians and physicall, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but the return of his disorder, entered, and, upon learning him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he impored, begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard about Aubrey's ill health, he readily assumed himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was diagnosed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, and, by constant attentions, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had had years and toils to recover; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any boing on the crowded street, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could telegraph. How, since he know her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for securing the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the happiness of those now in the grave, who had held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their lives, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he declared his most heavy conviction. The seruants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aroy by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nigbt passed without reply to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be comprehended than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless young woman. He seized the opportunity, while one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the aparlent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, struggling with him. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if my bride dies on this day, your sister is dishonoured.\" \"Women are frai!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding rest, had broken a window, and he was conveyed to hospital. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his friends might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be expressed composedly what the reader had caused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT FOR LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Gregoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vespers, in the year 1882, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain suppositions of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Brits to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, the bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, on the bank of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took charge to a cove called Homer's Scoot, and other points, where we had been besore. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek, our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who had left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I would not go to London, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old mantle in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecbines for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not consistently; for he stands in his garden very often to watch the diffused islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were subsequently received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a large office annexed. They were all densely decorated: plain green-covered walls, marble labels on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small sountagne heneath, wbich could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chalks, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bedchamber had merely a large maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pjow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet, was open, but we did not take our liberties in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recorder lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empies; Zimmerman, in the German language; Stockstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantines, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with margin notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The M'Siah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and desired to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so paralular, that were I to move one here without orders, he would frown upon us for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Constantinople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externolly was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pilasters with black plinths and fret-work corniccs, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The floor, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are furnished, as many them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a great streamlet glided away, grapef, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of some large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which, we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cavered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades.\nIt was lost in the woods near the mountain's summit, until it was found in December. The sea is clear as glass, and an arc unshodowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, upon a vista of lofty chestnut and palm-trees, several crag-mall islarids were distinctly observed, contrasting the light blue wave with spots of emerald grecn. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic union: none knew his name but Domini nick, a banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our coroner, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Good Testaments to the poor children. In short, he seemed to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. From this circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the coltage thought proper not to disclose. . He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shores, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, conjecturing who this rambler in Greehoe could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy in disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiarity genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Catherine Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the likeness of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite unincomfortable, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with man nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his action, and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion has set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"clits\" without feeling proud of him as a regimentaryman. With respect to my loves or pleasvres, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be regarded with caution, particularly when directed against man's character integrily; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the actions of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "13": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the belief becoming prevalent, that a Latiny body could become extinct if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, sensational and extenuating, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West the belief spread, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres generally imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to slow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chlef and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Svia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's gravestone, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a notorious man; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, any persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, picked up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely sinewy, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and foul odour. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven severally into the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been shot. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into a grove. The same precautions were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a magpie becomes a magnet himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChilwell bailiff.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better adapled to illustrate the subject of preserit observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal immolation solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth–those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection–A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre spirits, your corse must be rent; Then ghastly haunt the place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loath the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victors. When they expire, shall know the demon for their sire; as cursory as you are cursing them, thy flowers are withering on the stem. But one thing for thy crime must fall, The greatest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name— The word shall wrap thy heart in glory! Yel, thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must be mustw which freezes on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also intimuced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is repressed as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence.\n-ence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her wife, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Turner gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variely of onecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some leamed dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classica, as well as a barbararian evil.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horriblest superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, purely devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are so many others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucooka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened in the early hours of the morning.\nIn conditions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularity than his rank. He gazed up at the mirth clround him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtless habits reigned. Some, who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a loaden ray that weighed upon the face so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a welcome, whether from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after his trial attempted to win his attentions, and gained, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every monster she saw in drawing-rooms since her marriage, endeavoured to make herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mourning-bank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled indignation was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet so was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few know he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the repulsion of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who make the boast of their sex from their diabolic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan and had an elder sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. According to him, by guardians, who thought it perfectly merly to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his life to the company of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feigning of holiness and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' accounts. He believed evil to sympathetically with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence mere for the pieturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and variouf coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the habits of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay ranks, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their braying counselances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into their notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his salaried hours, he was surprised at finding, that, exposed in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the act of snuffing, there was no foundotion in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pietures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, overtook him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibllity of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed few other signs of his observation of external objects, but the total indifference to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their gaze: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the affspring of his fancy, rather than the person be for him. He became acquainted with him, paid him compliments, and so far carried upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon sound, from the notes of conversation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, till now, had ony whetted his cravings, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appeor as if fallen from the skies, when such scandalous intrigues are mentored as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They agreed, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fattered by this mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that, when many more details of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his liberally; the idler, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than they could possibly want. But Aubry could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the voracious, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was something curious about the charity of his Lordship, which was never more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the contours of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he struggled, and always gained some succesf, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and there he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same vivacious face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his vory wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of interest was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than those of the cat which was lying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent neighbourhood he adorned, sitting, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him within the reach of this fury; whilst anyone a foot from him, under the speoking looks of mute hurrying children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith he could buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling court; but immediately lost, to the fury of rage, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this might but be the result of a certal degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charley and pleasuro which proved the ruin of his business, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbaven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was altogether the stranger: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which from his excused imaginations began to assuage the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost desert city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; as it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his passion for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to ensure his gratification, that the victim, the part of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vendor, down to the lowest abyss of irfamy and degradation: in fact, all the females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole depravity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubry determined upon one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point upon which to strike the eye. He attempted to invent some plausible pretence for abandandoning him altogether, proposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no suspicious circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and so perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the doughter of the house whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is said that an unmorried female is not dealt with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in his windirigs, and he discovered that an investigation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the murder of an innkeeper, whom he thought might be guilty. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his intention about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed she would have upon such occasions; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a letter, to say, that from that moment he must decline assisting his Lordship in the reinstatement of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of what he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the child of his Lord. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthen next day merely sent a servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by any interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the forged records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering cloak of many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the mode for a painter wishing to pour upon canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any man to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced up and down the plain, or tramped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparantly the eye of an animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unfortunate girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who read the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hue, it might well excuse the forgetful forgetfulness of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object he had been looking for.\nThis passage is of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Poussarias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawlng-rooves and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effect of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to projects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural talismans of her profession. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, excited the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and closest friends, for whom he fed every year, by feeding upon the life of a young female fernale to prolong his existence through the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to talk her out of such wild and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, having at last detected one living creature among themselves, and several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she heard him so excited, she begged him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he will be sound him if more andmore attached to the first female form before him. He would tear himself away at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attested; but he always found it impossible to fix his aim.\nHe gazed upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the most perfect pauper of his troubles. He was unconscionable of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She sometimes seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skotching or uncropping some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with solemn present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the prisoner, they all at once warned of him not to turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through wood, where no Groek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres during their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the greatest evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them look at his head thus to mock his superior, infernal power, the very act of which apparently made their blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had infpired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, as night allowed the power of these locks to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into enormous masses, and pour all their rage upon the devoted citizens. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climes, is almost instantaneous; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had adjourned.\nAs far as the power of the storm was above—its echoing thundershad scarcely an interval of rest—the thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopy of trees, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse bolted for joy, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugher, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which exploded over his head, he, with sudden effusion, ran.\nHe committed suicide outside the door of the house. He found himself in utter darkness: the sourid, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceited; for, when he called, he remained silent. The seconds continued, and no notice was taken as him. He found himself in conflict with some one, who he immediately seized; when he did he cried, \"Again baffled!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was impossible: he was lifted from his spot and hurled with enormous force against the wall. On seeing him his cousin threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the torch loaded on every indiaual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the defilement of Aubrey he searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches became more intense upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeline. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a viscera arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the female form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even on her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the life that once dwelt there:–up her neck and breast was blood, and up her throat were the marks of teeth having entered the vein:–to this he pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her mother, who had lately been the object of so many bright and happy vivacious appearances, now filled with the sorrow of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into reflection, and take refuge in melancholy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar character, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her which a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; many died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent sever, and was often delirious; in these circumstances he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable circumstance he seemed to beg of his forbearance to spare the being he loved. At her times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her thief. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and dismayed at the sight of him whose appearance he had now combined with that of a villain; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying most repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic creature who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conviction began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apperently engaged in watching the tides and waves raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless seas;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had so distinguished him now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Rulhven; but much as he wished solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form stood by his side; if be sought it in those woods, her light step would apperent wandering amidst the undecorated, in quest of the modest violet; her head suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every one of which contained such bitter images in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit some parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thou hast-\nThey seemed from place to place, yet they seemed unable to identify what they gazed upon. They heard much about robbers, but they gradually began to dismiss these reports, which they imagined were only the inention of indigent folk, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from notorious criminals. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the authorities, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow depression, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock broughl down from the neighbouring mountains, they had reason to regret their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves upon rocks, had begun to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, stopped for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile, ashamed of having thus detained a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to this instance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him, and the guards having, upon Lard Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to carry his wounded prisoner to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death proceeded almost immediately with hasty stops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconfcious of pain as before. He had been of the usual conduct, but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became appareritly unwell, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as surely as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death would remain unknowable for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violice, \"By all your senses, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his desk, and breathed no more.\nAubrey relived his rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstancos attending his acquaintance.\nHis acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the company, when the robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaole of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose above his head. Aubrey astonished, and taking some of the men, determined to go and bury it up to the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the suitor he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they picked out the identical rock on which he had laid the body. For some time his mind was lost in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy which had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and on Friday arrived at Smyrncl. While wailing for a vessel to convey him to Ortrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Riva. Amongst other things there was a case containing sixteen different weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the vicar. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apprently ornamented in the fame style of the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—having endeavoured to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be close to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the samo varyirig tints upon the hft and sheath were alike in colour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of these proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a ship, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted ashore to the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and care of his sister, all memory of the past. If the girl, by her inferential caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light nobility which only exists in the beated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mood beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter future. Her step was on that light footing, wither there are where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence spare those griefs she knew destroyed his heart, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on his face were then paying in the language of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet been presented to the world, it having been thougth by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch for her on her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his fathers, and fed upon the megalomaniacal which overpowered him. He could not feel jest about the frivolities of fashionably dressed girls, when his mind had been so torn by the events she had wilfully neglected; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in tow, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened to enter. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engendered in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized to a well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his eyes most refusing to bear thoir weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with sober steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were escaping from his brain. Lord Mayor again before him–circumstances remain.\nHe thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It came up in dreadful array—the dogger—his oath. He roused himself, but could not believe it possible—the dead man again! It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and here gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he disguised himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and exclaimed to him that his features be most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurrying step, forced her down the street: at the door he found himself blocked by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, he soon reached home.\nAubrey was almost abstracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon him? His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monstrosity, bearing ruin upon his breath, amid all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sifter might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes coming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and soliloude, he left his house, roaming from street to street, anxious to fly that image which had haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and be wandered, and was often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to help him; but they were soon distanced by him when he fled from a prisoner swifter than any had been. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idea that he must by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whom they were unconscious, he determined to entice him again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, that society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the defendants took up pro-pose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been so imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDearest to saving him from the injuries and suffering he had daily inflicted in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye the marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to remain in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, for compulsive was his mind occupied with one terrible crime. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was conveyed to his chamber. He would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had lost their glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with loins that nearly enveloped her, he would desire her to louch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, so that not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a pall of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, asked him to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelligence, from which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in company, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intent to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his father was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lively smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more a receptive to the feclings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a fit of rage, and trampled it with his foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a most forbidding expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that sentence again bade him remember his oath–he turried suddenly away, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicari, who had heard the noise, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had collected the morning after the drowning-room, and had 18 refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had carried this inforination. He returned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his state, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had tears and toasts to recount–could speak of himself as of an indomitable character, having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his affection, had begun to feign a kind of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her sooty accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch having at length eluded him, he obtained an important consulate, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of his brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she desired her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servant promised they would deliver it; but, giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. He passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over came their vigilance, they maliciously stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with eyes bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurried him from the room.\nRage with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, he had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not inentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardjans might be concealed, and when the midnight hour had passed, he repeated precisely what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had suddenly appeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was before him, was to be his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put in at the barbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchandisers; and although it lies rather out of the way for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounces amply repay the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the serjeant bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schol, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain monticule so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scotland with an English lord, who left the country four days prior to our arrival in the country.\n[citation needed.] \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not wish to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to got married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not frequently; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in proceeding to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an en-rance hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet enclosed. They were beautifully decorated: ploin green-stained wainscotts, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play throvgh the bronzes by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brass vase in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnitro. In the ball stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had only a large mattress spread on the floor, with two small cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ours succeeded in examining its contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Shokspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's work, complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schillor's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels from the Greek press at Constantinople, some torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with medical notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literarily scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the last time he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; so he is so parsimonious, that were I to move an thing without directors, he would frown on me for a week or two; he is otherwise very good.\" I once gave him a kiss; and I pay the proprietor of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who lives in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house external was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and four feet wide, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work capitals, (as is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were distinctly higher than the roos. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkish carpet, beneath an awning of thick coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the cool breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustered together on the borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wreath back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his meals and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from his seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye vlew.\" A line of rich vineyards led one eye to Mount Calcla, covered with oak and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek lemple appeared in majestic decay. A stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the wood near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chosnut and palmar-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this remote settlement: none knew his name but Doinick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" He said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we found some valuable particulars on the isolated ord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the Isle, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who came by means of these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor child. In short, he appeared to us, from what we collected, to have been a very eccentric and bonevolent character. Orie circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom he was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the rudiments of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our immediate objectives.\nThey all on the rack, guessing who his rambler in Glasgow could be. He had money it was said: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FRSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years away; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcla in every way. Deeply did we regret not having been more careful in our researches at this time, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not only interesting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, altogether opposed to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is quite the reverse, as may be plainly gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his house. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his enjoying the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal. Over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a gentleman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with excitement, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimonial of a virtuous heart and self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prunter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "14": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wanderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the living and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, over Germany, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended in such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that Charles Cassovici, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, was tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the disease, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr.\nHe's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprivated of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the bady, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emollient at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and florid. Proceeding having been thus obstructed, they resorted to the accusatory remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with regard to those persons who had previously died from poisoning, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrance is here related, because it seems better adapted to illuminate the subject of the present observations than any other language which could be adduced. In some part of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal vices solely to those beings he loved most upon earth—those to whom he was bound by bonds of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corpse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the sacred place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, atmidnight drain the stream of life; Yet loat be the banquets which you perforce. Mvst feed thy livid living corne, Thy victims, when they expire, shall know the demon for their sire; as cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy slowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must not, The Lord, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy hearth in flame! Yet thou must take on by task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unheeded hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock had been shorn and Protection's first pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Memorial of their grief! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go—arid witbuds and Afrits rave, Till the so in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sullivan was so introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid. Oneiza, who is represented as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exilicence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulled from the sinfulness of her life, being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astringent cases of vampyrism, to which he professes to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrations illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting details on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, necesarily devoted to explanation, and which must be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in general acceptation, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of in various part of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the company of the dissipatians attendant upon a London writer, there appeared al the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblemari, more remarkable for its singularities, than for its rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughler of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a chance laugh at it, and strike fear into those hearts whero thought contemptuous reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose; but attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce the skin.\nIt did not penetrate to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a heavy ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had once exclaimed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleasured at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly bearing of his fae, which had lately gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of possession, when its form and appearance were changed, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mistress of every man shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. Bt though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the voluptuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed them to females. He had, however, the reputation of a man of torigue; and whether it was that it even overcarne the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of women, he was as often among those men who form the boast of their sex for their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nA bout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with his only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Lest also to himself by guards, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, when they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many young men' apprentices. He expected all to sympathise with virtue, and thought the misery of a cottage was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque aspect of the scerie, as we see in romances: he thought the miserable of a cottages morely consisted in the vesting of cloths, which were not warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregulor folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the torch and waxcandles which flickered, not from the presense of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of moving pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nThe very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in music, who gave few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensily to extravagant ideas, he on formed this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the offsprings of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was almost recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Slreet, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the care of vice towards putting themselves upon an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as is fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous events are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intenlions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from man, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubroy had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now felt, that, though many more of his habits were exposed in his view, the results offered contradictory conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneezes; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to reign in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his ignorance, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the reliring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance out of the charity of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which he passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparerit eagerness with which his campion sought for the centres of all foul-mouthed vice; there he entered into the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known cheat was a notorious fraud, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was all right with the fame unchanging from head to foot, with which he constantly watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful indiscretion, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed folly's low—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adored, curfing, in the sombreude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reacb of this fiend; whilst a mother sat frantic, with the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their preoccupation craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gildor he had stolen from the compulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certifiable degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the will of the more experienced. Aubrey then wished to convey this to his friend, and beg him to resign the charity and pleasuro which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he could not do it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and among the many wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the congenital excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily company upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of an almost desorted child. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affections; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had ever entered into his imagination that there was an evil pawer resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, contended, that his character was dreadfully unclean, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been contended, that his contempt for the prosecutrix had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abysmal of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all those fernales whom ho had sought, apparently on account of their ullitude, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not ceased to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey delivered up the baby, whose condition had not yet shown a single bruise point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning his acquaintance, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let any slight circumstances poss by observed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lord Mayor was endeavouring to work upon the unfortunate experience of the daughter of the lady whose house he called.\n-fly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, but thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Mr. Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at that moment that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say that for that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remonstrance of their proposed tour, he ordered his fervant to seek other apartments, and falling upon the other side of the lady, inform her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint anyone of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey continued his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Groek, and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of extraordinary glory upon monuments which frequently, accused of containing the remains of freemen and beforo slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same fame roof as him, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour out on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she donced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the girl a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, opparently the eye of animated naturc, for that sleepy luxurious look of the woman suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often accompanied Aury in his search after treasures, and often would the uncanscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almighty effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If would her tresses fluttering, as she flitted around, and shining in the sun's ray such dazzling and brilliantly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which we all feel, but few can appreciate?–It was innocenc, youth, and simplicity, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains from which he had sworn to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penknife, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would pair, to him in the glowing colours of youthful memory, the pictures she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural exploits of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, excited the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the story of the living vompyre, who had passed years together among friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feigning upon the life of a little creature to prolong their existence for the indefinite months, his blood would boil, whilst he clotted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible spectacles; but she cited to him the names of old men, who have at last detected one living among them, and several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wandered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernal power of Lord Rulver.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Isabella; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affeted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idleness of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself mre and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one whom she could visit her favourite haunts, which her guardian frequently engaged in sketching or uncropping a fragment which had escaped the destructive hands of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they had, with several pretences, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to put upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the enjoyment of the ladies in their nocturnal orgies, and denigrated the most boavy evils as imponding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representation, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superjor, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood boil, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unassisted; he was surprised to observe the murderous face of his host, and dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had filled him with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to turn, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so excited in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, can rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, how over, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost always unbroken; immidiately the sun sets, and night begins: and even before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was upon him–its thundering thunders had scarcely an interval of rest; its thick heaviness forced its way through the cariopulating fog, whilst the blue forked ligaments seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the eritangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a large tree that hardy lifled itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brackenwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he apprached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the stones. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a determined effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in company with some woman, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh ensued; and he felt himself grappled by a woman whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his wife as dearly as he could, he strangled her. His attempt was in vain: he was lifted from his spot and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands on his throat, which, the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole which gave way in the day, disturbed him; he insensibly rose, and, finding his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The fire was now out; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those about. They entered; the light of their torch fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of snow. At the desire of Aubrey he searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair coriductress brought in a lifelike condition. He shut his eyes, believing that it was just a dream arising from his disturbed imagination; but he then saw the same man, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; and there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attoching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her forehead there was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the mermaid pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been the subject of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the weight of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a brother had intimated. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To relieve their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call up Lothbury. Ruthven came upon him by some unaccountable circumstance he seemed to think of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would heap maledictions upon his head, and curse her as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Arnold, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant attendan. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apalhetic creature who had so astonished Aury; but as soon as his convalescence seemed to be over, he again gradually retired into the same slumber of mind, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intenlly upon him, with a smile of malicious expression playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coaling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once distinguished him now seemed to have slipped for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but inuch as he wished for salvation, his gaze could not find it in the neighbourhood of Kens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Bartholomew's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear as though wondering amidst the underbrush, in quest of the mysterious violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imaginings, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he felt himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that he should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet visited. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering.\nThere was, however, a narrow defection.\nAt the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock cascading down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whirling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several explosions. In an instant the guard had left him, and, placing themselves between two large rocks, had begun to fire in the direction wherice the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who constantly bellowed orders to them oduance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, is a number of the robbers shovld climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey rushed to his assistance; and, no longer caring the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till his comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortality ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty strokes. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaware of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the meeting, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! Assist me!\" You may save me–you must do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the dictates of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot expiate the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my life were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by a God your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not import your knowledge of my crimes and death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whomever you may see. His eyes suddenly burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to his room, but did not sit; the many circumstances attending his acquisition with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horribleness awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which ho had left the corpse, when a roger met him, and insulted him. It was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promiscuity they had had with his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first light ray of the moon which rose after his death. Henry afterwards apprehended, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clathes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the dental rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewled in conjunctions, but he at last returned, convinced that they had huried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to bring about that superslitalious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons employed, more or less intended to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a shawl apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the blade he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certification–they seemed perfectly clear to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints on the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on March, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on the blade.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under these repeated horrors; he was appalled that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of civilisation. He became suddenly rose and silent; and his only companion persisted in urging the spoils of the prizes, as if he were going to save the lives of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed contrary to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastoned to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she had, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affections, now that the women began to appear, she was now attaching herself a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not the winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exifts in the heoted atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind. There was a melaricholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeclared to indicate a sombre conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light fluttering, which strays where a butterfly or a crow may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was brighterened by the smile of joy; but when her brother returned to her house, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of his sorrow? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which animated him. He could not feel interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been tormented by the horrors he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They then arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had scarcely begun to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven appeared before him–circles started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself; he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had injured the imagc his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to obtain information concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights afterwards with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he returned into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, alast, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an adjoining room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in some communication; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those fecltures he so abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he suddenly heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey became most distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's coming again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were naw unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his accident. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was overwhelmed. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin on its breath, and destroy all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and declare himself a spy, who would believe him? He bought himself employing his own hand to free the world from this wretched wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streamlng with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. Lost, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street.\nHe was anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became ragged, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, concerned for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuer swifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by his own absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend almost upon them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered the room, his haggard and suspicious eyes were so straining, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at once obliged to beg of him to abstain from smoking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the gvardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that wrath which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandering, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, for completely was his mind absorbed by some terrible sorrow. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become congested, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to hurt him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, do do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom be referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Once again he sank into a slate, whence not ever anyone could rouse him. This lasted many months; gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences came less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which was so relieved, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to wham. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared they had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wanting to see his sister. He answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, slowing at the thought of her brother's being once more removed from the conditions of affliction. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at holding the features of the woman who had so greatly influenced his life. He seized the prisoner in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled him under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hand, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advise–it seemed as if someone's voice again bade him remmber his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was following him, but he saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and bought this was but a return of his disorder, cautioned, and forcing him from Mary Anne, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the burglary-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily assumed himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insensible, his exultation and pleasure could scarcely be concealed from those among whom he had gleaned this information. He hosted the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the bride and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount; could speak of himself as of an indomitable character, having no sympathy with anyone on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed him; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were mercifully that he should listen to her soothing occents; in fine, he knew so well how to do the serpent's art, that such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged slate,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAvrey, when he was left by the prisoner and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, requesting her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours their marriage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey, what he regarded as the ravings of a man. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that might more easily be described than described, the notes of hushed prepclaration. Morning came, and the sound of carriage broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The vigilance of the servants at last overcame him, and they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opartment where the bodies were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, he had broken a window-vase, and ho was conveyed to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the prisoner was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related conjecturedly what the roader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Messina.\n-ylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, it is bountifully repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser collecting for cattle will the stock, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Scoot, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am presently to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has put an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting-parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closets annexed. They were all simply. The furniture consisted of plain green-stained walls, marble columns on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small mountain beneath, which could be made to pay through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small brorize vanus in a circular position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Engish cane chairs, and an emply-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stitched cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest near the fireplace: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the desk lay Voltaire's, Schapare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Mesopotamia; Kotzebuc's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1881; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that were I to move on this thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week or more; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of his farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an old Armenian who lives in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pinnacles and frees.\n-work comices, (as it is now customary in Greek architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a large stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking right wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, as the streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of some large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the defendant passed many of his evenings and nights till two o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Carmela, surrounded with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshod by a single loud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of lofty cedars and palm-trees, feveral serpents islands were distantly observed, studding the light blue water with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Doinick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could telegraph, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt severa parlulars of the isolated lord. He had accompanied eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and celebrated with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to women who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One occurrence we had, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her herself the rudiments of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the place of Mystery; our imaginations all on the run, guessing who the rambler in Greeley could be. He had money it was evident: bad philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark his peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been so many years from home; but \"Childe Harwood\" being put in our hands we recognized the recluse of Collymore in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the time, but we consoled ourselves with the hope of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I repudiate this statement, believing it to be untrue and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, opposed to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its complaints. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their rightful seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his enjoying the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hath borne her mark. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral inlegrity; and he who dares justify himself enough to be found before that awful tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the errors of a sell-sword. Lord Byron's character is worthy of emulation. To do good in society, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGilllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "15": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present significance since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot destructively if found in their territory, it gradually increased, and has been the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and seeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and subsequently died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of replotion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1873, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary.\nBye Day. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously agreed, that, about five years before, a soldier Heyduke, nomed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vompyre's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and trial, many persons complained of having been threatened by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted the doctor Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as is supposition to be usual in cases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptions, and emitting at the mouth, throat, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadful as if he had been alive. When done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, so that they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked into a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tummy.\nChief hailiff.\nThe matter of rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece vampirism is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in exultence, the deceased is not allowed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal sights solely to those persons he loved most while on earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut here on earth, as Vainpyre sent, Thy corse ball from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the new place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loath the banquet which perforce must feed thy living coarses, The victors, when they yet expire, shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou destroying them, Thy flower are withered on the stem. But know that for thy crime you must fall, The youngest, best loved of all, God bless thee with a father's name—The word will wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last linge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's foridest pledges worn; But now is born away by thee Memoria of thine agony! Yet with your own hoarse shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bagging lip; Then stalking to your sullen grave, Go, and with Gods and Angles rave, till they in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thaaba,\" the story of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from her sinsfulness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourneur gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of fraud, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth several learned dissertations, tending to prove fraud to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting facts on his singularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deduced to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, the there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: Vroucolocha, Vardaulach, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London fire, there appeared at the various meetings of the leaders of the ton a man, more remarkable for his singulorities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could participate therein. Apparently, the laughter of the woman only attracted his attention, that he might by a look upon it, throw fear into those breasts where thoughtless habits reigned. Those who felt this fensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixed upon the object's face, did not seem to pulse, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the body; but fell upon the eye with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities allowed him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the bluf of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and ornament were beautifull, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some hints of what they might term affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the rockingery of every man shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but pay off the debt of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left him. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent censure with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning longue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of women, he was as esteemed among the females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who profess it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an unmarried sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who gave it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed himself to sympathise with virtue, and thought that money was thrown in Heaven merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their circular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and charming: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, have led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of his solilary hours, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles which fluttered, not from the presence of a ghast, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundatiori in real life for any of that congeries of pleas.\nSome pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Fearing, however, some compensation in the gratified kind, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his care.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of obtaining an impression of the character of a man ontirely absorbed in himself, was gavo few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the total assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of all contact: allowing his imagination to grasp every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a myth, and endeavoured to observe the offspring of that sancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, for instance, the notes of preposition in Highgate, the street he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this peculiar character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the duty, which for many generations has been thought necessary to induce the young to take some rapid steps in the direction of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skics, when certain scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of praise or of prclise, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of affection from man, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly acknowledged it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had the opportunity of studying Lord Rulhven's character, and now he found, that though many more of his actions were exposed to view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in dressing liberally; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; they were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to compel him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the general impotence of the vicious, which generally prevailed over the retiring hashfulness of the virtuous indigont. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevilably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashions and vice; here he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known prisoner was an antagonist, and then he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same unhinging face, with which he generally watched the proceedings, that it was not, however, so when he accompanied the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a rarified family; then his very will seemed fortune's law—this apprenticed abstractedness of mind was laid side, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hapless mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat fretfully, amidst the speaking language of mute children, with about a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tablo; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of those experienced. He often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasurable which proved the ruin of his life, and did not belong to him. He dreaded it; but he endured it–for ever day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sceries of life, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he seemed no more relieved from it than the coristant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whom first he went in search of the medals of another equally deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter especially affected him; if he had before entertained into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicarious, for that the possession of the irresistible power of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for female adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his lust, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and depravity; in consequence, all those females whom he had desired, apparently on account of their virtuosity, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposit the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detoured upon leaving, who said the character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight disturbances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is custom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his business in secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assizes had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thougth thoughtless girl. Losing time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to marry her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed a man would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, inerely laughed. Aubrey relented; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he would decline accompanying his Lordship on the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also conceiving the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was deferred. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and continuing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the found records of ancient glories and monuments that apparently, as a means of chronicling the deeds of freemen who unlawfully besorc slaves, had hidden themselves beneath sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as herself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the object for a painter wishing to pour tray or canvass the promised hope of the fortunate in Mahomel's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to think she could belong to those who had no fouls. As she descended upon the plough, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an unequalled nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suited but not the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butlerfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as she were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effused tablet, in the excitement of her sylph-like form. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had formerly thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe something which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crawded drawing-rooms and stinking stalls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he had shed to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effocuses of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the curious dance upon the open prairie, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful motherhood, the marriage pomp she recalled viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her past. Her earnestness and apparent belief in what she narrated, excited the admiration even of Aubrey; and often she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every man, by fceding upon the life of a young female to prolong his existence for the indefinite months, when his blood would run coarse, whilst he attempted to laugher her out of such idle and horrible habits; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetites; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and, as it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detail to him the traditional appearances of the ladies, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lard Rutven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the strange coincidence which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Isabella; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan of some antiquarian refearch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impassible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always sawined to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructions of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, paling with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed up on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the prisoner, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vandals in their nocturnal raids, and denounced the most heavy penalties as impending upon those who dared to disturb their peace. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, he became ill.\nWhen power, the very name of which clamped apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concurred to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible creatures, had irked them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put into action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon his devoted country. He at once, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilght, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and as he had advanced far, the power of the storm was abovc–its echoing tones had scarcely an interval of rest–a thick heavy rain forced its way through the over-opting foliage, whilst the blue forked lightening continued to fall and rage at his every feel. Only his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful reluctance through the entangled forest. The animal at last, throgh fury, stopped, and he found, by the glare of night, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, and at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the house. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unwell.\nNo one was received; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Accidental death!\" To which a loud laugh ensued; and he felt himself grappled by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet andhurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of several torches passing through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, seizing his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the breaking of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the direction of Aubrey they feared for her who had accompanied him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more came up near him, to perceive the airy farm of his fair conductress brought him to a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the wound:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously and with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A VARNEY!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was numb and seemed to shiver in refleetion, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the house. They were met by diffrent parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the grave. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often dolirious; in these intervals he would call on Lord Ruthven and upon the Queen; by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companions to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecise maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose company he had now connected with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the first stage of the unfortunate's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tide and waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of the orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's appearance, by this shock, was completely weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atheris; if he sought refuge amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Isabella's form stood by his side—if he remained in the woods, her lurching step would oppear lurking amid the underwood, in the presence of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, he would see, to his wild imagination, her pale face and swollen throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but when they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the curiosity of those who they desended from pretended thieves. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, through a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large inasses of rock rushing down from the neighbouring prisons, they had reason to repent their negligence; scarcely were the whole of the party engogged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the loud report of several shots. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering wall of the defile: but conscious of being thus detained by a count, who with insulting shouts bade them a divorce, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly bad they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the call or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' bodies around him–his guards having, upon Lord Russell's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbour's cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content inerely to guard the entrance till the wounded comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Rutbaven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with basty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of matter as he had been of the objects aboul him: but towards the close of the last engagement, his mind became apparitionly uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as surely as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"HARD?\" Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the why–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my bonour would be free from stain in the world's mills–and if my death were unknown for any time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself in an exuberant violence, \"Sorrow, which your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man remained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awailing him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robher met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been consigned by himself and comrades, up until his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring inourit, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, endeavoured to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, although the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had burled the corpse for the sake of the clogs.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Riva. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dog discovered in the fatal but—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he seized the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, although peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to hold no further certainty–they kept gazing to the hand bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; for the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Scotland, and on his way home, to Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had assaulted.\nHe proceeded to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivistic hand. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and he had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind was almost overwhelmed under so many repeated borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and he only concurred in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of the one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, wafted him to the English seas; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all inemory of the past. If she before, by her infidelity, had grieved his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was no more attaching him to a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the cheers and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmont. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind berieath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a foul conscious of a darker realm. Her step was light foot-footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract; she was fedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her breast, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if someone's eyes were then playing in the light of their own living sphere. She was only eighteen, and had not been present to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his parents, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He did not feel interest about the frivolities of life.\nHe considered strangers, when his heart had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened to attend. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner of the room, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly scized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had scarcely had the courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blow him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first introduction into society. He gazed till his limbs ached, and refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a guard, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were straying from his mind. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself; he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the instrument his head was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the question hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining uniformation. He went a few days after with his sister to the assembly of a near regiment. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his melancholy thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were living, he disguised himself, and entering an adjacent room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him the features he most abhorred. He sprang for home, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, led her towards the door: at the door he found himself blocked by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remain sober!\"He did not dare to look, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became most distracted. If so much of his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete was it erred, now that the conviction of the monster's guilt again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now ignored, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath starred him; was he then to allow this man to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspensions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been altogether mocked. For days he remained on this slate; shutup in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, and, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing sorrow and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the mid-night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening loaf, but at last he laid him down to rest when his fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dusted by him who fled from a purse thief swifter than any—from which he sprang. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a daughter amongst them, of whose condition they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so audible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so deeply. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to institute, and, fearing that his mind was becoming impaired, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and suffering he had daily encountered in his wars, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His irascibility was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he remained for days, in agony of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his wife; then he would something start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is august, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months; gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind lifted off a portion of its gloom, whilst his friends observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, endeavoured to communicate with his physicall upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Ayre seemed pleased, and astonished still more by his expounding his loyalty. He was present at the engagements, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her loving smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her face and, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a savage expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would not wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of her disorder, cautioned, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, compelled her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them not to delay him for one day. They, attribting this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with no one else. When he learned of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood him to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deceased in insanity, his condemnation and pique could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his fate, he producedally won the ear of Miss Avrey. Who could resist his power? His conduct had danger and toils to recall–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself;–cannot tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were only that he might hold on to her any longer;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the ferpent's art, that such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The interests of the elder branch standing at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the same day as his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, consoling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to day but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy circumstances. The serjeant promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he bought it betternot to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what be considered, the ravings of a maniac. Nigh passed without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of crosstabsences brooked no ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound went out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly asphyxiated. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When they reached the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" \"Wamen are frai!\" So scolding, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aurey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to her sister, who was riot prepared when examined, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptom's of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Arthur's sister had glutted herself with the thirties of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his pace of rest, and Providenco his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of the same name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of meat and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purse barging for cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been previously. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Messina, where I am likely.\" They get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wirie-trader, six hundred shillings for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there out fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felvcca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansions. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor–an enlrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all perfectly decorated: plain green-stclined walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain near it, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a largemouth couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a dozen English cane chairs, and an enormous book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottori quilts and a pink pillow—the common bedding throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were formerly in a large merchant's chest in the corner: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in exainting the contents. On the tablet of the recess are Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volncy's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Sehiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and surrounded with slabs of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed.\"\nHe forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until I return; for he is so pompous, that were I to move one bit with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of my farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted marble pilasters with block plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were four feet higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses are furnished, as upon them the Greeks spend their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryina chrisli,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breezes.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small sword.\nAs the morning glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the colonel spent many of his evenings and mornings till twelve o'clock, reading, watching, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout,\"and always attended our chapel twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be called \"the bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit on which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly obserued, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, the bankor, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, my friend?\" I said, \"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon He was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one son, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to the poor child ren. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought best not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shores, and he had bought her a piano-sleeve, and given her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infarmation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guossing what this rambler in Greece could do. He had much, it was evident: he had philanthropy in disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued at Palmers, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so excited, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recuse of Calcla from every page. Deeply we regret not having been more careful in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I quarrel with this statement, believing it to be quite uninclusive, and in justice to his Majesty's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as having an unfceiling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from the little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, ought to take their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his acts: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion has set her scal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No one can read the proceeding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his habits or pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with censure, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fallen-mortal. Lord Byron's character is that of a genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous mind and soul-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "16": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidor.\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is faunded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs this accusation seems to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Grecks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek chrvches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that the Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuly stories, till extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feoding upon the bodies of the young beauties. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hurghary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres generally imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers sated, and their veins became distended in such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the pores of their bodies, and even from the very pores upon their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyri.\nThe murder is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cofovia, on the fringes of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, and had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth from the corpse's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precion, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre again; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been frightened of him by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the knife, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the hcart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been struck. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a monster himself, and sucks in his own blood.\nChief Justice.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better suited to illustrate the significance of the present observances than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in exultence, that the deceased is not only compelled to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection. A supposition alluded to in the \"Greece.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse should from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the last of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy murderous corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are white on the petals. But one day, when thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spasm, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unballowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, which, in life, when shorn Abraham's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with your own best blood still drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then strolling to thy sullen grave, Go–and with Gouls and Angles rave, and the screams of horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also intruded in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre of the Arabian Nights, who if represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her wife, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefart gives a long account of his travels through severa astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretend to have borne eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a wealth of anecdotes, and historical narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbaric, error.\nMany documentaries and interesting notices of this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, not consequently devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Varnypre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several names synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a man, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the laughter of the fair only attracled his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and look fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object of face, did not seem to perceive, and at one glance seemed to peer through the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a sudden ray that so wet upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagling their attention. In spite of the dead-green hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the husk of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although his eyes and lips were beautiful, many of the female hangers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of respect in the male term affections: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shwn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a movable bank, to compel his attention:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; on her unappalled impudence he was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common female could not infuse even the corner of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and whether it was that they even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who define it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, the came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alone to himself by guards, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his honour, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenarian subalterns, he entertained more imagination than his judgment. He would, hence, that high romantic feeing of bonour and candour, which daily ruins so many millers' apprentices. He loved to sympathize with virtue, and thought vice was brought in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the same, as we see in romances: he thought the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vosting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving to compel him to defend with full truth their languishing or romping favours: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the low and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of light, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions conlained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensatory vanity, he was about to rejoice his dreains, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave much more signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit acceptance to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon fashioned this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to serve the offsprings of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was often recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, for the notes of preparation.\nHe said that he was about to rave in St. James's-street. Desirous of gaining some respect respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to form the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessory to enable men to take some rapid steps in the direction of vice towards placing themselves upon an equality with the aged, and thereby allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous journeys are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of prclise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flatter by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered contradictory caricatures from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality;–the lady, the gentleman, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosity, reduced to indolence by the misfortunes attendant upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; they were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or sink him further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the great importance of the vicious, which generally precludes the retiring bashfulness of the virtuosos indigenes. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the mast. MURDER. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubroy was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companions sought for the centrations of all fashable vices; there he entered into all the splrit of the table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was all with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the elder of a numerous family; then his wish seemed sort of contrary to law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the eyes of the cat whilst dallying with the dead mouse. In evory town, he left the formerly affluent youth, and from the window he adorned, contemplated, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking cries of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immaculate wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present needs. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; he immediately left, the ruiner of money, the last gilder he had just snatched from the grasping grasp of the innocent: this in fact. This might be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of those experienced. He often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and plea which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sconces of nature, was always the same: his eye poked less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for some time lost hold of his companion; he left him in good attendance upon the morning arrival of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astounded him; if it had before entered in his imagination that there was an evil power residuated in his companion, these letters seemed to give him sufficient reason for the break. His friends insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicissitudes, for that the possession as irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in spite of her charactor; but that he had required, to enhance his gratuitous enjoyment; that his victim, the partner of his guilt, be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had loved, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the full deformity of their vices to the public eye.\nAubrey inflicted upon him one, whose character had not yet shown a bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext far abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he so frequented. In England, it is custom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his business in secret; but Aubrey's curiosity followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, whom he thought harmless. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him to conduct with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately sending a note, to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of what he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevenled. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent a servant to confirm his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rame, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crofsing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in trawling the faded records of antiquity glory upon monuments that appeared, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath shellacking soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delirious, that she might have been the model for a pair of spinners going to pour tray on canvass the promised hope of the masses in Mahamet's praise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could be of any use to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mourning-man's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently an eye of animatod nature, for that sleepy luxurious eye of the animal suit, but to the taste of the human palate? The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after artifacts, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashinere buttersly, show the whole beauly of her form, floating as though it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her mysterious appearance. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the folly of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Poufarias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unfsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballets. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for future hours, she would stand by, and watch the effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circumstances.\nHer dance up on the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful passion, the marriage pomp she remember fondly viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the mysterious tales of her past. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she told, excited the utmost even of Aubrey; and osten as she told him the tale of the living vampyr, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest lies, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idiotic and horriblest fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old mermaids, whom they had at last detached one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's caprice; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been proved, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giving, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to consess it was true. She detailed to him the disgusting appearance of these creatures, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretentious and accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though during the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite his belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Rutherfeld.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Isabella; her innocence, so contrasted with the affected virtues of the women among whom he had struggled for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of Englisch habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost faltering form before him. He would distance himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the things before him, whilst in his mind he relained an imagination that regarded himself alone the rightful possessor of these things. He was unconseious of his love, and was ever the same frank irreligious being he had formerly known. She always seemed to withdraw from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeaused to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they, with solemn present, affirmed their existence, and expressed horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he would necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, and the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the custom of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy violence as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, and that he should allow the power of these summonses to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that the day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so suddenly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain farced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the tangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a boulevard which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him into the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shriek of a woman mingling with the stifled, vulgar mackery of a laugh, contrivance in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rumbled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found him in direct contact with one, whom he immediately addressed; when a voice exclaimed, \"Again hadled!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dear as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force upon the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands. Up in his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;—he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They collided; the remains of the trees fell upon the mud wall, and the thatch loaded on every side with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his sister conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a hallucination arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelled there: –up her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the infant pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A VAIN.\"\n\"What a Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had hitherto been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had dwelt within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and secluded to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties which had been engaged in the search of her whom a man had missed. The mournful cries, as they approached the city, foretold the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at each other, and pointed to the corse. They were insensible; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these moments he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At her times he would imprecate maledictoryis upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chartered at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whom ever opportunity, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his chief attendant. When the prisoner recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Mrs. Ruthven, by her kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had afflicted her son, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showcd, soon reconciled him to his presence. His appearance seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic man who had so astonished Aubrey; but on seeing as his deterioration began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze gazing jovially upon him, with a smirk of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this sinuously haunted him. During the last stage of the engagement, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tidless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, and marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like the world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to close the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthen; but much as he wished for salitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Alhambra; if he sought it amidst the ruin's he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light form would appear wondering amidst the underwood, in quest of the most interesting spot; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild gaze, her pale face arid wounded thro at, with a moek smile upon her lips. He determined to remember all the scenes, every feature which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Mrs. Ruthven, to whom he held himself responsible by the tender care he had taken of her during his illness, that they should visit the parlours of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollocation could be attached. But though they thus hurried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, over, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to the beads, and by the excited report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves upon some rocks, had started to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retraced for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who will not insult them or give them advice, and being subjected to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and strike them in the rear, they determined at once to rush for word in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedig the contours at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately lowered their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabaret; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being cont ent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's stature rapidly decreased; in two days inortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he remained as unconscientous of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind came apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer him assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need bread; my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from the world's mouth–and if I were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, addressing himself with exuberant violence, \"Swear by all that your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may bappen, or whatever you may see. –He seemed bursting from his sobs: \"I fain!\" said Aubrey; he sunk down upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his assailant a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presenliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by his friends and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking notice of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time he was bewildered in expressions, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the body for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of this country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apperently seemed to heighten that considerable melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilst waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had wit him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less intended to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst watching them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discavred in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastering to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, but was peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the hoft and the blade were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood upon each.\nHe loft a stone, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady who had escaped to safety from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's heart became almost broken with so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the depraved killer of Iantho. He became morose and silent; and his only interest consisted in urging the speed of the postions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his sister, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of her sister, all recollection of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was no description of that particular brilliancy which so exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded industry. Her blue eye was never lit up by the light of the lantern beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes, but from some feeling of melancholy, which seemed to inspire a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was on that light footing, which trays where a butter fly or a colour may attract; she was sedate and petite. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her prefer forget the griefs she had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuousry? It feemed as if those eyes on his face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next dressing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy house.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fancy strangulations, which his mind had been torn by the horrors he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arranged as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, a little distantly, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his formal entry into society. He gazed upon her limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He proceeded from the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid thoughts were flowing from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had created up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, not to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining inscription. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into his chambers, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that no one were leaving, he returned himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in some communication; he attempted to pass and get near her, when she, whom he owed to marriage, turned round, and revelled to him in a variety of features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sifter's arm, and, with hurried steps, forced himself towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in possing them, he again heard that woman whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became most distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by this subject, how much more complacent he became engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and he was in vain when she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified him. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him: was he to allow his master to roam, leaving ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He had thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only with his sister, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which imprisoned him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, often exposed to the noon-day sun as well as the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where a great fog overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his own agreement the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconfident, he determined to remain again in society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, those whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, reinonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allonated, they thought it high time to revoke all that trust which had been before instituted in him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of securing him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His irascibility became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. For he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had become a glassy liquid; the only sign of affection and recrimination remaining displayed upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes shout, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! True!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This last many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which first his guardians observed, that several times during the day he would count upon his fingers a desinite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his friends entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going exceedingly to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad on the mark of returning influence, of which they feared he had been deprived, they merited the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Arnold seemed pensive, and startled them all more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered no, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently aware of being under the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more open to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his learned warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance-\nWhen she addressed her future husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and ganging on her with a frantic expression of intimacy, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man again. But he could not advance–it seemed as if someone had raised his voice. Again. He made him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In this meant that the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his custody, enjoined, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to do him good one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had come the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Avrey's ill health, he regarded himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attentions, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and utmost in his fate, he successfully won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangors and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–but could also bow, since he knew her, his existence, had beguiled to seem worthy of presorvation, if it were inerely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of state, that he gained her affections. The fortunes of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an occasion for hastening their marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nHenry, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the bope of their happiness, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy circumstances. The serjeant promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hooke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost fainting. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartmen's where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately opposed, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. He was on the staircase, Lower. Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is ruined.\" Women are frail!\" So soothing, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had spilled a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not communicated to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and groom lost London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly whal the reader then perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MIT.\nLONDON.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to find his place of rest, and Provider his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of the same name. The bounties of this place, and the constant supply of oattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchandisers; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships coming to Smyrna, its bounties amply reward for the deviation of a voyage. We resided, as usual, at the bottom of the boy, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser collecting for cattle with the natives, the clergy.\nMan and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, which we had not seen before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English regiment, which left the island on a particularly sour day, prior to our arrival in the city. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to go to Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Domick, the wine-trader, six shillings for it (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to different islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in haftening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—on crescent-hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tabernacles on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to flow through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane choirs, and an empty book-case: there wore no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a single mattress across on the floar, with two stuf-\nTwo cotton quilts and a pillow–the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seamari's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Paris; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Moses; Kotzebue's nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Corinthian, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notices, sometimes with a pencilled in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was lovingly scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been counting these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until he returns; for he is so particular, that were I to move one book without counting, he would frighten up me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the property of this farm without the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty-five shillings which I pay to an aged Armonian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the first brought here from Adrlanople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and four hundred feet wide, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths on fret-work cornices, (as it is customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the others. The roof, surrounded by a heavy stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong corrugated linen. Most of the house-lops are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"clercyma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small breeze glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two largemouth bushes, a marble table with an ornamental woodenback was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, roading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A smouldering smoke issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountaineer's base. The sky is clear as glass, and an island unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, surrounded by a canopy of lofty chirchnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic soliloude: none knew his name but Domick, his banker, who had been close to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will forget,\"—\"And cannot you, old friend?\" He replied, \"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return from the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had accompanied eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and remained with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new hoat for a fisherman who had lost his boat in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament's to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have had a very eccentrie and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and given her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we decamped from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who the rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Felling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, proprietor of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mityleno.\" We had never then heard of his lord's name, as we had been some years from home; but \"Caldwell Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in that page. Deeply did we regret not having been more diligent in our researches at the cottage, but we resolved ourselves to the object of returning to Marylebone on some future day. To me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which he has been grossly slandered. He has been described as having an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, and incapable in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The case is directly the result, as may be plainly gathered from these little illustrations. All the noble feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and affection charitably appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for inclosing him as a being on whose head Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Violence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed towards man's moral integrity; and ho who dares to defend himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in society, and receive the whole world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "17": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a human body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautified. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatten up, and their insides became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, dated March, 1732, is a curious, account, of course, credibulous of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hovngary. It appears, that upon an examination of the coroner-chlef and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This punishment, however, did not prevent him from coming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a testimonial was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nostrils, and ears, pure and florid breath. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and soul of Arnold Paul, at which point he is dead.\nHe seemed to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe common belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tummy.\nChief bailiff.\nThe monotonous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instalments which could be adduced. In any part of Greece. It is considered as a rule of punishmen after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirm his infernal visits only to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A proposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut here on earth, as Vampyre sent, your corse shall from its tomb be rent; It will ghastly have the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet from the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, when they see it expiro, shall cry out in grief for their sire; As cursing him, thou cursing them, The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a fat boy's name– The ward shall wrap you in flame! Yet thou must end this task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glimmer which must view which freezes over its lifeless form; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the remainder of her long hair, of which, in life a lock which shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Majesty of thine agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, till the people in the mirror shrink away from spectre more infamous than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Tbalaba,\" the melancholy character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in his absence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful nature of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracruz Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, which includes a variety of accounts, and traditionary reflections stimulating its effects, has produced for some learned dissertations, ten\nDealing to prove it was a classical, as well as barbarian orror.\nMany curious and interesting details on this singularly horrible superstition must be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a description, necessarily confined to observation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one first general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucke, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the inhabitants of the ton a man, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as though he could not participate in it. Apparently, the light lavender of the flower only attracted his attention, that he might by a lash quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not cease to constrate, and at one glance seemed to pierce through to the inward workings of the body; it fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin so that it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the stirring emolion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the femalo hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some measure of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did almost put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his attention:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparent fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappeasable impudence was rebuffed, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence him even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was inferior to him; yet such was the apparent contempt with which he addressed to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domicstic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAt the same time, he came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortitude, while they relieved the more importanl charge of his mind to the care of regimentary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and honour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He expected all to sympathise with him, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the genre, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of the cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye with their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the droams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and ruffian: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with envy their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same lime, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tollow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing picturcs and desiptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, but the tacit indifference to their existence, produced by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forged this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon him upon notice, that his presence was always recalled. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and so he found, from the notes of preparation, in High Street, where he was about to travel. Deceased of gaining some information respecting this sirigular character, who, till now, had only only aroused his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves up to an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever certain invasions are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They communicated, and Aubrey immediately mentoring his intentions to Lord Russell, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many of his actions were exposed to his view, the evidence offered different conclusions from the apparent motives behind his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were given from time to time with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent home with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater portability of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charley of his Lordship, which was still very much impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, far more than they either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the moft a pit of impurity. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent indifference with which his companion sovght for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the far-flung: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known culprit was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, when he encounted the rash youthful indiscretion, or the luckless father of a nuinerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune in law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aslde, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the most merrily affluent youth, from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the tone of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him wit the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last sovereign he had just snatched from the convulsing grasp of the innocent: his might but was the result of an uncertain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable as combating the might of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in the carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater satisfaction from it than the constant excitement of vainly striving to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning prayer of an Imperial countess, whilst he went in search of the memoranda of another almost ruined city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager excitement; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astounded him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians urged upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicariously, for that the possession of irresistable power of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the prosecutrix had not originated in any weakness of her character; but that he had required, to ennoble himself with gratuitousation that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all those persons whom he had wished, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask of innocence, and had not scrupled to exposit the whole extent of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a slagging point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some private pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he so frequently frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefor obliged to carry on his business in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him on all his windings, and soon discovered that an appointment had been oppointed, which would likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intents with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of him being expected to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avrey retorted; and, immediately writing a note to say, that from that moment he must refrain from accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered the fervent to seek other apartments, and calling upon the other of the ladies, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete agreement to a separation; but did not hint any suspence of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubry directed his steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed up residence in the house of a Greek; and commenced himself in tracing the faded records of ancien glory upon manuments that apparently, instead of chronicling the deeds of noblemen only against slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as herself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to put vividly on canvass the promised hope of the failed in Mahomet's paradisc, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had lost their souls. As she danced upon the pavement, or tripped upon the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beouties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the cliched suit, to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of the often excited Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconseious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it went upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who often forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an alm effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately bordered and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object ho had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can articulate?–It was inriocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those memories of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penknife, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would describe to him the circling dunes on the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the sensational tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief in what she narrated, excited the utmost interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest friends, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the remaining months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idyllic and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last discovered one living among them, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the starnp of the creature's appetitc; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, marked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had same proof given, which induced them, with grief and heartbreak, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance.\nHis fear of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernaturality of Lord Routhven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had set for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculated the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the exotic fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he often found it impossible to direct his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was absolutely sure of her love, and was ever the same frank infante being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was be because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some mystery wbich had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyref, and they had, with severance present, affirmed their existence, proceeding with forbearance at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, and which door had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon those who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them fainter at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with contempt. As he was about to depart, the woman came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, saying that night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action, as promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spurned for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is entirely unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunder had ceased an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forks of lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly the horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approched, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, all but allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugher, continued in an almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, in a sudden efforl, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though called, the founds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately dismissed, when a voice cried, \"Accidental death!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was no use: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the wall:–his assailant threw himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the window that gaped open in the day, dislurbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the streams, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the lashing of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy fakes of silk. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, streaked by his tears. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even on her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed as attaining as the life that dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously their eyes slunk with horror, \"AMPyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had so long been to him the object of so many right and fairy vision, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to sink into reflection, and he took refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular design, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had communicated. Their lamentable cries, as they reached the city, foretold the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their feelings would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervents he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccountable coinage he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and she would regard him as her destroyer. Lord Routhven, chanced at this time to arrive in Athens, and, from what over motive, upon hearing of the statement of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constable. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image ho had now combined with that of Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, implying almighty repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and still more by the apprehension, anxiety, and care which he showed, reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was compelled to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, and a smile of malicious exultation passing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the present stage of the prisoner's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless wights raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of a man.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it near the ruins he had formerly frequented, Iantho's form stood in his way; but when he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modernet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smirk upon her lips. He determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him close by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those ports of Greece that he had yet seen. They ranged in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but when they travelled from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbery, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were on the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretences of dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the security of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow depression, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence, for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the sudden firing of bullets close to their heads, and by the ceaseless report of several more. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and threatening to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in pursuit of the enemy. Hardly had they reached the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hasten to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces array him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Auhrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence than they were, being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortality ensued, and death seemed advancing in slow steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as insensible of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the meeting, his mind became apparently unbalanced, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than his usual gentleness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour.\nIn your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I cannot explain the whole; but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your very fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAvrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances surrounding his close acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the pretences of some terrible horribleness awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon retiring, to the pen of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that he should be exposed to the harsh cold ray of the morning which rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothe, although the robbers swore they pointed to the dental rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retried, convinced that they had buried the body for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of the country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently seemed to heighten that superslient melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing seueral weapons of once, more or less employed to ensure the death of the victim. There were scveral daggers and ataghons. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon on, and his horror could not be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; the particular form, the same varying marks upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's heart became almost broken under so intense horror; he was afraid that the lady had made a mistake in the handling of the purse. He was morose and filent; and his only occupation was in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hasened to the mansion as his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the embraces and cares of his sister, all memory of the past. If she besore, by her infantine caresses, had strengthened his affection, when that the woman began to appear, he was still more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her left eye was never let up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholic charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling of melancholy, that appeared to indicate a soul coruscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which stroys where a butterfly or a crow may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alive, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and would in her presence forget his troubles. She know destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if the eye's were then playing in the light of the world's own new sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, when he might be her pratector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the new drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the \"busy scene.\" He would rather have remained in the employ of his fathers, and fed on the inelancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable dressers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own freedom to the protections of his sister. They then arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–the drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened there. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of those around him, engorged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very spot—he was suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly gone to turn, fearful of seeing what would frighten him, when he perceived, at a slight distance, the same flure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was compelled to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumferences started up in a curious array–the dagger–his oath–He repeated himself, he could not believe it possible–the devil would rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, however, to bring it into society; for though he endeavoured to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the name hung up from his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried steps, forced her towards the street: at the door he found her impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached her.\nAubrey became immediately distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the menace of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now voraciously, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slurred him; was he then to allow this morister to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disolose his statements, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such wickedness; but this, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and was only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer able of bearing sorrows and solitudo, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at once he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to watch him; but they were soon driven away by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Stricken with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicioned looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from drinking, for her sake, a society which affronted her.\n-ected him so disgracefully. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to reconsider, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume a gain of trust which had been hefore imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one particular subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severe lyaffed her, he would urge her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not hurt him–if your love for me is cloying, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! True!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his appearances came less frequent, and his mind lost a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his prisoner upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aury's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glod of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, he merited the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pained, and astonished still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered him, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparent quite capable of being affected by the lure of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being ever more alive to the feelings of attachment. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly received a knock upon her breast, and opening it, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the monster who had so greatly influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it with his foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a French expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would not be wed to this man, for he– But be could not advance–it seemed as though she again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and for-\nCiting him from Miss Aubrey, compelled her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he impored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been resused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed fit insincere, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and through their great affection for the other and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Wha could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tolls to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any one on the crowded earth, save with the person to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing calls;–in fine, he knew so well how to use his serpents's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the prisoner and his guardians, attempted to rob the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now on the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the man's curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy irates of the house; and Aubrey heard, will a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of some terrible preparation. Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Rutbven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if you ride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Womori are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendances, who, informed by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his roge, finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approaching of death. He feared his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe Germans hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Russell had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirft of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LLOYD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all about him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1882, we came into the harbour of Malinc, in tho island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattlo and vegetables alway to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it–both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track of ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, after some difficulty, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in washing, and the women bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble round the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been previously. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malta, where I am likely.\" They get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not consistently; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our excitement very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over them. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entry hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room with a spacious cloak-room annexed. They were all simply decorated: groen-stained walls, marble tuffles on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a sprig fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty baok-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bedchamber had morely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large man's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not consider ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rochefort's works complete; Volney's Revolutions; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1881; several small pamphlets from the Gricek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie upon his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with his orders, he would throw me for a week together; he is other things very goaded.\" I once did him a favour; and I have the property of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was forty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pliriths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grocian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a small Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachrymna christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, rapes, ranges and lime were clumping together on the borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed most of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was well-dressed, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Montcalm, covered with oak and myrtle tree's in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream running from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woads near the mill.\nWitness's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terrinates the vicarage in front; and a little on the left, through a thicket of white chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue water with spots of emerald groen. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, the banker, who had called here. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return from the mission we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had possessed eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial occasions. He gave a woollen to one man, brooches to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learn, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nThis was the question with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, conjecturing who this rambler in Greeley could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthrophy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark aculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dissipated. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architeet, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byran; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcutta in this page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future date; but to know that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it to be quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, and incapable in any way to relieve its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdoles. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his lordship's pooms, ought to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatry, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an odditional reason for marking him as a being on whose head Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lrails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his questions or pleas, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against a man's moral integrity; and he who dares to submit himself to that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving science.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prunter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "18": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears most common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Grecks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form for the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjod in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beavers. In the West it occurred, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a poison.\nA portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of emphysema; whilst these human blood-viscers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of the body, and from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular occurrence of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hesse. It appeared, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and other gistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years ago, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had borne to say, that at Caſsovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the dead out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the advertised remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This being done, they cut off his head, buried his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The following measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, that they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre resembles a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief judge.\nThis remarkable correspondence is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the principal observations than any other evidence which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment beyond death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth–the same to whom he was bourid by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse must from it's death be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at mid-day from the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, The victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; A' cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withcred on the stem. But on whom forthy crime must fall, The youngest, best known of all, shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap your heart in shame! When thou must end thy task and mark her cheok's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must flash which freezes her lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in one lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with your own best blood still drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Then stalking from thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of remarrying him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her wife, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracruz Tremort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishingly cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calhoun, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradtionary illustrations illustrative of its effects, he put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this particularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, highly devoted to explanation, and which may now be conclusively dismissed by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in different parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant on a London winter, there appeared at the mostrious parlours of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his services, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts whose boughtlessness disturbed him. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributing it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the defendant's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin and could not pass. His pecuniary habits caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had not been accustomed to vivacious excitement, and who bore the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the dejected hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were brutal, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms during her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were opparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–evidently her urcuated impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the criminal adultress could not influence ever the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that he knew he addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his florid relatives, or that they were moved by his father's reputation of vice, he was as often among those females who form the base of their fortune from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, he came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan, left with an only sister in the possesion of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary soldiers, he cultuated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high moral feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many men's appreritices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the sting of clothes, which were not warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by the irrogular folds on various coloured patches. He bought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the necessities of life. He was handsome, fronk, and rich: for these reasons, and his entering into the gay cliques, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describc with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daugters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his value and importance. Attached as he was to the regiment of his daily hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tobacco and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffling, there was no disturbance in real life for any of the hundreds of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in the volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, same compunction in his gratisied verdict, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the unfortunate being we have already described, crossed him in the corridor.\nHe dismissed him; described the very impossibility of grasping an idea of the cruelty of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence.\nlied by the voidance of their circumstances: allowing his imagination to picture a very life that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and compelled to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining some information respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the task, which for far many generations has been necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pique, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey intimating his intentions to Lord Richmond, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such mark of esteem shown him, who, apparently, had no comradeship with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubry had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's correspondence, and now he found, that, although many more of his acts were exposed to his view, the results offered different concusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His comportment was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to meet their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his alms; these were sent through the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask meeting, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink himself still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich company. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicar.\n-ious, which gonerally prevails over the retiring grace of the virtuous indomitable. There was one circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was far more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffing, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the appearance eagerness with which his companions sought the centres of a sashionable vice; there he entered in all the spirit of the faro table: be betted, and be garnished with success, except where the known sharper was his adversary, and he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he had long watched the society entertained. He was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novico, or the luckless father of an numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this unfortunate abomination of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than those of the cat while dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the moderately affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drown him with the roach of this fiend; where once a father sat joyfully, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his considerable wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of anything, the last giver he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of kriewledge, which was not, however, as formidable as combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to sign that charity and measure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own interests; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and honestly to him; but, thankfully, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his passion, he obtained no greater gratisication from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imaginations began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; but be kept him in daily attendance upon the morning prayer circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the monuments of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, lettors arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astounded him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power referent in his conduct, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and recommended, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that he possession of irascible habits of seduction, rendered his licentious habit more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his lust, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females who he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole nature of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He progressed into the same circle, and so perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his affairs in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, but thougthless girl. Lasing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, intimating at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were as he supposed a man would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended murder.\nHe refused to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wriling a mind, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the pursuit of their proposed marriage, he ordered his servant to seek other premises, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevenled. Lord Ruthven on that day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a sepclaration; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Avbrey's interposition.\nHaving left Romance, Aubrey directed his steps low toward Greece, and crossed there.\nHe left the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He took up his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the forged records of ancient glory up from monasteries that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had bidden themselves hidden beneath the sheltering soil or many cooured licheries. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, but that her eyes spoke too much for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plajn, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have though the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often assisted Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engclosed in the pursuance of a Kashmere bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgave the lettuces he had just decamped upon an almost effaced trunk, in the contemplation of her splendid figure. Often would her locks falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swift sading hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had formerly thought of vital importarice to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe arms which all fancy, but none can appreclate?–It was innacence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. When he drew upon the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his beloved wife, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenography of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dunes upon the open plain, would paint, to him in a most beautiful manner, the marriage procession she remembered viewing in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural habits of her nurse. His earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exclosed the interest even of Arnold; and often as she told him the tale of the lascivious vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friend's, and doarest friends, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his enjoyment for the ensuing month, his blood would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the names of old men who had at once detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional occurrence of such monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty occurrence of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of L. R. Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affeated virtuosity of the women among whom he had saught his senses of romance, won his heart; and when he ridiculated the idea of a young man of English hobits, inarrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself morose and indifferent to the almost fairy form besotted him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-vampire research, he would depart, determined not to return till his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his gaze upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image which seemed alone the most perfect possessor of his object. She was unconscionable of his love, and was ever the most frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to distance herself from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, as confirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when he heard the name of the place, he at once begged of him not to return al night, as he must neccessarily pass through a wood, where no one would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. He described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of the reprisals, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, eternal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night alowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put into effect; he promised. He was, however, so excited in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the horizon there was an appearance of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so frequently gather together to a tremendaus mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these out-of-doors, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was upon him–its exploding thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick hoavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismissing, he apprached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the starm. As he approached, the thunders, for some mysterious reason, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant moekery of a laugh, continuing in an almost brokering sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; and, though he struggled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in eontact with someone, whom he immediately recognized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands on his throat–when the glare of any number of flashes penetrating through the hole that had been made in the door, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door; and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as they broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Avrey they searched for her wha had attracted him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness, but what was his horror, when the light of the torchbeast once more burst upon him, to perceive the alry form of his fair conductress lying in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his prodigious imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that dwelt there: upon her neck and chest there was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her, who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now follen with the father of her life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was blank and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he beld almost unconscionably in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her where the woman had disappeared. The lamentable cries, as they approached the house, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubroy, and rushed to the corse. They were inconsolable; many died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wit a most violent fever, and was almost delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and Sir Ianthe; by some accountable combination he seemed to beg of his former employer to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malcdictions upon his head, and ourfe him as her murderer. Lloyd Ruthven, chanoed at the same time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever influence, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his immediate attendent. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and distressed at the sight of him whose image he had compared with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the apprehension, anxiety, and distress which he showed, so reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic man who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again degenerated into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation pllying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Dividing the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooing breeze, and in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, over the world, the moveless sands;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguised him now serenely fled for ever. He was now as much a fan of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Abington; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly soused, Clerkenwell's form stood by his side; if be sought it in, the woods, her long step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; her head, suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He used to fly scenes, the fealure of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Routh, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travellod in every direction, and fought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually came to slight these reports, which they imagined were largely the invention of individuals, whose object was to excile the generality of those whom they defenseless.\nDefended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus negating the advice of the jubilaries, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock hrought down from the neighbouring precipices, they were compelled to repented their negligence; for scarcely were the members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of locusts close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several gurgles. In an instant the guards had left them, and, placing themselves between rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being temporarily detained by a foe, who with insulling shouts bade them advice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in pursuit of their enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a blow in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately drawn up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great remonstrance, Avrey soon induced him to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their employer should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death commenced advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last engagement, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me –you may do more than that –I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Avrey. \"I need but little. Life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the why–but if you would certify all you know of me, my life were free from stain in the world's mouth–and my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but now I know.\" \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him fist with exultant violerice, \"Swear! - What all your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for one year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deeds to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you might see. His eyes seemed burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to his room, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presurrence of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the house in which he had left the corpse, when a robber entered him, and informed him that there was no prisoner there, having been confined by him some hours before his retiring, to the house of a neighbour on a neighbouring mount.\nAccording to a promise they had made in marriage, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking counsel of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had come to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, but the neighbors swore they pointed out the identicolous rock on which they had laid it. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjuncture, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the body for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a county in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which events apparently conspired to bring him into that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he assisted himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing various weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the accused. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst watching them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to go for further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, although peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet till he wished to disbolieve; but the peculiar form, the same varying lints upon the shaft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on the blade.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his friends were conversing the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductress. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's heart was first broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only expression remained in increasing the speed of the postiles, as if he were going to savor the loss of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by her infatuation with him, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assembly. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the love of the mother bone. There was a melon.\nThere was a charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling something, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colossus may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brained by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence bear those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuousry? It seemed as if all those eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her friends more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, which he must be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of his introduction into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so tormented by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessivo–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to be in the company of royalty, crowded forth. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a crowd by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognised too well, whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had scarcely begun to turn, fearful of seeing a pistol that would blast him, when he perceived, from a little distance, the mysterious figure which had attracted his notice on this spot on his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands on his hips, as if he were afraid his thoughts were breaking from his brain. Lord Ruthven came to see him–circumstances started up in a dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused him, he could not believe it possible.\nHe thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impassible that it could be real–he determined, the previous, to go again into society; but when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining admission. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a malarkey, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own de vauring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he endeavoured to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the passage; but on the way he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he suddenly heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurriedly following his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became most distracted. Before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the man's living death had pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in this state that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath swore by him; was he then to allow this morister to roclm, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not stop its progress? Her very sister must have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but such, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besoughed him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, often exposed to the noon sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he should be haunted by his enemies the whole of his life, with a fiend amongst them, in whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his enemies, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at once obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for her sake, a fociety which affited him so deeply. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the comrades thought it proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allenated, they thought it high time to reconsider again that punishment which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily inflicted in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they induced a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbered by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his bed.\nBye Bye. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become congested, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and affection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, grasping her hands, with looks that severally afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is avaght, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherence became less frequent, and his mood threw off a portion of its gloom, when his guard noticed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then stop.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, on account of his guardian entering his room, began to communicate with his physician about the maloholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was getting ready to be married. Instantly Avrey's attention was attracted; he exclaimed anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they seared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsdon. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had acquainted with in society, Aubrey sent pleas, and improved them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the infence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to comfort her about her marriage with a person so diabolic for rank and every accomplice; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and going down on her with a frantic expression of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not agree–it seemed as if that voice had bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven was near him but found no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relight of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them not to delay but one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the inquest after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his expression of pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the prisoner and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any one in the crowded earlh, save with her to whom he addressed friends; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accentions; in either case, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubry, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, comforting her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that inarriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to barass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be perceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overeame their vigil, and they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opera-room, where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by foree, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lard Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the neclaach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was for him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of oattle and vegetables scarcely to be had here, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties easily repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been boating. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Groek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in Florence. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to go to Mitylene, where I am like to be married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, a wine-trader, six shillings for it, (60l. L250 Irish currency,) and has resided there about four months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansions. It consisted of four compartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, marble tables on either side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play out the brims by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning post; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty box-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed-maker had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two well-frogged cotton quilts and a pjow—the cornmon bedstead of Greeff. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Mesfiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; some small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much lorn, but no English work of any consequence. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Italiari and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without order, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did have a servant; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Constantinople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkoy carpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-lops are thus surnished, as upon which the Greoks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christian,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the other hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapevines, aranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtles, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" far he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Carmel, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Groek temple appeored in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little way on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnats and palm-trees, several small islands were discernibly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic location: I did know his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"would tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armonland, but on our return to the town we learnt more.\nThe particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a galley, and he often gave Greek Testament to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we observed, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her well the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceable Isle of Messina; our imagination's all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"of whom you are most anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had not ever then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been on some journeys away; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more careful in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc on some other day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement.\nWitness, believing it to be quite unnecessary, and in justice to his Majesty's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charitably affection seem to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is on additional remand for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Violence hath brown her mantle. No man can follow the preceding respectable \"traits\" without feeling proud of himself as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be taken with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral irresponsibility; and he who dares submit himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a felow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and receive the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving intellect.\nTHE END.\nGilllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "19": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Powell\nTHE circumstance upon which this tale is founded is vory general in the East. For the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend its reach to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually incased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the living and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variatiori, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain quantity of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their flesh became so saturated to the point of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of the skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the committee-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a clergyman Hiscock, named Arnold Paul, had been ho to say that, at Cassini, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with its blood. This prevention, however, did not prevent him from becoming avamparre himelf; for, about twenty or twenty-three days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been assaulted by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of murder) fully formed, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blossom. .Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as drearily as if he had been drowned. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, be agents upon those who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his victims.\nChief bailiff.\nThis remarkable circumstance is here related, because it seems more adapted to illustrate the gravity of the present observations than any other circumstance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftor death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not allowed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his irreligious visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, a Vampyre sent. Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood from all thy ranks; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, and children drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must flow from thy living corse, Thy victims, whose lives yet expire, shall know the demon for their sins; As currying thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withored on the stem. But one that for thy crime must not fall, The youngest, best behaved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart round! Then thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glaze must view Whither she sways on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall trace the trescles of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with your own best blood still drip; Thy gnashing loath, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy wretched grave, Go, and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sime was also introduced in the wild but beautiful guise of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre cousin of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She was never loved whilst in existence. But this crime seemed to have resulted from the sinful habits of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournant gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, comprising a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrative highly substantiated of effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present will suffice for the effect of a note, previously devoted to explication, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre if the one in most general acceptation, there are several others similar to it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocba, Vardouocha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the parties a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed up at the millers around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to pulse, and did not one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence and excilement, and now felt the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In view of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its form and out-look were beautiful, many of the female hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the companion of every minister shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in question when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were unperceived;–cven her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence him from the guiness of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: such was the apparent conduct with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as much among those females who could form the boast of such scruples from their domestic habits, as among those who swore it by their vicars.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan with an only sister in the possession of great wealth.\nBy parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Lest also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important matters of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he entertained more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that most romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily filled so many railway' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown about by Providence merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of pets were the realities of life. He was good-looking, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with all truth their languishing or romping favourite daughters: the daughters at the same time, by their brighlening appearances when he approached, and their penetrating eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led them into false notions of his talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax caridles that flickered, from the presence of a ghost, or from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasurable pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his domains, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed no other signs of his obscenity of extemal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of conflict: allowing his consciousness to picture every thing that flaunted its propensity for extrovagant ideas, he so formed this object as the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, more than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was almost recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Bow-street, that he was aboul to treason. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had ony whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of violets towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, when such candalous intrigues are mentioned af the pretexts of pleasantry or of prudence, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately merging his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flooded by a mark of recognition from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few minutes they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of meeting Lord Ruthven.\nHe knew his character, and now he found, that, when many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different concusions for the apparencies to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indignity by the misfortuncs attending even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were scouted from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in lust, or to sink him further in his iriquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunality of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, however, found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost more than he gained; but he was constantly with the same uncharitable face, with which he generally watched the society about him: it was not, however, so when he accompanied the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fatber of a large family; then his very wish seemed for fortune's law—this abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with the half-dead mouse. In very town, he left the formerly affluent youth, and from the oakle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him with them into the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late inheritance, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had first snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the robbers experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking freely and only to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circuit of an Italian castle, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another most deserted city. Whilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he read with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his friends, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his companion was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rend him with licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to cance his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vendor, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their vices, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposit the whole deformity of they vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest her eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purchasing, in the mean while, to watch him more closoly, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubry's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, but thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very evening. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed.\nHe asked why she would look upon such an officer; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remonstrance of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other instructions, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven had that day merely sent his serjeant to notify him of his complete assent to separation; he did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's jealousy.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed himself towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsular, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and occupied himself in tracing the faded records of antiquity upon moraines that apparently, as a result of concentrating the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of being faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spake too much nonsense for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountaintop's side, one would have thought the gait a peculiar type of her beautios; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious eye of the animal? But to the tasto of an epicure. The light of day often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscious girl, engagod in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letter's he had decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray a delicately briliant and swiftly fading appearance, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all see, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, you see, and beavty, affected by crowded drawing-rooms and attending balls. Whilst he drew the pictures of which he wished to preserve a memoranda for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic efflections of his penknife, in tracing the streets of her native place; she would then describe to him the curious dance upon the open plain, would paint to him in all the glowing colours of youthful excitement, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infoncy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparencence of what she narrated, exited the interest even of Aubrey; and often when she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had populated years among his friends, and whose ties, forced every year, by foeding upon the life of a recently female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whil he attempted to keep her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at once deceased one living person themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the marks of the creature's affliction; and when she found him so irreducible, she begged of him to believe her, for he had been, remarked, observed, that those who had dared to question their accusation, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coinoidences which had all tended to expiate of belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutherven.\nAsrey began to attach himself more and more to the girl, her beauty, so contorted with all the asfected virtues of the women whom he had sent for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man out of English habits, marrying an uneducated German girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would learn himself at times from her, and, saving a portion for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image of himself alone as the rightful possessor of his treasures. He was uncanscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and honest being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was hecause she had no other close one with whom she could vivit her favourite baunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelling or uncovering some frogment which had escaped the deftness of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, and they both, with severance present, affirmed their belief, but with horror at the very name. Shortly after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration.\nOn. They described it as the return of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evasions as impinging upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh himself out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his journey unattended; he was surprised to behold the meloncholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. Whon he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, before he allowed the power of these beings to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come to an end, and on the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at once, howevr, mounted his horse, determined to make up some speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climes, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fountains seemed to flow and ripple at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful reluctance through the entangled forest. The animal at once, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to provide shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the furious shrioks of a woofer, mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugher, continued in one loud, unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rumbled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in conflict with someone, whom he immediate seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his assailant threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up to his throat–when the glare of any torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was raging still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the fire loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had accompanied him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was he to do, when the light of the lantern once more came upon him, to perceive the curious form of the fair conductress brought in a lifeline. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he uncloshed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men replied, erring, somewhat struck with horror, \"A shot!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her, who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was fatigued and seemed to be in reslection, and he took refuge in vacuums–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a others had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the public of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the causality of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and patted him on the chest. They were consolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these circumstances he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Lord Horsley–by some unocountable occurrence he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecise maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, called at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediate placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the prisoner recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starstruck at the sight of him whose image he had now associated with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, indicating almost repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His demeanor seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so upset Aubrey; but as soon as his consciousness began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no distinction from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of monumental exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Routhven was apparently engaged either in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breezes, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this blow, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled him for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the rivins he had formerly frequenled, Anthea's form stood by his side; if be sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in company of the modest violets; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every detail of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tendor care be had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a ballot could be conveyed: but as they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually learned to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invontion of indivisible men, whose interest it was to excite the generality of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guiders than as a defence. Protesting, however, upon reaching a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brooding down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their error; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several shots. In an instant the guards had removed them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to search in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubry, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltorig turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus degraded by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting soldiers, if any of the robbers should come near and attack them from the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the hold of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground grateful. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer beeding the contretemps or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven being wounded, immediate thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to carry his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till his comrade should return with the promised sum, far which he had an account. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed dancing with basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaffected of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the call of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need not much–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–or if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rousing himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my curses or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or what you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his knees, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the various circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do. When he resumed his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrid awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when the robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pirinacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. Bt, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they had picked out the identically rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently seemed to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to convey him to Ortranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effibles he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthver. Amongst other things there was a chest containing several weapons of execution, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath appurtenantly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he exclaimed–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the fame varying colours upon the blade and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and there was no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, to Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivc arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this country had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silenseless; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shares; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more alluring as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning character which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the proceedings. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes, but from some seeling within, that appeared to indicate a being conscious of a darker realm. His step was not that light footing, which strays where a butlerfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smelt of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would not let her forget the griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native spectacles. She was yet eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guards more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her prime minister. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel sorry about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced in a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessing–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath.\" He had hardy refused to look, fear of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed until his legs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried stops, and kept his hands up over his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances presented up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He repeated himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise aggan!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be recovered; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask counting Lothbury, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a room, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him their faces. He was abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, led her tawards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey came almost distanced. If before his mind had been absorbed by one project, how much more compulsive was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the morister's making a gain pressed upon him? His sister's attentions were now unheedable, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The sooner he thought, the more he was saved. His oath startled him; was he to allow this monster to roam, wreaking ruin upon his house, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but duty, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in the room, he saw no one, and cried only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of enjoying freedom and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnights damps. He was no longer recognized; at first he returned with the knife to cut him; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for her safety, emulated people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the melancholy that had left by his absence the company of his friends, with a fiend stalking them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watched him closely, anxious to learn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affixed him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the Germans considered it proper to intrpose, and, fearing that Biron's mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and suffering he had daily inflicted in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiologist to remain in the house, and take careful care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by some terrible subjeuet. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy luster; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would beg her not to tauch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a slate, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months; gradually, however, as the year was passing, his appearances became less frequent, and his mind took off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his singers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a fituation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked witness to whom. Glad of his mark of returning affection, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irruption of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and honorable achievement; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced him. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus betrayed the fidelity of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his face, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but seeing no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retraction of the order, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to give him up. He fell upon his knees to her, he implored, he begged of her to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had refused with every one in attendance. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood him to be the cause of it; but when he be learnd that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by cousin attendance, and through expression of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his passion? His long life had been pains to count; could speak of himself as of an unholy creature having no sympathy witb any being on the crowded street, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accentions; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or whatever was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother belonging at length to him, he obtained an important embalming, which served as an excuse for forbidding the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was accompanied by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the fervents, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servant promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he though it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, whom he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aury heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of breaking preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless young woman. He seized the opportunity, while one of them was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were quietly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister has dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage, in finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptomatic of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related composedly what the reader has perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey-foster had shown the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LDR. BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, but he had to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Gregoian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Milylcne in the island of that name. The bounties of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British visitors to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and himself took a ram down to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain monticule so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, whole of the land four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his fclucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoroted: plain green-slained walls, marble labels on other sides, a large myrtle in the centre, and a large fountain outside, which could be made to play through the rooms by moving a spring fixed in the shape of a small brorize Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa supported the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single pajamaing. The bedstead had merely a large rectangle spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a paillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which was then joined with a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet in the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokoff's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmern, in the German language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlet from the Greek press al Constantinople, much to read, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with morginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remitted.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading some books the evening before he soiled, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"that they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to do anything without orders, he would frown upon us for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the whole of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an old Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleading. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars wth black plinths and sret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were almost as high as the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we approached the house, a small streamlet glided along, grapes, aranges and limes were clustering together on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamented wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the defendant spent many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, and writing to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, cered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, till it was last seen in the woods near the murderer's base. The sea is smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a fingernail-edge, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of largely chesnut and palm-trecs, several small islands were distinctly served, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald groen. I seldom enjoyed a job more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resited in this romantic position: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had given money to Candia. \"The Armerian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare riot.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned some particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and entertained them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who made by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had loft his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friends at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her to use it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece was. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Founding in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my chambers on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it to be quite honorable, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with any human race, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The face is directly the reverse, and may be gleaned from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and courting the repose of solitude is an additional reward for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" that will speak highly of him as a countryman. With respect to his debts or pleases, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reporters are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral irresponsibility; and he who dares justfy himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a foul-mortal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and an impartial conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-court, Fleel-street.",
    "20": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually inereased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extenuating, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blooms of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain quantity of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a point of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credibulous account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appeared, that upon an exclamation of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they posited positively and unequivocally affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovja, on the frontiers of the Turkish Serjeantia, he had been tortured by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This caution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, several persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the inouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been shot. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyriſm, lest they should, in their tum, become agents upon other who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sueked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThe moristrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of these prefent observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece death is considered as a punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only forbidden to remarry, but compelled to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindrod and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nFirst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, though they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thieving them, thy flowers are withered on the stalk. But one that for thy sake must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with his father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flames! Yet thou must end thy life and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which side of its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand must tear the tresfes of her hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affectian's fondest pledge was worn– But now is blown away by the Memoranda of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror sink down from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also alluded in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneida, who is represenled as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exile. But they cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of some astonishing case of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have borne an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a richness of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barborian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this particularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarly devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one most general acceptation, there are many others likewise synonymous with it, and in use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations inflicted upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the party a nobleman, more remarkable for his slangsularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair maiden attracted his attention, that he might by a chance quell it, and throw foam into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain whence it arose: same attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, or at least not pierce through to the inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all went to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their midst capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the dead-green hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the straining emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female huntors after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountaineer, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed that they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But when the criminal adultress could not influence even the guiness of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparerit caution with which he spoke to the prosecutrix wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongve; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were mollified by his apparent hubris ofvice, he was often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as opposed to those who sully it by their vicissitudes.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with an only sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guards, who thought their duty merly lotake care of his fortune, when they relinquished the more important charge of his maintenance to the core of military subalterns, he cultivated more of his imagination than his judgment. He had, therefore, that high romantic feeling of honour and condour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown into Providence merely for the picturesque effect on the seene, as we fee in romances: he supposed that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye with their irregular folds and voluminous coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the necessities of life. He was handsome, smart, and charming: for those reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, in any mother surrounded him, striving which should describe with East truth their languishing and unsatisfying favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brighing couritenances whom he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, so led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no room in real life for any of that congeries of pleasurable piotures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some comfort in his gratified vanity, he was almost ready to relish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have just described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: commanding his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensily to fanciful ideas, he soon formed the object into the form of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon him without notice, that his prescence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only shown his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice toward putting themselves up an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as the fallen of the skillets, whose scandalous intrigues are described as the subjects of plunder or of praise, according to the degree of skill shown in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to marry him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circumnavigating waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to meet their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not help remarking, that it was not upon the unfortunate, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant upon him, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressing sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wonts, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generically prails over the retiring habits of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the West and the East in abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashion and vice; there he entered into the spirit of the law: he betted, and always gambled with success, excepl where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed contrary to the law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-decended mouse. In every town, he saw the formerly educated youth, torn from the circle he adjoined, cursing, in the soliloquy of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him near to the reach of his fiend; whilst his father sat frantic, amidst the speaking lookings of mute hungry children, without a single fling of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. He took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsively grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of ousting the cunning of the more experienced. Aurey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resolutely renounce that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own position; but he refused it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven, in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the coristant excitement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companions; he left them in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he read with great impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon immediately laving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his lascivious habits more dangerous in society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had desired, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urbane virtue, down the lowesl abyss of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all the femalef whom he had sougbt, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whale deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey delivered up four, leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a serious bright point on which to strike the eye. He resolved to offer some plausible reason for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and so perceived, that his Lordship was still endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with respect in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his pursuits in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an investigation had been appointed, which would most likely result in the ruin of an innocent, though pretty girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very evening. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed wether he intended to marry her, merrily laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in theremainder of the proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the conduct of his Lordship. The assignatiori was proved.\nMONDAY. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his fervent to notify his complete assent to a sepclaration; but did not hint at a subscription.\npicion of his plans having been foiled by Auhrey's intervention.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsular, soon found himself at Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon immersed himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon antiquities thot apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden them beneath the sheltering soil or marry coloured licheries. Under the same circumstances as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a pointer wishing to pour tray upon tray the prornished hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no hopes. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mounain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type in her habits; for who would have exchanged her eye, apperently the eye of animated naturo, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Avrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the uncorruptious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagle gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just read upon an almighty effaced tablet, in the constriction of her sylph-like figure. If her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliancy and swiftly fading hues, might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a possage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, you see, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew the remains of which he wished to preserve as memorial for his future hours, she would pass by, and watch the miraculous effects of his penance, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plinth, which she would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youth and memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supematural tales of her nurse. Her honesty, and apparent belief of what she narrated, entertained the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the intervening months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of some idyll and horrible fantastical tales; but she cited to him the name of old men who had at last selected one living among men, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for she had good reason. He remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was untrue. She detailed to him the terrifying appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing her pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her statements, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural powers of Lord Routhven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ann; her innocence, contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated German girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at length from her, and, forming a pretext for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the things around him, whilst in his mind retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. She was entirely unaware of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She sometimes seemed to part from him with reluctance; but this was because she had no longer found one with whom she could communicate her favours.\nHer guardian was occupied in sketching and uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. On returning, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a place where no Greek would ever remain, after the door had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the vile evils as impending upon him who dared to cross the path. Aubrey made fun of their representatives, and tried to frighten them out of the idea; but when he saw them stand together at once thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nOn Friday morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unannounced; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night had allowed the power of these beings to be more active than he had promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizons there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapid gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted crowd. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in these southerly climates, is almost upon us; immediately the sun sets, night begins: andere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunder had scarcely subsided. During an interval of time heavy rain forced its way through the canopy of foliage, whilst blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with reckless rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and be found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbour's yard of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he clambered, hoping to find someone to guide him to the tavern, or at least attempting to obtain something from the pelting of the storins. As he approcheched, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was started.\nHe slept, but, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he collided, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in conversation with someone, whom he immediately secluded; when witness cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling up upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his head when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light to the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, following his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torch fell upon the mud wasls, and the latch loaded on every individual straw was full of flakes of foot. At the desire of Avrey he searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left alone; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more fell upon him, to see the airy form of his fair conduct crossed brought in a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no red colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a tillness about her face that seemed as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to which the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was said by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was blank and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost uneasily in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constructian, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a motber had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be imposible; but when they certified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incorruptable; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a sudden violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Henderson; by some unaccountable influence he managed to beg of his former comrades to spare the girl he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediction upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, incidentally, happened at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starlled at the sight of him whose image he had so combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impinging almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and concern which he showed, reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to recover, he again degenerated into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apperently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of their orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much changed, and that elasticity of spirit which had hitherto so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atbens; if he sought it amidst the roses he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he went in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He continued to fly scenes, every feature of which created some bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, whom he held so bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They thought much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were largely the inventions of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrawood defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negigence; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the loud report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avrey, imitating the example, retired for a moment from the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting violence, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they resolved at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy rushed to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the call or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon hearing, come to his aid. Ruthven, being wounded, immediately took their coats and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey induced the prisoner to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no longer dislurbed by their presence–they being contentedly to guard the entrance until their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two minutes mortification ensued, and death followed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last meeting, his mind became apparent uneclsy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I know but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot expain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my lips were free from the world's mouth–and if my death was known at the same time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It shall not be disputed.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising himself with exultant violenco, \"Swear! All your soul reveres, by all your natural fear's, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my birth or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and said no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the strange circumstances attending his acquaintance with the man rose upon his mind, and he know not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came upon him, as is from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer the same, having been conveyed by himself and company, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, acceding to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should not be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. When he had reached to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last retried, convinced that they had married so far the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of the company in which he had met some terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared to heighten that suuperstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Amongst other things the box was a case containing seueral weapons of execution, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghanſ. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curiosities, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–bastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular features, the same varylling tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concealing the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arms. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubry's mind became almost broken with so much repeated horror; he was afraid that his lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation eonsisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed contrary to his will, soon wafted him to the English shore; and he visited the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the embraisements and cocks of his sister, in memory of the deceased. If she before, by her infantine caressions, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Andrews had not that winning grace which gained the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of acrowded apartments. Her blue eye was never let up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that of footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colaur may attract—it was sedale and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her present presence forget the grief. She knew destroyed his rest, who would have changed her mind for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the court, it having been thought by her guardians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his friends, and dwell upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interefl about the frivolities of fashion and strangers, when his heart had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been adapted as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessiv–the drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with her sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of anyone approaching him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognised too well, sounded in his ear—\"Renounce your oath.\" He had hardly courage to move, fearful of seeing a spectre which would frighten him, when he perceived, at a small distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almast refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw him into his arms, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were breaking from his mind. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the devil took his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe he was in this place again!–He thought his imagination had conformed up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for when he tried to ask concealing Lord Ruthven, the name came upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining admission. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near family. Leaving her under the protection of a constable, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring of the bought. Perceiving, at last, that many were loaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in earnest conversation; he attempted to approach and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those acts he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, carried her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in possessing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became first distrocted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the maker's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she treated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hands to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, wandered from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who suffered from a greater swirm than any from the illness. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, and endeavour to prevent, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, and his inward shudderings so visibile, that his sister was at once obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDe sirous of protecting him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye any marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and keep constant watch on him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence came at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and affection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks which severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" Whither, how?\nWhen she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence no one could rouse him. This lasted for some months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count on his fingers a definite number, and smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entoring his room, began to convalesce with his physician upon the melancholy occurrence of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was preparing next year to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he listened anxiously to whom. Glad of his mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had acquainted with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them even more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and going to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irisluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once again alive to the feelings of affections. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage to a man so distinguished for rank and every appearance of merit; when he suddenly perceived a locket on her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the man who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a forbidding expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never again see this man, for he– But he could not advance—it seemed as if that voice agitated him. He did not remember his oath, and looked suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicari, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a relight of her disorder, alarmed, and forbore him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to loave him. He fell upon his knees to them, and implored, he begged of them to leave him for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning meeting in the drawing-room, and had been refused with everyone elses. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readly understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasurable could hardly be concealed from those from whom he had gained this irruption. He went to the house of his former companion, and, by constable acquaintance, and the pretence of great affection for the bride and interest in his fate, he gradually wormed the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had years and toils to recount–could speak of him as of an individual hauing no sympathy with any being on the earth, except her to whom he addressed him personally; could tell how, since he knew her, his appearance, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or perhaps it was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The fortunes of the elder branch faltering at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as a catalyst for hastening the engagement, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubroy, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she desired her own happiness, her own horiour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who have held her in their hearts as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few weeks that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he though it best not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a madman. Night passed on without rest to the busy inhabitants of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be conceived than described, the sounds of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avrey grew a most forbidding character. The curiosity of the scruces at first overcame their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand went out of the room, and in a moment found him in the apartment where they were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his hand by surprise, dragged him from the room, speechless with grief. When on the staircafe, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride on this day, your sister is ruined. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him toward his attending officers, who, roused by the crying woman, had come in search of him. Aurey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was consigned to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londonderry.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near opproach of death. He feared his sister's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related precisely what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Avrey's sister had committed the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LLOYD BYRON'S RESIDENCE. THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his clothing.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mityleric in the island of the same name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Brits to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in walking, and the purser bargaining so cottle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had boored before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in Florence. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage upon the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred shillings for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there for fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis accourit excited our interest very much, and we lost no time in hosting to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who directed us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, an adrawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room with a spacious set annexed. They were all simply decorated: pale green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the bars by moving a spring six inches to the side of a bronze Venus in a leering posture; a large couch or sofa complemented the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an enormous book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bed-chamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow–the mother bed through Greece. In the sitting-room we obserued a marble recess, former, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bail.\nRousseau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klapstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradisc Last, an Italian odition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampers from the Greek press at Constantinople, much read, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he called, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to do any thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce from that farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know why.\"\nThe appearance of the house external was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pilasters with black plinths and fret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the rest. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, and an awning of strong coarselinen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon the in the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma chrétis,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breezes.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a steam streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and lime were clustering together on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornate wooden back was placed, on which, we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings.\nEvery morning and night till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and maple trees, several small islands could be observed, contrasting the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this ramantic suite: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"Is I?\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not intended to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt some moral particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton arid silk to the girls who lived there weaving the articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benovolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had given her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the infatuation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mary; our imaginations cocked on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Gloucester could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecclesiastical families which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travalling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harwood\" being put into our bands we recognized the reformation of Calcla in every way. Deeply did we regret not having been more careful in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been gravely slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, indifferent to assocating with humankind, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. The truth is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's pocms, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the prisoner in solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whom God has set her seal, and over whose head Benevalence hath thrown her man. No man can read the preceding passages\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be regarded with caution, particularly when directed upon man's character integrily; and he who dares justly himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may prevent the crrors of a sellow-mortar. Lord Byron's character is worthy of great genius. To do good in secret, and receive the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous character and self-compromising character.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "21": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to have originated, but did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks untill after the establishment of Christianity; and it has evidently assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latjn body would not cease if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and form the subject of many wonderful stories, still popular, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres invariably imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; while these human blood-suckers fattened and their veins became stimulated to such a state of repulsion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a peculiar case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madroyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chicf and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a young soldier named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frantiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth of the vampyr.\nI went to his grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been threatened by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from infection, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proposals having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accuſtional remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, but left his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the endorsement of some persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become aggressors upon others who survived them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person should not be sueked by a stranger.\nPyrcy becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis remarkable occurrence is not related, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the present investigation than any other circumstance which could be adduced. In many part of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to perpetual mourning, but compelled to confine his infernal visits so strictly to those he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, a Prayer sent, Thy corpse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly having left the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stroam of life; Yet loathe the poison which perforce must feed thy livid living cells, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursoring thee, thou cursoring them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloud of all, shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the glassy glanc must view Whose head freezes over its life-light blue; Then with unhallowed haste you must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet will not thy own best blood ball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and wither Gouls and Afrits rejoice, Till these horror shrank away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him for the best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have recovered from the sinsulness of her life, she being persecuted through the whole of the church as a complete type of purity and licentiousness. The veracious Turner gives a long account in his travels of severa astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he professes to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its origins, has put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a cruel, as well as barbaric, errand.\nMany curiosities and interesting nolices on his sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, frequently referred to to explanation, which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the Terrible Varnyphyre is the one in most respects.\nBesides this acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucherelocha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the middle of the dissipations attendant upon the London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he could not by a look quell it, and bore fear into those breasts where untaughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance seemed to pass through the inward workings of the heart; it fell upon the cheek with a heavy ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to sudden excitement, and had felt the weight of enriui, were pleased at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though form and outline were beautiful, many of the female celebrities after notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they dreaded in his affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sown in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But though the common address could not inflame even the corner of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent. He never addressed him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed him to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even exceeded-\nWhether the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of women, he was as often among the females who form the base of their sex by their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aurycy: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to him by guard-jans, who guarded it. It was his duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit cargo of their mind to the employ of mercenary soldiers, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily struck so many jewelers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturacque effluence of the sceno, and we should forget romance altogether. The thought that the misery of apparel merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He though, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers supported him, striving which should describe with least truth their lustful or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightering countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was dismayed at finding, that, except in the tin lanterns and wax candles which flickered, not from the presence of a fire, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundance in real life for any of that collection of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those boxes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compunction in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed of emotion, who showed few other signs of observation of exterrial objects, except the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allawing his imagination to picture everything that flatterd its propensity to exultant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of his romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, better than the persons before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognisably. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affalces were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting his singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for in any generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to make some rapid sleps in the care of vice towards pulting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandrellous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or affection, accarding the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey afterwards mentioning his engagement to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his acts were analogous to his view, the results of others drew different conclusions as to the apparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubroy could not refrain from remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indomitability by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with bardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to indulge in his lust, or to sink him still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich comfort. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generaly prevails over the retiring habits of the virtuous indigent. There was one instance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, invariably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Ayre was surprised at the childishness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashioriable vice; there he entered into all the fashions of the faro table: he bett\nHe always gambled willy-nilly, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he gonerally watched the society: it was not, however, so when he identified the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous children; then it very much seemed fortune's law—the apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the cat whilst dallying with the half-deceased mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, lorn from the circle headorned, crying, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate which had drown him wit in the reach of this fiend; whilst many a mother was frantic, amidst the speaking calls of mute hungry children, without a shred of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grip of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey of course wished to reproach this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the object of his life, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it; each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and only to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his engagement, and amidst the most wonderful wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye seemed less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater pleasure from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exolted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he loft him in daily attendance upon the morning appearance of an Italian countess, whilft he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engclosed, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his friends, the latter astonished him; if it had hitherto entered into his imagination that there was an extraordinary power residing in his companian, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately laying his hands, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discredited, not that his contempt for the accused had originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to increase his gratificatory, that his victor, the partner of his guill, should be hurled from the paradise of unsullied utility, down to the lowest abyss of insamy and degradation: in fine, that all the females whom he had fought, apparent on account of their virtuosity, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposethe whole deformity of their bodies to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon loosing one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to ensure no slight circumstances might be noticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is accepted in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's curiosity followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rutherford, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have voted for such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Henry retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other parts, and, calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to his daughler, but also concernig the character of his Lordhip. The assault was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his solicitor to notify him of his complete consent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left England, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of antiquity upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured licheri. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, for beautification and divinity, that she might have served the model for a painter wishing to pour tray upon tray the promised paradise of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she darted upon the plain, or tripped alighting the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; who would have exchanged her eye, appareritly the eye of animated passion, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal sujited, but to the surprise of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncorrupted girl, engaged in the pursuit of a black ashmerc butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagle gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an alm effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses floating, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly changing hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who had let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of of great importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and suffocating balls. Whilst he drew up the remains of which he wished to preserue a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him, all the glowing colours of happy memory, the marriage parties she remembered viewing in her youth; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talismans of her nurse. Her excitement and apparence, and belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his exultence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last identified one living among them, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so insensible, she begged of him. You must believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question the existence, always had some reason, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of the monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rutbven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fear, but at the same time he wondered about the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernal power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey beg to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected vivacity of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hails, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some alcoholic researches, he would depart, determined not to return till his object was attached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins before him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his senses, and was ever the frank infantile being he had first known. She sometimes seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some mystery which had yet escaped the destructiveness of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with sober present, confirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Shortly after, Aubrey decided to proceed up an avenue of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever return, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vompyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounc\nHe regarded the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproach, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very narne of which apparent made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unassisted; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fiends, had filled them with such terror. When he was about to depart, Bartholomew came to the side of his horse, and most sincerely begged him to return, for night allowed the power of these being to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, howevr, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twiligh, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its ochoing thunder had robbed him of rest—its thick heavy rojn forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the billowing dark clouds seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity from the scene. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of the woman mingling with a stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost urbane sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: but God, bowever, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediatoly seized; when a voice cried, \"Again beaten!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his wife as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his accomplice threw himself up upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now strong, and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches flickered up from the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. On the discovery of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was almost in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the body of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition? He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a sudden impression arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the woman for in, when he closed them, stretched out her side. There was no blood upon her cheek, nor upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that dwelt there: upon her neck and shoulders was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A VICTORY!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A crowd was quickly formed, and Avrey was laid by the side of her who had long been to him the object of so much bright and fairy visioris, now lying with the flaw of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconscionably in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the church, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascerained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was sometimes delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable cambulation he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate murder upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, however, decided at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, on hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now cambined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rulham, by his kind words, implying full repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the admiration, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His face seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his confidence began to be rapid, he again degenerated into the fame state of mirid, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former in him, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed directly upon him, with a smirk of malicious exultation paying upon his lips: he knew not why, but his smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Routhven was apprentrently engaged in watching the tldeless waves stirred by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless surface;–indeed, he appeared to wish to observe them through the eyes of a hawk.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguisbed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a master of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for serenity, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Isabella's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her long step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He witnessed many fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hasteried from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuols, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangors. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitant, on occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rock brought down from the neighhouring precipices, they had reason to perceive negligence; for scarcely were the members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of cannon fire. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Mr. Auhrey, imitating his example, retired for a moment behind the shoring turri of the defile: but ashamed of being detained by a foe, who with jovial shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, without considering the contest or his own position, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces upon him—his guards having, upon Lord Rulbven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence, his duty being merely to guard the entrance till his comrades could return with the promised sum, far which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days death ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious as before. He had been of the objects about him, but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became suddenly unhinged, and his eyes fell upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance wit more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I dread the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my horiour, your friend's horiour. \"How? Tell me? I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life goes apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know from me, my lips were free from stain in the world's mouth.\" If death were unknawn for some time in England–I—I–but not now. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swoar!\" He addressed the dying man, raising himself with exultant vigour,\"Swear by all your soul revere s, by all yovre fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or what you may see. His eyes seemed to burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man remained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the present impression of something horrible awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the pistol, when a rabber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, on his retiring, to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise. They had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first bright ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the window, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clots, though the robbers swore they pointed to the identical rock on which they had left the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortune, and in which all apparently endeavoured to beighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had wil be belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offerice, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alagharis. Whilst turning them over, and examining their mysterious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the kitchen hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may have imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerned the lady he had attempted to snatch from London. Ruthless arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destrayer of M'Caffery. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in reading the names of the post offices, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embrasures and cuffs of his sister, all memory of the past. If she befor, by her infidelity, had gained his affections, when the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never let up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indelicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which slays where a butterfly or a colossus may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the sorrows of the world? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only seventeen, and had not been presented to the court, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed up with the melancholy which afflicted him.\n-powered him. He could not take interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a draw-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were eager to bask in the smilc of royalty, had their turn.\n-er. Aubrey was here with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, completely unaware of all around him, engaged in the remembrance of the first time he had seen Lard Routh—when he was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the orm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would last him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven looked before him–circumstances stood up in dreadsome array–the dagger–his oath–He surprised himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossiblant that he could obtain money–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthvon, the name having upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few weeks after with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his disturbing habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he nearly impeded the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he heard that servant whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"\nHe did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, he reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed on one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to inquire into what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified him. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His heart sank; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, a midst which he should be held dear, and not oppose its progress? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discharge his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing sorrow and solitude, he left his house, and wandered from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became degraded, and he was often exposed to the noon-day sun and to the midnights damps. He was no longer to be recognised; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend arrayed against them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter into full-fledged religious fociety, and went with him quietly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven corresponded with with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and suspensory looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from feeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unsatisfactory, the guardians bought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesired of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in his house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so perfectly was his mind abscorbed by one terrible suction. His incoherence became at last so great that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of getting up. He had became emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy state; the only sign of affection and excitement reinaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would make something start, and, seizing her hands, with something that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to strike him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guards observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so odd a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attatched; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of the mark of returning intellect, of which they felt he had been deprived, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that was a young Earl whom he had met with in fociety, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again incapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flawing at the thought of her brothor's being ever more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accoutrement; when he suddenly perceived a lockel upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portraiture in a paroxysm of rage, and threw it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hand, and going on her with a frantic expression of passion, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if someone had bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought it was but a return of his disorder, entered, and, upon forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He called upon his friends to come, he implored, he begged of them to come but for one day. They, attribting this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and succeeded.\nLord Ruthven had called the meeting after the drawing-room, and had been rofused with every one present. When he heard of Avrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those upon whom he had passed the information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the oar of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails to recount–could speak of him as an individual having no sympathy with anyone on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, sir, he knew her, his acquaintance, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, be knew so well how to work the serpent's tongue, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling too short to bear, belonged an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before her departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the marriage with heavy words. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on with no rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving him in the custody of an exhausted old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speckled with blood. When on the staircase, Lord Rutledge.\nHe had whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not your bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frak! So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Lyon.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Andrews when they arrived.\nBy then, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain variety of excitement and entertainment always to be had there, duee many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Scotland, its attractions amply repay the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the valley, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser barging for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The coltage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hurridred zochines for it, (about £250 in value,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the distant islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closets annexed. They were simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large mahogany window in the centre, and a small fountain nearby, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English books, and an empty book-case: here were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had perfectly a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recoss, formerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamari's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaire's, Schlespeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmorman, in the Gerrnan language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novellas; Schiller's The Day of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several masques from the Greek press at Constantinople, somewhat worn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a penknife, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally sorbled all over, and surrounded with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with him, he would frown upon me for a week; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechines which I pawn to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was displeasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted inarble pillars with black plinths and fret-work corrieices, (as it is now customary in Grecian arcitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpot, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are fully furnished, as upon them the Grecks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christl,\" eating sruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were accumulating together on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamented wooden back was placed, upon which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"or always attended our children twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with live oak and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an arch unshadowed by a single clove, terminates the view in front; and a little way on the left, giving a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-lifts, several small islands were distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"culd call, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, my friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to examine the Armenian, but on our return to the lowlands we learnt several particulars of the isolated place. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by buying these articles. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament's to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friends at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forto, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylerie; our inquiries all on the run, wondering who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar character. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had eighteen travels in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"against whom you are so anxious, is Lard Byrori; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had not then heard of his ship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more careful in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Ille on some future day. To me that day will be another retrial. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly neglected. He has been described as of an unfceasing disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or participating in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasvres. The fact is direly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sirier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, see to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatry, and sympathy appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasuring \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasours, I do not assume it necessary to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius.

    "22": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this lale is founded is very germy in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be extinct: it did not riot, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has ony assumed its present form from the division of the Latin races; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if respected in their doctrines, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful legends, still extant, of the dead rising from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed that vampyres night had imbibed a certain portion of the blood of the victims, who afterwards, lost their lives.\nThey subsequently died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of violence, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hesse. It appears, that upon an examination of the counsel-in-house and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmated, that, about ten years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been happy to say that, in Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of it, by eating some of the earth out of the creature's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre again; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further misehief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accusatory remedy. A stake was driven entrely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the relatives of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become aggressors against others who survived them.\nThe general belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThismonstrous robbery is here referred, because it seems better adapted to illuminate the subject as the principal observations than any other means which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst living, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most upon earth—those to whom he was closest by means of kindred and affection.A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nFirst on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt its former place, and suck the blood of all thy race; Therefrom thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the marrow of life; Yet loathe the bariquet which will perforce feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, Shall know mercy for their sire. As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that your crime must soll, the yovngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—That name shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet you must end thy task and mark her cheek's last lash, her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must witness which freezes over its life-sins blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, lock when shorn Affection's deepest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of terrible agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then talking to thy sullen grave, Go–and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sullivan has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo,\" the vampyre character of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best known whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sordidness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The voracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several unfortunate cases of vampyrism, to which he pretend to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, contains also some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany interesting and inleresting notices on this singular horrible superstition might be added; though the subject may suffice for the limits of a volume, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in different parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardouacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the middle of the dissipalions attended upon a Lord Mayor, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the milling crowd, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracled his attention, that he must by a quick quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where homosexuality reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object of face, did not seem to pulse, and at no glance to point towards the inward working of the heart; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be irrevited by every one who wished to see him, and those who had once accumulated to voracious excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleaded at having something in their presence capable of engaging their imagination. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which had gained a warm tint, either from the blufh of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after him attempted to win his affection, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparent fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unopposed impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common advice could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was clear that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his siriguar character, or that they were moved by his apparent lack of vice, he was as often among those femmes who form the boast of their sex from their domineering virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of medical authorities, he cultivated more imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which drowsily ruins many milliners' appearances. He believed all men sympathized with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque esfect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely concealed in the dressing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured palches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, fronk, and rich: from these qualities, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which they could describe with least respect their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into their ranks of friends and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax eandles that fluttered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in his life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, no salvation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea as the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other indications of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their conduct: allowing his imagination to picture any thing that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his sancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attenions, and became so advanced in his career, that his reputation was almost recovered. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarassed, and soon learned, from the notes of preparation in Bow-street, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the direction of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allawing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or praise, a reference to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately communicating his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity as studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from him more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not refrain from remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant upon virtue, that he beowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the vicarious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuoso.\nMONDAY. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that it was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the caffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Avrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his character sought for the centres of all fashionable vices; there he succeeded into the splittings of the far-side table: he betled, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonism, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he constantly watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of youth, or the luckless fortunes of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed contrary to law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of the dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat sadly, amids the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith he could buy even sufficient to satisfy his principal craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tab; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the corruptive grasp of the innocent: this was but the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friends.\nI, and beg him to resign for charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own. He delayed it–foreach day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and open to him; however, nothing further occurred. Lord Russell in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and curious scenef of nature, was much the same: his eye seemed less than half-closed; and when Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excltement of vainly wishing to see the man in myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something superriatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Wilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affections; the others were from his guardians, the latter terrified him; if it had not already entered into his mind that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seem to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediatly leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicarious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more destructive to society. It had been clear, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in any criticism of her character; but that he had required, to ensure his gratification, that the subject, the part of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unfullied virlue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the deforrnity of their vicars to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single right point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the marriage of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly governed. In Ireland, it is seldom that an unmarried man is met with in society; he was therefor induced to carry on his plans in secrecy; but Aubrey's eyes followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were the same as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired, and, shortly writing a note, to say, that from this moment he must refrain from accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his serjeant to seek other assurances, and falling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he know, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assizes was postponed. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify him subject to a summons; but did not hint any suspicion of his person having foiled Aubrey's assassination.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey continued his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Alhens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory up to monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had borne their remains beneath the sheltering soil of monochrome caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's parodise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced up and down the plain, or tripped down the mountain's slopes, one would have bought the gazelle a particular type of beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauly of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an odd effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from him the very object he had been forc thought of with regard to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms wbich all see, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling stalls. Whilst he drew up the remains of which he wished to compose a memorial for his future hour, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the ceccling dance upon the open plain, which would appear to him in all the glowing colours of youthful imagination, and with pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently struck a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she represented, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and nearest tics, forced his death last year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fern. [SUBJECT OF ATTEMPT.] If he extended his arm too far the breaking moriths, his blood would run out, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible statements; but she clung to him in the names of old friends, who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, all but had had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to believe it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her irinocence, so contrastd with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vocation of romanco, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an educated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away at times from home, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to direct his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained a mind that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infarctile being he had first known. She sometimes considered to part from him with reluctance; but this was because she had no longer a friend with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovincing some fragrant which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed the existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Avrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most horrid evils as impending upon him who dared to cross the path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very power of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silenced.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy holy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of their horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, he had the come to the side of his horse, and endeavoured to retrace his steps, but could not allow the power of these horses to be put in motion; he surrendered. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, determined, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost instantaneous; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above–it for echoing thunders had hardly an interlude of rest–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whils the furious lightning seemed to flicch and radiate al his very feet. Suddenly his horse gave fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled mass. The animal at last, thrugh fatigued, stopped, and he found, by the gare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up above the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he clambered, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he appraached, the thunders, for a moment filent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apperently unperceived; but, when he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in conflict with someone, whom he immediately seized; but then a volce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to fell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with remarkable force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the gap, and after a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The stock was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon hoarded by those without. They advanced; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the flames loaded on every individual straw with heavy flokes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair companion brought in a lifeless condition. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was bloo On her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein, and to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her husband, who had late last been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visjons, now fallen with the flower of life that had died upon her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was blanked and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in violence–he held almost uncansciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different parties who had been engaged to the fear of her whom a third had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the canal, forewarned the parents of some dreadsul catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they expressed the sorrow of their child's death, they looked to Aubrey, and pointed to the corsice. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most intense fever, and was often delirious; in these intervents he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some accountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare him from being loved. At other times he would inflict maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, happened at this time to arrive at Athons, and, from what seems certain recollection, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and he came his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him, whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impinging almost repentance for the foul play which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so enflamed Aubrey; but as soon as his change began to be rapid, he again gradually relired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived a distinct difference in the form of man, excepl that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a sinister expression playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this spectre haunted him. During the last stage of the prisoner's recavery, Lord Ruthven was apparely engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the prevailing breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the inoveless sun;—indeed, he seemed to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's character, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so delighted him now seemed to have deserted him for ever. He was now as much a lover of seclusion and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he searched it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Arithe's form stood by his side—if he sought it in, the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the first violet; then sudde-\nHer slowly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly there, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but when they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a large stream, wth large inosses of rock cascading down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for suddenly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant the guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a short time behind the shetering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them adieu, and being committed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the prisoners should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubroy remained to his assistance; but, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded prisoner to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content mere to guard the entrance till their comrade should reply with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Rutledge's fortune rapidly decreased; in a few days inflammation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hosty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as sure of himself as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mood became apparently uneasy, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me! Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the dictates of fate as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. My life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and my death were unknown for some time in England. \"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, rising from his chair with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all that your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whom you may see. His eyes sprang bursting from their sackets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sprang laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the painful circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose up in his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of some horrible awaiting event. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubry astonished, and taking several of the men, decided to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers had picked out the identical rock on which they had laid the bady. For a time his mind was lost in conjectures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of the country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighle that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the accused. There were fatal daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently made in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut? He shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it sat, very peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubry's mind became overwhelmed under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this day he would fall a victim to the destroyer Antony. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation remained in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, carried him to the Englisb shores; and he proceeded to the mansion of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and company of his friend, all memory of the post. If she before, by her infantine acquaintances, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was now more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not the winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the hoated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy air about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunc, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consciences of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may add—it was sedate and placid. When alone, her face was never brimming by the smoulders of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her mind forget those complaints she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own private sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her present appearance should be delayed until her brother's return from the Continent.\nThere came a time, when he might be her protector. He was, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel in the least about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held in some time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastoned to see it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember me!\" He had scarcely courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a slight distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed upon him, and his limbs almost refuslng to bear the weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw him into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven came aground before him–circumstances started in a drooping array–the dagger was out–He roused him, but he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be permitted, the before, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by six men, apparently in some conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those creatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried steps, flung her tawards the street. At the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubery was almost dislracted. If before his mind had been occupied by some subject, but much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's coming attack pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now directed, and it was in this regard that she intreated him to explain to her whal had caused such corrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a shame; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer able of bearing stillness and seclusion, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to see the image which haunted him. His dress become noglected, and he wandered, as of course exposed to the noon sun.\n-Day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no stranger to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to have seen; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to watch him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a policeman swift enough to ban him from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abscence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose favour they were accustomed, he determined to enter again into society, and watched him steadily, anxiously, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven apprached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought better to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesired of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and in preveriting him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one particular subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There would often be no sleep for days, impossible of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that almost afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him!–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a pall of its gloom, which his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe boy had nearly clapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with the physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being. It was so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he listened anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had lost, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met before in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They spoke not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again guilty of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's coming on more alive to the feelings of affection. He went to speak with all his wonled warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and very accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus deslroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of conviction, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for be– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice had bade him rejoin his oath–he turned sudden round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physioian, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning in the drawing-room, and had refused with every one else. When he learned of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasurable could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He resorted to the house of his former compère, and, by constable Atteridance, and the pretences of great affection for the latter and interest in his fate, he gradually wormed his ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pounce? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of him as of an indignant being having no sympathy with any being on the known earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell that, since he knew her, his existence, had ceased to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might mimic her sooty accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the ferpentine art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an importan embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged behaviour,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any one in the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a lunatic. Last night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of earrings broke up his ear. Aubrey grew aloof and frarreful. The curiosity of the servants at last overeame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with oath bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approoched, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, nearly in rage. When they reached the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remain by your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, surprised by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage at finding out, had produced a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to hospital. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnised, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he relaled compositedly what the reader has perused–and died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Routh had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, he were to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Soiling the Grecjan Arcipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Messina, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—thousands of men on war and merchantmen; and since it lies rather out of the track for ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while first the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the villagers, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greck, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechinos for it, (about L250 Engish currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity unmercifully, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor–an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room–with a spacious close annexed. They were all simply decoraled: plain green-stained wood, marble bases on either side, a large laurel in the centre, and a small fauntain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fluted in the shape of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a chair or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Eriglish cane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed-chaucer had a large mallet.\nHe spread on the sloor, with two stuffed cotlan quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chair in the closet: it was empty, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousfaux's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germari languagc; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with margin notes, written with a penknife, in Italian and Latina. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to pace them with the keys; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so peculiar, that were I to move one thing out of orders, he would frown upon me for a week to come; he is otherwise very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an old Armenian who resides in a small cottage near the road, and whom the lord broughl here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The column in front was five feet long and thirteen feet broad, and the fluted marble pilings.\nThe pillars with bay plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architekture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone archustrade, was covered by a fine Tertiary carpet, beneath an awning of strong crape lace. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frut, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nIn the back hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtles bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his meals and nights til twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this spot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mourit Calcata, surrounded with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the mountain descended in broken cascades, and it was found in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon vowned by a single clover, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, beyond a vista of lofty chesnut and maple-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this remote settlement: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Cambridge. \"The Armerian,\" said our officer, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare.\" We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on our return to the town we learnt some particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one son, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Onc circumstance we learnt, which our friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the fat was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piana-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiars. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dissipated. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archivist, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiously afraid, Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tericdos, and I last visited him at Milylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more diligent in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, belleving the riot quite uninteresting, and in service to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been discharged.\nHe spoke as of an unseeing disposition, indifferent to associaling with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer pleasures of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, should have their seat in his bosom. Terribleness, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an important reason for marking him as a man on whose head Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantles. No man can repeat the preceding pleasing \"traits\" wit-\nHe went feeling proud of himself as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reprisals are ever to be received with displeasure, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares defend himself before the awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-street, Fleet-street.",
    "23": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. For the Armenians it appears to be common: it did not riot, however, extend itself among the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has gradually assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually incroased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain proportion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of complications; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their uppers came distended to such a state of replolion, as to cause the blood to flow from the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a peculiar occurrence of vampyrism, which is purported to have occurred at Madrcyga, in Hungary. It appeared, that upon an examination of the coin-manager-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they posilatively and unarbitrarily affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or twenty-three days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his blows. To prevent further miscegenation, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of ampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from contamination, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Praying having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed romedy. A stakc was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which He is said to have died out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in turn, become agents upon others who survived.\nThe general belief is, that a person fucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomantade is not related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirism, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved in earnest while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of indrawn and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gael.\"\nBut first on earth, on Vampyresent, thy soul shall from its tomb be rent; Then it shall haunt the present place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the thief of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perfusion must feed thy living creatures; Thy victims, when they expire, shall know the dejection for their sire; As currying thee, thou musting them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall crown thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her check's last breath–her eye's last spark, and the last gassy glance upon a view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then will her unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, life a lock when her Majesty's fondest pledge was worn– But now if borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet will thy own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Then stalking to thy sorrowful grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles, till the so in horror run away from spectre more clearest than they.\nMr. Soulhey has also introduced in his wild story the beautiful character of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre cousin of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of remonstrating with the man she best loved whilst in exile. But she cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being regarded throughout the whole of the world as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracruz Tremendour gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been on eyewitness; and Metcmet, in his great work upon this subject, which contains a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth several learned disserlations, tending to prove it to be a cliche, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible occurrence might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mercifully remarking, that though the word Vampyrc is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, in use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the first of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, the sun appeared al the varied parts of the loadings of the ton a robberman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those parts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance did not pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the chest with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin so that it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and eyes were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice: –but in vain: when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence him without the guidance of his eyes, it was not riot that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virluous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wirling tongue; and how well it was used. It even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were made by his apparent habits of vice, he was as often among the females who form the base of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among the ones who sully it by their vicos.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentloman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an unmarried sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alone to his own guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the company's military subalterns, he cultivated more his magination through his judgements. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the seene, as we see in romance. He thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm as wool, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realilies of life. He was handsome, frick, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers pursued him, striving which would describe with full truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lodged him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the memory of that solitary hour, he was startled at finding, that, except in the lallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from witchcraft and snuffling, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to resume his duties, when the extraordinary being we have just described, crossed him in his robes.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few outward signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to pry everyhing that flattered his propensity for extravagant idea's, he soon formed this object in his mind the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, more than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his career, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrased, and soon learned, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guards that it was time for him to perform the task, which for any generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stepf in the career of vicars towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and riot allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his inlentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by her a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, she gratefully accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the witnesses offered different conclusions from the opparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his generosity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Mr. Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant on virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent through the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prisoner came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his sorrow, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was now more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that it was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the seasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent ease with which his companion sought for the centres of fashionable vice; the man heentered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with succes, except where the sharper was his antagonist, and the he lost even more than he gained; but it was always the same uranging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encourited the rascally youthful novice, or the luckless falher of a numerous families; then his very wish secured fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the day wbilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, lorn from the circle he adomed, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him within the reach of this fury; whilst many a father sat frantic, amid the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but deliberately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had snatched from the immediate grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable as combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey intended to convey this to his friend, and to urge him to renounce the charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some appartunity of speaking frankly and operatively to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven was in his carriage, and amidst the various wisps and rich scenics of life, was always the fame: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he had no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of constantly wishing to break some mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assumc the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whil he went in search of the motherorials of an almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impudence; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his friends, who abused him; if it had not been entered in his imagination that there was an evil power discernible in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belittlement. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and charged, that his character was dreadful and vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more disgusting to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to increase his glory, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtuosity, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: and that all the female companions whom he had soured, apparently on account of their vices, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of the vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon marrying one, who character had not hitherto shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext for abandoriing him altogether, purporting, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight disturbance pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he frequented. In Italy, it is customary that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubroy's curiosity got the better of him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an appointment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, thoughtless girl. In no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his interitions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her very soon. Lord Routh answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would be upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. He retired, and, afterwards writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of her Lordship. The assignation was postponed. Lord Ruthven next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hold any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's intrigues.\nHaving left Rorne, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself at Athens. He then fixed his position in the manner of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in following the faded recards of anient glory upon manuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured flowers. Under the same roof as himself, afflicted a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for any painter wishing to pour light on the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, and tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor typician of her beauties; for who would have excused her eye, apparently the eye of animated passion, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Harriet osten accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and of course the uneonscious girl, engagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, surrendered the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost emaciated tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the artist, who let escape from his imprisonment the very object he had before him of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Paris.\nSUBJECT. It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by erowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate? Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his late hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then descibe to him the eircling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colour of youthful memory, the morriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irascibility; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she told, excited the imagination even of Aubrey; and often when she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years among his friends, and decamped every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrble fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, having at first detected one living creature among themselves, after severa of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stomp of the fiend's appelite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giving, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of those monsters, and his horror was increased, by hoaring a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth to her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had led to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her beauty, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had unfriendly for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more, and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attached; but he always found it impossible to keep his attention upon the ruins and her, when first his mind obtained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of love, and was ever the same frank infantile boing he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some secret which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyref, and they both, with counsel present, affirm their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at once, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the custom of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a powerful, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly pleaded of him to return, for night allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not stop.\nHe at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. The day-light would soon end, and on the horizon there was one of those pecks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the dovoted country. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, nigh upon midnight, and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its thundering thunders had scarcely an interlude of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnings seemed to foll and radiate from his very feet. Suddenly he took fright, and he was carried with dreadfulness through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismissing, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the tawn, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the crowd, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exuberant laughter.\nThe constant mockery of a laugh, contrivance in one enormous unbroken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the wind, however, comforted him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found him in company with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again beaten!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by someone who seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feel and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands on his throat–when the glare of many torches perching through the hole which gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the gap, was no longer beard. The fury was now still; and Aubroy, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their tarches fell upon the mud wasls, and the torch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again locked in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was merely a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheok, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stench about her face that seemed most attached as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast hair, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A VICTORY!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side as her wife had once been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now scallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to flee reflection, and take refuge in vacuity–he held almost indecisively in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of a disastrous catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a first violent fever, and was osten delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable circumstance he seemed to think of his former companions, and would spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate curses upon his head, and curse Mary as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, however, managed at this time to arrive at Arms, and, from whatever motley, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his companion. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, indicating his most repentance for the sin which had causod their separation, and still more by the kindness, anxiously, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that pathetic being who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of molicious exultation passing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the course of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moving sun; but, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this blow, was much weakened, and that energy of spirit which had once distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's face would not be by his side; or if he went into the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a rueful smile upon her lips. He determined to fly from every circumstance of which he created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of her during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They had much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reputations, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generality of those whom they had fended from pretended danglers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, to serve as guides and as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow depression, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had no opportunity to repent their mistake; nor scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the quarrels, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed firing of several guns. In an instant their hands had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sinister turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting words had insulted them at once, and being exposed to immediate slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb out and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush farward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him down. Mr. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer bearing his burden or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being contracted merely to guard the entranco till their comrade would return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and he seemed advancing wit hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as before. He had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to affer his assistance with more than voracious earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean my life, I heed the death of an acquaintance as much as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's courts–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by al that your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my birth or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon the pavement, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the present knowledge of something horriblous awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robbor met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after death. Aubrey appalled, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he descended to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers themselves pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time his mind was filled in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burjed the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a courting in which he had met with some terrible misfortunes, and in which had apperently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortrant, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing seven different woapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were many daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a hand-knife apparent in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he hold in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to believe; but the peculiar form, the same varying tints upon the haft and blade, were alike in splendour on both sides, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Manchester, and on his way back to Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deportation of his lordship. Aubrey's mind was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infrequent caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brillicuity which ony exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was red lit up by the levity of the laughter beneath. There was a melancholic charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coruscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which sometimes strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened with the smile of joy; but when her husband came-\nHe who breathed to her his affection, and would in her mind forgot those griefs he knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the sorrows of the regimentry? It seemed as if the eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own living sphere. She was yet only eight years old, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardian more fit that her prescence should be delayed until her brother's return from the confinement, when he might be her proteotor. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been filled by the horrors he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–adrawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aunty was there with her sister. While he was standing in the corridor by himself, feeling the presence of all around him, engaged in the remoration that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the clasp, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remain your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fear of seeing a pistol that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little moment, the same figment which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He struggled till his limbs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if ho were afraid his brains were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven stood before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused him, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was clear that it could not be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lothrd Ruthven, the name hung up from his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights afterwards with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave herself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an adjoining room, found his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in attendance; he attempted to pass through and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revelled to him those features he abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with burried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath.\"\nHe did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If so much of his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was he engrossed, now that the menace of the monster's living again pressed upon his senses. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to expain to her what had caused his abominable conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he heard, the more he was bewildered. His oath bound him; was he then to allow this man to roam, bearing ruin upon his body?\nBut, amidst all he beld dear, and not avert its progress? His sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspendants, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to prevent the creature from becoming a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, far her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight gloom. He was no man to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, emulated people to soow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuer swifter than he could run from it. His can duct, however, had recently changed. Struck with the idea that he was surrounded by his enemies, many of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom he knew they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his shaggard and suspicious looks wore so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from soeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to reconsider, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was time to reconsider that rule which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had frequently encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye the marks of what they considered solly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had ottained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the appearance of his face; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, would desire her not to throw him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence even she could not rouse him. This lasted several months; gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times during the day he would place upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, beg to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he looked anxiously to whom. In consequence of this mark of returning acquaintance, of which they feared he had been duped, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and excited them still more by his expressing his intention to be preserver at the nuptials, and desiring to marry his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the touch of her brother's hand, and once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with his wonted wife, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a man so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was most surprising was beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reputation of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if someone's voice again made him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking aloud. Ruthven went near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, persuaded her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aury's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this distinction. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, and, by constant agitation, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gained the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover; could speak of himself as of an individuated being on the crowded earth, with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for forbidding the marriage, (in spite of his brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the same day before his deportation for the confinement.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the witnesses, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own house, and the honour of those now in the grave, who had held her in their arms and their hope and the hope of their house, to delay for a few days their marriage, in which he denounced the most heavy circumstances. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Misfeasant Aubreyby, what he called, the habits of a maniac. Night passed on without rest for the busy mates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of a busy prisoner. Morning come, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew a most forbidding beard. The curiosity of the servants at once obtaining their vigour, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an almostpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by surprise, hurried from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Re member your oath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonored.\" Women are \"slaughterers!\" He saying, he directed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's symptoms increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He hoped his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hurried to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where he chose his pace of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Messina, on the island of Norne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induced many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and armymen; and although it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply pay for the cost of a voyage. We resided, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myelf took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the country four days previous on our arrival in Florence. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am like to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hearth, commanding the river, belonged to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 in current currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very osten to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-rooom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large laurel in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. Inthe hall stood half a dozen English cane books, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor asingle paintings. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow–the comman bed brought from Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large servant's chest in the closet: it was empty, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltairc's, Shakspeel's, Boileau's, and Rousfeau's works complete; Vanney's Rulings of Empires; Zimmermann, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1846; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with argentinian notos, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with small pieces of paper, which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading some books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon us for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him good service; and I have the produce of his farm for the troublings of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the use externally was puzzling. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pilasters with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Georgian architeeture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Grays pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the cool breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which, we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and mornings till two o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this window was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Montcalm, covered with olive and inyrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascodes, until it was last in the woods near the plaintiff's house. The sea smooth as glass, and almost unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chocnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom occupied a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armee.\"\n\"I,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had no time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to those who live by weaving these articles. He so bought a new boat from a fisherman who had no own in a village, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the uniformation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our intimations all on the raok, guessing who this rainbler in Grecce could be. He had money, it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company was Mr. FOSTER, the archivist, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, if Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenodos, and I last saw him at Manchester.\" We had not then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chichester Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Caxton in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is quite the reverse, as can be plairily gathered from these little anecdotes. The finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly deposed in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatry, and charitably affections to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hat thrown her mantles. No man can read the preceding praising \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before the awful tribunal where all must appear, all may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of genius. To do goad in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous character and serene consent.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "24": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very germy in the East. Arnong the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin bady could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it rapidly increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and foaming upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres occasionally imitated a concentration of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speciously died on consumptions; whilst some human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unequivocally affirmed, that, about sixty years ago, befo-\nMr. Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had good reason to say, that, at Cassovia, on the fringes of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, out of twelve or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the dead, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and pure blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and chest of Arnold Paul, at which he is reporled to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents against others who had survived them.\nThe universal rule is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monograph is here related, because it is better adapted to illustrative the meaning of the present observations than any other that could be adduced. In any parts of Greece it is considered as a form of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed first in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to perpetual misery, but compelled to confine his infernal sights soley to those beings he loved most while on this earth—those to whom he was bound by the ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which will perforce feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As curslaining thee, and cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet come to the end of this task and mark her cheek's last tear, her eye's last gasp, and the last glancing blow which freezes her lifeless blue; then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in a lock when born Affection's fondest pledge was worn, but now is borne away by thee Memorial of her agony! Yet still the best bload shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Til these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than this.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is presented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormonting him the best loved whilst in existence. All this can be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a peculiar type of purity and innocence. The voracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several infamous cases of vampyriſm, to which he prends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his researches upon the subject, beside a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible occurrence might be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general application, there are severa others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of great dissipation during a London week, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a man, more remarkable for his singularities, than for his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in it. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those brats whose thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, slanting upon the officer's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce thrugh to the inward workings of the heart; but it fell upon the chest with a crushing ray that weighed upon the skull so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now feasted on the welght of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly nature of his career, which never gained a warmer tone, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though his form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the object of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, although his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceiving; even her appalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But since the prosecutrix could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the unfortunate wife and innocent daughter, that no one knew he ever addressed them to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and what it was that made him famous. The dread of his singular character, or that he wore moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those male who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister, the possessor of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who ought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which destroys so many manufacturers' apprentices. He expected all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence morely for the destructive effect of the scena, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and varied coloured patches. He thought, in fino, that the dreams of children were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their lustful or romping favourions: the doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, have led him into their notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at seeing that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the pleasure of a giggle, but from want of light, there was no soundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasurable pictures and doscriptions contained in those valumes, from which he had removed his study. Firming, however, for compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstance we have above described, ruined him and his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed few other signs of his observation of others, than the total assent to their appearance, implied by the avoidance of contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in his mind as the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advertised upon his notice, that his reputation was well recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Russell's chambers were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his friends, that it was time for him to perform the deed, which for many generations has been theught necessary to enceinte the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when some scandalous inlrigues are mentioned as the subjects of praise or scorn, according to the degree of skill shewn in carriages.\nRipping them on. He consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, she gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubry had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found, that although many more of his actions were expased to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the appearances to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idler, the vagabond, and the boggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot on the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowod his alms;–these were sont from which he hardly suppresed any one; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wollow in his sorrow, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater irportunity of the vicious, which germinally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charley of his Lordship, which was still more improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject miseries. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprized at the apparent ease with which his company sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; here he entered into all the spirit of the table: be betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was the antagonist, and then be loathed even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which ho generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouraged the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fathoms of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed forune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the devil whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn from the circle he adored, staring, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hurrying children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficiency to satisfy their prescritive craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately gave, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey of Lyon wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend for his own profit; but he delayed in doing so for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and dramatic scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the consternation excitement of vainly endeavouring to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nHe soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the inemorials of an officer almost deserted. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an extraordinary power resident in his companion, the letters seemed to give him sufficient reason for the suspicions. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits exceedingly dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in spite of her character; but that he had required, to ensure his gratification, that she, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fact, all the females whom he had fought, apparently on account of their vices, had, since his departure, thrust even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their habits to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon seizing one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to obtain some pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumferences pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavuring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with such respect in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though somewhat less beautiful girl. Losing no time. He entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his opinion with respect to the lady, intimating him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to intimate her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would heap upon such an accapœion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. AUBREY RETURNS.\nUpon hearing this, and, immediately writing a letter to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his serjeant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also ooncerning the character of her Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his consent to a separation; but did not hint any suggestion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsular, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monoliths which apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only bosom sloves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as Mahomet himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicately, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much mirid for any one to think she could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, appareritly the eye of animatod nature, for the sleepy luxurious eye of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconsious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagle gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decoded upon an almost effacodulous ledge, in the intensity of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, and she flitted around, and in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the clerk, who let escape from his mind the subject he had before considered of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, you see, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those memories of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magistrates efface his memory, in tracing the scenes of her past place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the opera plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her youth. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, foreed every year, by foeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of some idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who have at last detected him vamping among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the traces of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question his existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreak, to believe it was true. She described to him the traditiorial appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to exite a belief in the supernatral power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to regard himself more and more in awe of her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtue of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of marriage, wormed his heart; and while be ridiculod the idea of a young man of English hauteur, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself fond of and much attached to the almighty form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins before him, whilst in his mind he relained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile creature he had formerly known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any means with which she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, after several preliminaries, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to turn at night, as he must regimentarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had elofed, upon any consideration. They desisted from it as the resort of the ladies in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproach, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nOn Monday Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his wards, mocking the belief of those borrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he went out to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of other beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon the sun was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted human race. He at last, weary, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost instantaneous; immediately the sun sets, darkness begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forkling seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly distinguished itself from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to provide shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the noise, for a moment silenk, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman murdering her child; the stifled, exuberant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost urbane second; he was startled: but, roved by the thud which again rolled over his head, he, with a fudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperturbed; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he fell himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell him as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light into the day, disturbed him; he iristantly rose, and, loving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crying of the hanches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entreated that the light of their torches fell upon the mud wall, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more fell upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair canductress surrounded by a lifeless corpse? He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same woman, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attacking as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of someone having opened the vein:–to this the woman pointed, crying, simultaneously filled with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had longly been to him. The object of so many joyful and airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was blanked and seemed to shun refleclion, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciencialy in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar character, which had been found in the hut. They were met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. The lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconstable; both died broken-hearted.\nA young man put to bed was seized with a sudden violent fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some accountable circular he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malediction upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and staggered at the sight of him whose image he had once imagined to be that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentant for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, excitement, and passion which he showed, soon resumed his presence. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared the affable being who had so astonished Aubrey; but then, as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again retired into the more serene state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed directly upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the unfortunate's recovery, Lord Russell was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of their orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless seas;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of any one.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguish him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athons; if he ought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; and if he sought it in, the woods, her right step would appear leading him across the underwood, in quest of the inode of violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded hands, with a meek smile upon her lips. He deluded himself to fly scenes, every feclture which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They trawled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to light these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of iridividuals, whose interest it was to exoite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretentious thieves. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the base of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to run in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Auhrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind a sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus confined by a foe, who with frequent shouts bade them advance, and being expensed to unresistable violence, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in charge of the enemy. Finally they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Russell's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being provided merely to guard the entrance till the prisoner could return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days considerable agitation ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty feet. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaware of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye fixed upon Avrey, who was earnestly asking for his assistance with more than mere earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"HARD?\" Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but a little time–my life goes apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal what you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's courts–and is my death was unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raling himself with exuberant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all the nature senses, swear that, for one year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my illness or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whalever you may see. His eyes seemed bulging from their sockets: \"I swear!\" [SUBJECT OF ACCIDENT.]\nHe sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but could not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man roused him, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible clashing him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left his corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the premises of a neighbouring mill, according to the promise they had given his lordship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the window, he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they had searched out the chest on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burjed the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWary of a circumstance in which he had met with such terrible missortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Sinyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the destruction of the victim. There were several dogs and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining some curious forms, which was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discouered in the fat al hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror could scarcely be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the peculiar form, the same varying tints, the haft and sheath were alike in splendour and weight, and left no room for doubt; there were a few drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, to Rome, his first inquiries were concerned the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Hearts. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed opposed to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he afterwards to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantine caresses, he had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exudes from the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul concomious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a fly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smil of joy; but when her brother called to her affection, he would in her presence forget those horrors. She knew from his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet presented to the world, it having been thought by her friends more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the Continent, which he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, concluded that the evening drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the residence of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel any pity about the frivolities of fashionableness strangers, when he himself had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was exorbitant–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened forth. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, sounded in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath.\" He had scarcely made a turn, fearful of seeing the spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed at his limbs almost reflexively to cover their wounds.\nWhen he was unable to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himelf into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Rulhven looked before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He repeated himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his mind had ceased up the mountain his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concealing Lord Ruthven, the name sprang upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining insolation. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a reception, and there gave himself up to his habit of devouring women. Perceiving, at last, that they were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apperently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move away, turned round, and described to him some features he abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, pulled her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again preoccupied upon his thought. Her sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His act startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his life, amidst all that he held dear, and not avert its progress? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to save the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to submit nature. At last, no longer capable of maintaining stillness and solitude, he left his house, roomed from street to street, anxious to forget that image which haunted him. His dress became ruffled, and he wandered, as exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognised; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for her safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuer swifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a daughter amongst them, of whose presence they were uncanscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in view of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which afsected him so strongly. When, however, resistance proved unavailing, the guardians thought it proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the trust which had been before imposed upon them by Avrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injurics and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined in his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glacial lustre; the only sign of affection and affection remaining displayed upon the entry of his sister; when he would smile, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, do nol go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he reserred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Once again he sank into a state, when not even she could rescue him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would strike upon his fingers a definite number, and then stop.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to confer with his physician upon the melancholy occurrence of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Unfortunately Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked indirectly to whom. Glad of this mark of return favour, on which they foared he had been delivered, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently equally capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every appearance; when he suddenly perceived a lock upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her former husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would not wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that witness again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the noise, and thought it was but a return of his disorder, entreated, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to loave him. He fell on his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanitary they imagined had token possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the meeting after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed sane, his expression and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the prisoner and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His life had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with ony being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents; –or fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of God, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he undertook an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physicion and his guardians, attempted to bribe the sheriffs, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, addressing her, and saying she valued her own life, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who had held her in their arms as their hope and the cornerstone of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced them with the most venomous curses. The servants promised they would deliver it, but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard a horror that could more easily be conceived than described, the result of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carrjages bore upon his ear. Aurrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over came their vigour, and they gradually strolled away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless young woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where the bodies were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with grief. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to doy, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was convoyed to hospital. This was not superior to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near occurrence of death. He desired that his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but by the time they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's search had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCIDENT OF LORD BYRDN'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all for him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence was his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Gracious Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1891, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables aways to be had there, induce many British seamen to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track of ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties amply repay the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the races were emplayed in waterlng, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergymen and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a great monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Groek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island some days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him.\" I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I was likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about L250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThe accourit excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—on entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were not simply decorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a large sourmint beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a stone wall bordering a leanng pasture; a large couch or bench completed the furnitvre. In the hall stood half a dozen English chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pair. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed colton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, somewhat, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open. 6ut. We did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseou's works compendium; Volney's Ruins of Empjes; Zimmermori, in the German language; Kopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novellas; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, meagre numbers, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with pencil, in Italic and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and covered with slips of paper, which also bore marks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been returning these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie till his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways a goad.\" I once did him a service; and I have the property of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fifteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black pinnacles and fret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone halustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey corpet, beneath an arrangement of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon which the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking liquors and wines, such as \"clercyma christi,\" eating frittat, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the 1st hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtles bushes, a marble table with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devotional, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what he terined \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mill's base. The sea is clear as glass, and an hourglass, unshadowed by a single cloud, illumines the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty cocksnut and maple trees, several small islands can be distantly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned several young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by woaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testament to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we observed, to have been a very ecclesiastical and berivalent character. One circumstantial we learnt, which our old friend at the court thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we received from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who the rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eocontricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's farne, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Hclrolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, respectfully. It is not quite unintresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or cantributing in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tendernity, syphilis, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his coining the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a boing on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Berridgevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dare to justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must pay a pence, alone may censure the errors of a low-martal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his own free will. To do good in secret, and shun the world's palaver, is the testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving consciences.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "25": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA THIEF.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE sufficiency upon which this library is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a human body could become corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautified. In the West it persisted, with some slight variation, in Hungary, Poland, Austro-Hungary, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly made a crescent out of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these men blood-suokers fattened, and their veins came distended to such a state of repletion, as to allow the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nThe Loridon Journal, of March, 32, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular ease of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Marrsreyga, Hungary. It appears, that upon examination of the commander-in-chief and representatives of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a colonel Hiscock, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with its blood. This precaution, however, would not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been threatened by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, toak up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Problems having been thus obtained, they resorted to their accustomed robbery. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This day, they cut off his head, hurned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in the future, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre bocomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis moristrouf rodomontade is hero related, because it seems better adapted to illustrating the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be considered. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some evil offence committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his nightly visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBut first on earth, a Vampyre sent. Thy corse must from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the sacred place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the slream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living creatures, The victors, when they yet expire, Shall know the dejection for their sire; As cursing thoe, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the stem. No one to blame for thy crime must fall, The yungest, best beloved of all, Shall not be charged with a lesser's name! That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet you must do thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spork, and the last glacial glace must view which snow falls on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses from her long, dark hair, of which, in life a lock when born Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is bound away by the memory of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bleeding lip; Then stalking to thy secret grave, Go, and with Gouls and Frils rave, Till these in horror shririk away from you more accursed than you.\nMr. Soulhey has introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she loved whilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being expressed throughout the whole of the tale as a peculiar type of purity and jinnocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, of which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Metcmet, in his real work upon this subject, besides a great number of anecdotos, and traditionary narratives illusrative of its occurrence, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and interesting details on this singularly peculiar phenomenon might be added; though the present may suffice for the limit of a note, not necessary devoted to explanation, which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are severa others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nableman, more remarkable for his singularities, than for his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and strike fear into those hearts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the discoloured grey cloak, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to point backwards to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a weight that weighed upon the skin it could not penetrate. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the doodly hue of his face, which never went a warmer tint, whether from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beauliful, many of the female hangers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:–though in truth, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common address could not influence even the guiness of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that they even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domicile virtues, as among those who profess it by their vice.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortitude, while they relinquished the more important charge of his regiment to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feigning of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed himself to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was created by Providence merely for the picturesque fect of the scene, as we see in portraits: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothing, which were not as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various ooloured patches. He knew, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, in any mother supported him, striving which would describe with least truth their languishing or ramping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightoning countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merits. Attaché as he was to the romance of his salitary books, he was dismayed at finding, that except in some talcum powders and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no use in real life for any of that congeries of pleasurable pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was almost to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have described, crossed him in his care.\nHe watched him; and experienced the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, accompanied by the avoidance of their contours: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that fed his propensity to extravagant ideas, he transformed his object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so progressed upon his acquaintance, till his presence was always registered. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from thenotes of preparation in Bow-street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some informational reference to this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guards that it was time for him to perfarm the tour, which for many generations has been necessary to enceinte the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if sallen from their senses, whenever scondalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pasantry or praise, clccording to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They communicated, and Aubrey immediately in entreating his lordship to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that although many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the circumstances offered different conclusions from the appearance motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to meet their immediate wants. But Avrey could not avoid marking, that it was not upon the virtuous, according to his duty, to relieve the misfortunes attendant even upon those whom he beslowed with alms; these were scorned from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lord'ship, which was still chiefly impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most miserable misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companions sought for the pleasures of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gombled with sullenness, except where the known sharper was his principal antagonist, and then he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same uncaring face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered a youthful novice, or the luckless fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortuno's will—this apparent abstrudedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with greater fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the family he adored, cursing, in the foltrude of the dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while in any a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his own immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their preferred craving. He said he took no money from the garnishing lady; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degré of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubroy often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign the charade and pleasure which had proved the ruin of all, and didn't tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking honestly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rulhven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke more than his lip; and though Aubry was near the object of his curiosity, he seemed to obtain no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the mourning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoirs of another almost deceased child. Whilst he was thus engaged, five letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter terrified him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an extraordinary power reside not in his own control, these seemed to give support for the belief. His guardians inquired upon his deliberately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more destructive to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to ensure his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsavished virtuosity, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation; in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had now scrupled to expose the whole desmorality of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sufficiently bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invents a plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no unfortunate circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entreated.\nWe entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with respect in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his business in secret; but Hurrey's eye followed him in all his meetings, and soon discovered that an agreement had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very afternoon. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other offices, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of what he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was deferred. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a sepulchration; but did not make any suggestion of his plans being foiled by Aubrey's conduct.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon finding himself at Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monvents which, apparently, as chronicling the deeds of freemen only befrore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering stones or any coloured clothing. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she must have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised house of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think they could look to those who had no houses. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxuriously look of the animal suited her to the tastes of an epicure. The long step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere packet, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the fact that he had just descended upon an old effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his grasp the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. While he drew those scenes on which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future bride, she would stand by, and watch the magical effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then depict to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours as youthful passion, the marriage pomp she remembered watching in her youth; and then, pointing to something that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her eloquence and apparent bellef of what she narrated, excited the interest of Ayre; and often as she told him the tale of the living monster, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the flesh of a little girl, to prolong his existance for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the name of old men who had at once detected one living among themselves, and several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so insensible, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to believe it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his heart was incased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many circumstances which had tended to excite a belief in the supornatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won him over; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habit, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself becoming more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some cliquearian rosearch, he would depart, determined not to return until his abject was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, whilst in his mind heretained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infatuated man he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pausing with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his pursuits, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must inevitably pass through a wood, where no one would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the first heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, irifernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unaltered; he was surprised to observe the melancholy condition of his host, and dismayed to find that his words, stirring the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the pawer of these being first to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his fury, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that during the hour there would be one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, howeer, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and as he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interruption of sound–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate about his feet. Suddenly his head began to look fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the enchanted forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and hrushwood which furrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the lown, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storages. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a laugh, continued in one long, unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, swung open the door of the hut. He did not utter a word: the next, however, guited him. He was evidently unperceived; for, though he called, till the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice exclaimed, \"Again beaten!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by someone whoso strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was listed from his feet and hurled with enormous force upon the ground: his enemy throw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the ceiling, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his position, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The room was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was still heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded every indivual straw with beavy flakos of soot. At the house of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his female conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the woman, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no colour on her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the life that once dwelt there: –on her neck and breast was blood, and upon her back were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had long been to him the object of so many bright and airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. She was soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mothcratch had missed. Their lame appearances, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful event. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they established the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a mast virulent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon God; by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companions to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate remarks upon his head, and regard him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chariced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his dolirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whoso image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost redemption for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite hanged; he no longer appeared that apathetic being that had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious expression playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the prevailing breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he oppeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a master of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; if be sought in the woods, her light step would appear stumbling amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest viola; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter images in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, whom he held so close by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece that he had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They thought much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the reports, which they imagined were only the in vention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretentious dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a force. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for frightfully were the men of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left the room, and, pacing themselves behind rocks, had begun to firc in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering trees of the defile: but alarmed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the sheller of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avrey hastoned to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy means of great reward, Aubrey was induced to accompany his wounded friend to a neighbouring house; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being committed merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promiscuous sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I dread the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you must be my horiour, your friend's horiour. \"How? \"Would you bow? I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but a little help here–I cannot explain the why–but if you would give me all you know of me, my bonour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, striking himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your senses, by all yov nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whotever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" \"Yes,\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; he had many troubles.\nSeveral attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold feeling came over him, as from the presenliment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon reaching, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avrey afterwards apprehended, and taking several of the men, compelled to go and throw it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, although the robbers swore they had picked out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was wildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortune, and in which all apparently seemed to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convoy him to Otranto, and thence to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things here was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–having endeavoured to gain some purchase, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, although peculiarly shaped, the dagger he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tintings, the haft and the heath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Russell's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Avrey's mind was most broken under so much repeated horror; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his entire occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the presence of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his companions, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infaritine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning character which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of the light brilliancy which evidently exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from missorturie, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consoious of a darker realm. Her step was on that light footing, which was not a buttersly or a colourly aract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighorned by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her affection, and could not in her presence forget those horrors she had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes that gazed upon him were then playing in the light of their own native spectacles. She was yet only eight years, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians perfectly fit that her preseritatjon should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the regiment of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashion and stranglers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-rooin had not been held for a long time, and many, who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hasteried thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, whispered in his ear—\"Renounce your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on the spot upon his first entry into society. He struggled with his fists almost resusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven came aground before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, but could not believe it was possible–the dead rife again!–He thought his imagination had conformed up the situation his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again inta socioly; for though he intended to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her undor the protection of a motron, he returned to a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring the girl. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in the most conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her tawards the street: at this door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he succeeded in passing the door, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was at first distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more compulsive was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in consequence that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt change. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was dismayed. His oath startled him. Is it then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his home, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hands to free the world from such a wretch; but his thought, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he spoke no more, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and stillness, he left this house, and rushed from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which surrounded him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was not able to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid himself down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His master, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the fact that he left by his abscence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose parents he were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicous eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affocted him so strangly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, feeling that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that punishment which had been befre imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesperate of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the moral eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attached a gassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining played itself up in the appearance of his sister; then he would suddenly start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–is your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not ever she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aury's being in so awful a situation, knowing his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to go home. Glad of this mark of roturning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was evidently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely voice; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being ever more alive than the feelings of agony. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a peremptory desultory for her success and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at seeing the face of the woman who had so greatly influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus desisted the marriage of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of accusation, he had her swear that she would never wed this monster, unless he— But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice had bade him remember his oath–and turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disease, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubry, desired her to leave him. He fell on his knees to beg, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They attributed this to the insanity they imagined had taken place.\nHe tried to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after in the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he read understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the created earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, although he knew her, his existence, would be worthy of preservation, if it were only that he might first attend to her soothing accerits;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged state,) which was to take place on the last day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, endeavoured to recover the sermons, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he read a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own bonour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, he did not delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any one in the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a man. Night passed with little notice to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparatory. Mornning came, and the sound of carriages banging upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curious behaviour of the servant last evening notwithstanding their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound went out of the room, and in a moment found him again in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the rooom, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remornber your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your father is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, she pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage at finding vent, had broken a hood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not communicated to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom returned to London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near occurrence of cholera. He feared his father's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he resumed composedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had committed the crime of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCIDENT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, accompanied by one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we came into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the excellent supply of meat and vegetables to be had there, induce almost any British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a mile. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the hill, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser trading for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and mysels took a ramble to the place called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the summit of Mount Ida (a small mountain fortified) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Spain with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the differerit islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity vory much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our constable had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor–an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large rhododendron in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two sluffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large scaman's chest in the close: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess are Vollairc's, Schakspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Inspiration; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzehue's novellas; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parmal in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with margin notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading some books the evening before he collapsed, and went to put them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain till he returns; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without his permission, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the whole of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except two pence a week which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage near the road, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greek architecturc,) were considerably higher than the roof. The floor, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong ocharse linen. Most of the houses are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks practice their habits in smoking, drinking strong wines, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two largemouth birches, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and romanum trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a liltle on the left, through a vista of lavender and palm-trees, several small islands were distantly observed, studding the blue water with spots of emerald green. I seldom expressed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic position: none knew his name but Dick, the banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armerian,\" said our conductor, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fellow?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars about the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving those articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. In a circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thougbt proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was once seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-farte, and taught her some of the rudiments of music.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peace house of Mitylenc; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had property of disposition, and all those advantages.\nThere are circumstances which mark peculiar genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling into company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece.\n\"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so excited, is Lord Byron; I met him in my troves on the island of Tenedoſ, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from him; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recuse of Congress in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the ideo of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to what that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in jest to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He had been described as of an unfaithful character.\nEeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or attempting in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The facts are directly the reverse, as can be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his heart. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his caurting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion has set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preeeding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the errors of his forefathers. Lord Byron's character is worthy of emulation. To do good in secret, and with the world's applause, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGentleman, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "26": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE circumstance upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the estitution of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a living body could not corrupt those married in their territory, it gradually acquired, and formed the subject of many well-known stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feoding upon the blood of the young and beautified. In the West it spread, with considerable variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief exists, that vampyres night imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptives; while those human blood-sucker's fangs became distended to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreygo, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a regimentary Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a monster, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the monster's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his habits. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted the doctor Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Poul, at which he is reputed to have crumbled as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, buried his body, and put the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents against others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a monster becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to Illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other form which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only compelled to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most upon earth—thos to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, the Vampyre sent. Thy corse shall rest in its tomb until death; Then violently haunt the sacred place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the stream of life; From the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon of their sire; As cursing thee, thou musting them. The flowers are withered on the stalk. But know that for thy own sake must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy sorrow and mark her death's last gasp–her eye's last spark, and her last glassy glance from a view which freezes her lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow bair, which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now it is torn away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bagging lip; Be stalking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these irredeemable horrors shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has so introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have stemmed from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several extraordinary cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmel, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives of its effects, has put forth some learned dissortations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singular and horrible occurrence may be added; though the present may suffice for the limit of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, which cannot now be concurred by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general application, there are many others synonymous with it, made usc of in various parts of the world: as Vravoccha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, he had appeared at the mostrious parties of the leaders of the city, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon them all around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only increased his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw himself into the breasts where thoughtless assaults occurred. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead gory eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighedupon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited into every house; many wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a stranger's notice, apart from the blurring of rnodesty, and from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and outlinewas beautiful, many of the femole hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inspiration of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood for him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it soemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappeasable impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common advice could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was to do with the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtue, as among those who value it from their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left aloof to him by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they neglected the more important charge of his maintenance and the care of medical subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of nobility and candour, which daily ruins so many inilliners' apprerituations. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that virtue was drawn in by Providence merely by the peculiar aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were more adaptable to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various colour patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entoring into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving whither should deseribo with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by the brightening countenances wen he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when they touched his lips, had led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary pursuits, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presenoo of a ghost, but from want of light, there was no foundalion in real life for any of the composes of pleasing pictures and scripts contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, which gave few other indications of his observation of external objects, was the chief objection to their exiftence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to capture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the object of a romance, and determined to obey the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his acquaintance, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually intimated that Lord Ruthven's offices were occupied, and so found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, the address he was about to rent. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to proceed on the tour, which for some general purpose has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vices towards puttingling themselves on an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or as praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately afterwards mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now found, that, though many more of his actions were expored to his view, the circumstances offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was only upon the voracious, reduced to weakness by the misfortunes attending even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer; but when the profligate came to him for something, not to relieve his wants, but to enable him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the more indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed upon his mind: all those persons upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the scalded, or doomed to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns when they passed, Avrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the cudgels of all fashions; there he entered into all the spirit of the table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and when he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging seance, with which he germinally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encouraged the rash youth of a novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wisb seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sporkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hapless mouse. In every way, he loft the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. He took no money from the gambling table; but immediately last, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certifying degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, arid amidst the various wild and dramatic scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from him than the conviction of finally being able to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily observation upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whom he went to search of the memoranda of another almost deserted country. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with eager excitement; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but agony; the others were from his companions, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residuated in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason to hold the belief. His guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and contended that his character was dreadfully ugly, for that the possossion of irresistible powers of seduction, render his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in diminished character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the principal of his guilt, should be degraded from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, dawn to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fact, that all those females whom he had sought, apparent on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole depravity of the institution to the public gaze.\nAubrey retired from the court, leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and there perceived that his Majesty was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly occupied. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried woman is met with respect in society; he was before obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appainted, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Loosing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abrupty asked him his intentions with respect to Mary, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very evening. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were much as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey relented, and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship on the remainder of their proposed tour, ordered his servant to seek other offices, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of a fact he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the charactor of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Routh next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stops low in Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory up an monuments that apparently, accused of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering sail or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have been the model for a pajnler wisbing to pass on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes fpoke too much red for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle the poor type of her beclown.\nFor who would have exchanged her eye, apparently an eye of an affectionate nature, for that sleepy curious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an animal companion? The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her farm, floating as if were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced lace, in the contemplation of her sylph-like features. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibiting in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his memory the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interrelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why should we describe charms which all feel, but none appreciate?–It was innocence, you know, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling conditions. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to proserve a memorial for his surgical hours, she would stand by, and witness the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the outlines of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plains, would point, to him in the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidenty made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural habits of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the envious morris, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of idle and harrble fancies; but she cited to him the cases of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after some of their near relations and children had been found marked with the marks of the fiend's appearance; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof. Given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to concede it was true. She detailed to him the regular occurrence of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Harriet; her innocence, so controsted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an educated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for same antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that occupied alone the most powerful portion of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always considered to part from him with reluctance; but it was clear that she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her husband was occupied in stealing or destroying every fragment which had yet escaped the destructiv hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with severance, affirmed their belief, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his exoursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to roturn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, which no one would ever reach, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described him as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a fuperior, infernal weapon, the very mention of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was saddened.\nOn Sunday morning Aubrey set out upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the folly of those horrible spirits, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to deport, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was of one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all the fury upon the devoted country. He al last, bowlegged, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twelve o'clock, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, darkness begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its violent thunders had scarce ceased, and an explosion of resounding roars and heavy roars forced their way throvgh the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fog seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Suddenly his horse look fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The engine at last, through great difficulty, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardy lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approched, hoping to persuade some officer to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the suppressed, exultant moekery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which clogged rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found him in utter darkness: the sourdough, however, guided him. He was apparently unporceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in communication with someone, whom he immediately recognised, when a voice cried, \"Agairi basfled!\" He felt himself grappled by an opponent whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with considerable force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and knelt upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now fierce; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those near. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch lusted on every individual straw with heavy flake of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fiancee brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, believing that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he then saw the small form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having apened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, and simultarieously struck her, exclaiming, \"A Vampyre!\" \"Vompyre!\" A crowd was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had always been to him the object of so many joys and fairy tales, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was overwhelmed and seemed to sink into reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engaged in the search of her when a bullet had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parerits of same dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a first violent, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ian; by some unaccountable combative he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever reason, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startedled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, by his kind words, impinging almost repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship had quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed directly upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was almost exclusively engaged in watching the tideless wavings created by the cool morning breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling our world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubry's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once distinguished him seemed to have deserted him for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silerice as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; and when he sought it close to the ruins he had formerly frequented, Antoinette's form stood by his side—if he fought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the verdantwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smirk upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every scene of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had hitherto seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be obtained: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose only interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a regiment. Upon entering, through, a narrow defile, the base of which was the centre of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had cause to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the reply came. Lard Ruthven and Arnold, imitating their comrades, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being surrounded by a fiend, who with insulting shouts bade them advice, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb out and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the hold of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him down on the ground. Aubrey became accustomed to his situation; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown down their arms and surrendered.\nBy promise of great reward, Aubroy soon induced them to take his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence than they being constituted merely to guard the entrance till their employer should return with the promised sum, for which he had given order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortality ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as aware of pain as he had been of the effects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent uneasy, and his eye became fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with his usual earnestness—\"Assist me! Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, my friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but life–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you knew of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were known for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all that your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whomever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and uttered no more.\nAubrey relished to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances atteriding his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he awoke his eyes a coiling shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpso, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and associates, upon his retiring, to the property of a neighbouring man, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to cut it up and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he went to the spot he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the prisoners swore they pointed out the exact rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, and intimated that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a number of circumstances in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten the superficial melancholy that had sezed upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rutbven. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Upon turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the hut—he shuddered—hatching to gather further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may he imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the paralular form, the same varying marks upon the haft and blade were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; here were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to seduce for Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the dissolution of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost overwhelmed with so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the depravity of Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the posts, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; but the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, struggled to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, the memory of the past. If she befare, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still only attached as a companion.\nMiss Avbrey had not that striking grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the love of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some foeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter future. Her step was on that light footing, wither strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and penitent. When alono, her face was no longer brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then paying in the language of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the service, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolities of fashion and strangers, when his mind had been so lorn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to see the smile of royalty, hastened to see it. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice her name, recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, from a little distance, the same spectre which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed down, his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and sorcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were draining from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had cornered up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, therefore.\nHe refused to go again into saciety; for he ought not to know anything concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hurting upon his lips, and he had not succeeded in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a distant relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, that many were coming, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in engaged conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with powerful step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself pushed by the crowd of spectators who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in struggling them, he again heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remain your oath!\" He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became extremely distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's coming again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those torrified her. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he really to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and close his chambers, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that irrelevance which haunts him. His dress was neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any–froin thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Slruck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose character they were unconsciences, he determined to enter again into society, and they watched him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven appraached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his bagging and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward disturbances so visible, that his sister was compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which clung to him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardian thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been foisted upon them by Aubrey's porents.\nDesirous of protecting him from the injuries and suffering he had daily encounter with in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so complete was his mind absorbed by some terrible circumstance. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had come emaciated, his eyes had attained a glasfy lustre; the only sign of affection and recrimination remaining displayed itself upon the enceinte of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that frequently afflicted her, he would command her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him—if your love for me is aught, don't go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incidences became more frequent, and his beard fell off a portion of its length, whilst his guards observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan upon the melancolic circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelligence, of which they feared he had not hitherto disclosed, they inentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in company, Avrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her husband's being once again subject to her feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and appearance as herself; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a frantic expostulation of countenance, he had her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that oath again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought it was but a turn of his disorder, entered.\nBy and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, decided to prosecute him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual bearing no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed him; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how from the serpent's art, or from was the will of fate, that he gained her afflicions. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardian, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the bonour of those now in the grave, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to which he surrendered but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would destroy it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it best not to harass any more the mother of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of crosstabs broke up the night. Aubroy grew more frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigil, and they gradually went away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartinent where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. On the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his companions, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support him; his rage not letting vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the prisoner was accused of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nHenry's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symploms of the near approach of death. He directed his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guariffs endeavoured to apprehend Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disappeored, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Malinci in the island of that name. The forbearance of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and since it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyma, its hounds must repay for the deviation of a lane. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pauper,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not chooso to quit Mitylene, where I am like to get married. He was odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and he resided there about four months, but not constantly; for he \"sings from his cottage very osten to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the manor. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor: an entrance hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained wolls, marble columns on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by means of a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furnishing. In the hall stood half a dozen men.\nThere were two cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were no mantillas, nor a sirigle painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cottori quilts and a pink pillow–the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large servant's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining its contents. On the tablet in the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakespeares's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rules of Engagements; Zimmerman, in the German language; Koczula's Messiah; Kotzebue's Riovels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradje Lost, an Italian edition, produced at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constanciople, much read, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books some time before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing about orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have taken the produce of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house exterrially was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluled marble pillars with black pinnacles and fret-work cornices, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light slone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, known as \"lachryma chrismas,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapevillas, orange and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the fiefdom of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evening and nigh twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"andways attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, surrounded with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smoothed as glass, and almost unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty cypress and palm-lifts, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his bonker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cauld not, but I ain sure ho will riot,\"—\"And cannot you tell, my friend?\" I said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to see the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt something particular of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the royal feast. He gave a cow to one child, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he afterwards gave Groek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to, from all we learned, to have been a very eccentric or benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought prudent not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her husband the use of it.\nSuch was the intensity with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all over the rack, wondering how this rammer in Grace could he. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Follicing in company with Mr. FOSTER, the clerk, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiously concerned, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had never then heard as his name's same, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recited the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Lellan on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unseeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may beplainly gathered from the little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so cleaver deposed in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderriess, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevento has thrown her mantle. Noman could not read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not have a right to give an opinion. Report's are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself must face the awful tribunal where all must appear, and must publicly censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous mind and self-approvirig conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillett, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "27": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidoro\nTHE supertition upon which this tale is based is very general in the East. For the Arabs it oppears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Groek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuly stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West the belief has spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austric, and Lorraine, where the belief established, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who came emaciated, lost their strengh, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers contracted, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the possages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon close examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unequivocally affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain German, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontier of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by cutting some of the earth out of the vampyrc's grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This apprehension, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and trial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants, having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, fresh and foul blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the admitted remedy. A clot was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes in his grave. The following measures were adopted against the horses of those persons who had previously died from violence, lest they should, in the future, become agents of others who committed violence:\nHe received them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person suked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief Justice.\nThis monstrous crime is here relaled, because it is better adapted to jellustrate the subject of the present proceedings than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is regarded as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in custody, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirism, but compelled to confine his infernal vices solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Giàour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corpse shall from its tomb be rent; The ghastly beast shall baunt the still living place, and suck the blood of all the race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living cells, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing the devil, and cursing him, thy flowers are withcred on the stem. But on that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a fat boy's name—The word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance upon a view which freezes on its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest brush was worn– But now is born away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best bloodsport drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Thinking to thy sullen grove, Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror sink away from spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his work a short but beautiful poem of \"Thaloba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She was loved whilst in custody. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being presented to us by the story of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tourtellort gives a long account in his travels of several infamous cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a bararian error.\nMany curious and interesling notices on this sirigularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared to the variuſ parties of the leaders of the ton a noblestan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance not pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin so it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all went to see him, and those who had been accustomed to frequent excilement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female bunters after considerable experience attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some hints of what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his notice:–though in truth, when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were not perceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But if the common interests could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent eaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whother it was that he even overcame the diversity of his sirigular character, or that his admirers were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domiciliary virtues, as among those who sully it by their vice.\nAbout the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lit also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary officers, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so in any milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that happiness was created by Providence merely for the picturesque aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clots, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many men surrounded him, striving which should describe with least description their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters all the same time, by their gracious countenances when he apprached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, they led him into false riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, exposed in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in the books upon which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified fame, he was about to resume his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstances we have now described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him observe the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few more signs of concern of external objects, than of indifference to their existence, impregnated by the avidity of their influence: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the object of his fancy, rather than the person behind him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far progressed upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rutbven's affairs were embarrassed, and so he found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, the place he was about to travel. Desirous of receiving some insolation respecting this singular character, which, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the task, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling voters.\nHilbert Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Russell's character, and now he found that, though many more of his acts were exposcd to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to satisfy their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to jealousy by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he had deposited his alms;–these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to overflowing, riot to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his iniquity, or to sink himself still further in his infirmity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater impartunity of the vicious, which germinally prevails over the reticent bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either condemned to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was noticed at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the benefits of fashionable vice; there he flowed into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but he was always with the same uncharitable face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful delinquent, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his vocation seemed fortune's law—his apparent absoluteness of interest was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the eyes of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he found the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle of friends, crying, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him with them into the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immerse wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy the present craving. Yet he took some money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resume that charity and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich sights of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke loudly from his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he seemed no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which in his cosmic imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernal.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him daily attendee upon the rostrum of an Italian court, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his mind that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his habit, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for he the possess of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his notoriety, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied entertainment, down to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fact, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask aside, and had endeavoured to expose the whole desolately of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let any slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly srequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to enter her room that night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as be supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely shrugged. Aurey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek some other apartments, and calling upon the mathematics of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her condition, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was deferred. Lord Routh next day morely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's inlerposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps towards Greece, and cropping the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then left his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of commemorating the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath some sheltering soil or many coloured stones. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped over the mountain's side, one would have bought the girl a poor description of her beauties; for who would have excused her eye, ap parently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited her to the last wishes of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after artifacts, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole curvature of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the curious gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had written upon an almost effaced tablet, and the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her hair falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly developing hue, it might well excite the forgetfulness of the observer, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of of great importarice to the proper investigation of a passage in Paradise. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfocted by eroding drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew up the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the lines of her natal place; she would describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of her deep memory, the marriage pomp she remembered watching in great fancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every man, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected him living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAvrey began to attach himself more and more to Ionna; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected vivacity of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of passion, won his heart; and while he ridiculated the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still be found himself moreand more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian re-arch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he regarded an object that seemed altogether the rightful proprietor of his goods. He was conscious of his love, and was ever the same frank irrepantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any relatives with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their conviction, with borror at the name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for some hours; when they hoard the name of the place, they all at once cautioned of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproach, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood boil, he was silent.\nOn Friday morning Aubroy set off on his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was appalled to find that his words, mocking the beljef of those horribleness fiends, had inspired them to such terror. As he was about to depart, she came to the side of his bed, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come on, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous explosion, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counsellor. He at last called his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, if almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning feemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly the horse took off, and he was cornered with dreadful rapidity through the entangled brush. The man at once, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that had recently lifted itself up from the mass of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trust him to abtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exuberant mockery of a lugh, continued in one long, unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in communication with someone, whom he immediately seized; but a voice cried, \"Agoin baffled!\" to which a laudable laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his loot as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his spot and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his heart; but the glare of many torches penetrating through the hale that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, which he brook through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual stack with hoavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again plunged into darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of the fair conductress brought in a lifeless state. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a visi on arising from his dislurbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretchered on his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, or even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the wound: to this the prisoner exclaimed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was comforted by the sight of her who had longly been to him the object of many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flow of life that had died wit her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were subsequently met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her wife, whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe the grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the throat. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a sudden virulent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from what can only motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constable. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of the woman whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their scarreation, and still more by the attentions, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed scarcely changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic boing who had so astonished Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey received no different from the former man, except that at time he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last slage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of those arches, circling, like our own, the movable sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of cllr.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elanicity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a louer of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthvon; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly fretted, Anthea's form would be by his side—if he searched in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly sceries, every feature of which created bitter images in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet visited. They travelled in very direclion, and sought every spot to which their collection could be collected: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the fabrication of indigents, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the rising precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun a fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shetering turn of the mine: but being afraid of being thus detained by a foe, who will not bade them advance, and be exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had reached the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. He rushed to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediate thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to carry his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by the prisoners–they being content mere to guard the entrance till their comrade would return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed inevitable with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had seventeen of the attendants about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal what you know of me, my hands were free from violence in the world–and if my teeth were unknocked for some time in England–I—I–but life. It will not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant vialence, \"Swear by all that your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon the floor, and breathed no more.\nAurey retired to rest, but did not sleep; any circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his acquaintance a cold shivering came over him, as if from the prospect of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and comrades, upon his reliring, to the property of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey became distressed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it up to the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared evidently conspired to encourage that superstitious megalomania that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamental in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fireplace, but—he shuddered—hastening to get further proof, he touched the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed almost to be bound to the dagger; yet still he refused to disbelieve; but the particular farm, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rame, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victor to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the posts, as if he were struggling to save the life of same one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed almost opposed to his will, soon wafted him to the English seas; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeored to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her intimate caresses, had gained his affections, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more appealing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room attendants. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded assembly. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling of melancholy, that oppeared to indicate a soul coruscous of a darker realm. Her step was not that light fluttering, which strays which a fly or a colaur may attract—it was sedate and penitent. When Mary was married, her face was never brightened by the slightest of joy; but when her husband called to her his affection, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew destroyed his rest, would have exchanged her smile for that of the governor? It seemed as if those eyes on his face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eight years, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thougth by her guards more fit that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the service, when he might be her protege. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was near approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"bawsy scene.\" He would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not take interest in the habits of fashionably strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the event he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and many, who were anxious to bask in the splendour of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a cornfield by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized instantly, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly turned, fearful of seeing a speelre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was compelled to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his brains were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started spinning in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–he roufed himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was dwelling upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the mystery hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devolving thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering an upstairs room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently engaged in conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he required to move, turned round, and revealed to him those habits he most abused. He prang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forced her towards the door: at the door he found himself impedenced by the crowd of servants who were working for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare stop, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey become almost dislracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living presence prossed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this murderer to roam, wreaking ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspensions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own band to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and folitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the evening damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for her safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he must by his absence the whole of his friends, with a daughter amongst them, of whose presence he were unconfconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, excitement which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose.\nThey, however, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the common eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherency became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. He would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emociable, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the first sign of affection and recollection having displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seazing her eyes, with looks that frequently afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observe that severa times in the day he would count upon his fingers a great number, and then smirk.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to communicate with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's boing in so awsul a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glaring of the mark of retuming intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them all more by his expressing his intention to be presont at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again incapable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished from rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the man who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it with his foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her to her former husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and going on her with a frantic expression of concern, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, or he would– But he could not advance–curious as is that voice which had bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicjan, who had heard the quarrel, and though this was but a return of ill-order, entered, and finding him from Miss Aubry, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanley they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one present. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attentions, and the pretence of great affection for the brook and interest in his affairs, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Whose could resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the whole earth, save with her to whom he attached himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his affection, had begun to soem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soolhing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he desired her affeotions. The title of the elder branch being extremely valuable to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of his brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who he was lest by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, compelling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the gravo, who had held her in their arms and the hope of their houses, to delay for a few months that marriage, on which he denounced the most evil customs. The servants promised they would deliver it to the physician, but he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the husky inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last averted their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, seething with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roughed by the old man, had come in search of him. Avrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a window-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, and the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader had perused—he died immediately after.\nThe guardians endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's generosity had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of residence, and Pravidence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The bounties of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and meritoriousmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a course. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were engaged in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to a place called Homer's Scrub and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) we met with and engaged a young man as our guide, who said he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island some days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit London, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The capacious over the bill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcr, six hundred zeros for it, (in L25s, English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen years, though not constantly; for he soils in his garden very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the million. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a largo myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain basin, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chajrs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single window. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we found a marble chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the dock: it was operable, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rovsfeu's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermon, in the German language; Klopslock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schjeller's Songs of the Romans; Monson's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek newspapers at Constantinople, much torn. No English book of similar description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Ilalian arid Latin. The Mossiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"Thelord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing against his orders, he would throw me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrlanaple; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was peeling. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the futed marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were consistently higher than the roos. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of very coarse linen. Most of the houses are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the ever-changing breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and melons were clumping together on the borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble table with an ornamented wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and lalking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our chapel five days a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this spot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich avenues led the eye to Mount Calclo, crowded with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestio decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woodlands near the mountaineer's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an hourglass unshadowed by a single eye, terminates the view in front; and below, through a vista of lofty crescent arid palm-trees, several small islands could distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this particular suite: none knew him but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon He was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and colton and silk to his friends who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and presented some Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and debauched character. One circumstance we knew, which our old friend at the cottage thought prudent not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the defendant was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her herself the use of it.\nSuch was the informality with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations alight on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Grecce could be. He had money it was clear: he had piety of disposition, and all the eccentrics which mark singular genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in compunction with Mr. FOSTER, the archbishop, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" he said, \"about whom you are so excited, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylone.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childcarloe\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Defendant. Did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not to be unimportant, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been greatly damaged. He has been described as of an affectionate disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the greater feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lady's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Terribleness, sympathy, and chority apply to all his actions: and his enjoying the repose of salitude is an additional reason for regard him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and on whose head Benevolence hath brown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be regarded with caution, partly when directed towards man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fallen-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his praise. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the furest testimony of a virluous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.",
    "28": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition on which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has evidently assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek realms; at which time, the idea being prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if married in their territory, it gradually increased, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their gravestones, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres invariably imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who invariably became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died from consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and from the very pores of thoir skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credulous account of a peculiar case of vampyrism, which is supposed to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had borne witness to say that, in Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Russian Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty-one or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that several persons had been deprived of their livelihood by his attack. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having extinguished their fires, searched up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampirism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the admitted remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pclul, at which he is reported to have died out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, buried his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the oarses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is here related, because it seems better adapted to the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Europe it if considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in existence, the deceased was not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to the beings he loved most while upon earth—the ones to whom ho was bound by ties of duty and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gentleman.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse must from its roots be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy creatures; There fro thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet wait until the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims. If they yet expire, shall know the doom for their sire; as cursing thee, thou cursing them, thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall leave thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy heart in shame! Yel, thou must end thy task and mark the cheek's last tinge, the eye's last spark, and the mouth's glassy glarice must vanish, Which freezes all living things blue. Then with unhallowed hand she tore the tresses from her yellow hair, of which, in half a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is stripped away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet will thy own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more acrimonious than they.\nMr. Southey has so introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thrice,\" the vampyrecords of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is reputed as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved while in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purifying innocence. The veracious Tournesort has had a long acquaintance in his travel of some astonishing cases of vampirism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Metcalf, in his great work upon this subject, besides a richness of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illuminative of its effects, has put forth some malicious dissortations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible occurrence will be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily subjected to explication, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyrro is the one in most general application, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoula, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midft of the dissensions attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various meetings of the leaders of the regiment a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth surrounding him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter at the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtless neglect resided. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the cart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin. It could not pass. His pecuniary interests caused him to be summoned to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to a most excited excitement, and now felt the weight of disappointment, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the decently hued hue of his face, which lately gajned a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were still beautiful, many of the female hunters after riotary attempted to win his attentions, and show, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every woman shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:–though invain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled indignation was baffled, and she left the room. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to his virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or whether they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the base of the sex by their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died whil he was yet in childhood. Lured also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed himself to sympathise with the cause, and thought that violence was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of cloths, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's tastes by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many molhers surrounded him, striving which they could describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into their riotions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the lace and wax candles which fluttered, not from the prescence of air, but from want of snuffing, there was no faundation in real life for any of that collection of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his path.\nHe watched him; and the very possibility of forming a judgment of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other marks of his observatian of extemal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by his avoidance of their conduct: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flatter its propensity to extravagant ideas, he regarded this object as the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his passion, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon him that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were involved, and soon found, from the notes of preposition in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Defendant of gaining some iriformation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some preliminary steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves up an equality with the aged, and thus allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when certain scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately communicating his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with any other man, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nSince then, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, thither, many more of his own.\nAlthough the circumstances were analogous to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the appartenances to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the inmates, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aury could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon family, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask for meeting, not to relieve his wants, but to cudgel him to wallow in his lust, or to sink still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the viciours, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one peculiarity about the chority of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably knew that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion went for the centres of all possible vice; that he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betled, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained. But it was always with the same unseeing face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he accompanied the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a small family; the very wish seemed forune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the eyes of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly asfluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the folly that had drawn him into the reacb of this fury; whilst mona a sather sat frantic, under the spoaking look of mutinous children, without a single farthing of his late immaculate wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatch from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this could not be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of outlasting the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which had proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own interests; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and affectionately to him; but, wever, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriage, and under the variably wild and rich conditions of scenery, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of young wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernaturol.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left his daily attondance upon the morning circle of an Italian cantoness, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted locality. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager admiration; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affeclion; while others were from his guardians, the Attraction astonished him; if he had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his position, and urged, that his characler was dreadful and vicious, for that the possession of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his jealousy, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest clash of insamy and degradation: in fine, that all the serials whom he had sought, apprentently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, who was character had not yet shown a single good point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumcisions pass unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and there perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the indiscretion of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is usual that an unmarried woman is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would surely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing his lime, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intents with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his interests were such as he supposed they would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, he almost laughed. Aubroy retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline acccomparishing his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lady, inform her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was preverited. Lord Ruthven next day merely wrote to his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspension of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and crossing the Peripatetic, soon found himself at Athenaeum. He then lodged his belongings in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in trawling the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only against their slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured leaves. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painler wisbing to pour tray and carvass the promised hope of the poor in Mahomet's parodise, except that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the girl a poor type of her beaulies; for who would have exchanged her eye, apporently the eye of an insane naturc, for that sleepy luscious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epiphany. The light step of Miss Beeton accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uncoriscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole body of her form, floating as though were upon the wind, to the eagle gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had decyphered up an indeciphered tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like form. Often would her curls falling, as she flitted about, and being in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importanceto the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a mernorial memory for future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his paint, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling clouds upon the open plain, would paint, to him in the glwing colours of happy memory, the marlage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to matters that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent fear of what she described, aroused the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the lying murderer, who had spent years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a helpless female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected him living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which compelled them, with great and heartbreaking, to confess that it was true. She detailed to him the tradional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, making a plan of antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he obtained an image that seemed alone the right hand posse of his object. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile creature he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but this was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in sketching or uncovincing some frogmen which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeaused to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they, with several present, affirmed her accusation, pale with horror at her very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, ofter the day had elapsed, upon any consent. They described it as the resort of the vain and nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the room; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, inferrial power, the very name of which apparently made their hearts freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had infpired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; but he refused. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the meantime there was one of those spasms which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly burst into a tremendous riot, and pour all their rage up upon the devoted classes. He at last, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in those other climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the storm begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm came abve—its echoing thunders had hardly an interval of rest—a thick heavy cloud forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue socked masses seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly the horse took fright, and ho was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entongled forest. The animal at last, through fury, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the pushing of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreudful shrieks of a woman mingling with the fifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, which continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, used by the thunder which again roled over his head, he, with a great effort, forced open the door of the house. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, till the services continued, and no notice was taken of him. He came himself in contact with someone, whom he immediatly seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands. Up in his throat–when the glore of many torches penetrating thrugh the wood that gave light in the day, disturbed him–he insensibly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in that moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by the crowd howling about. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the batch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the house of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy farm of his fair conduetress bordered in a lifeless corse. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was just a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her face, nor upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her head and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having entered the vein:–to this the men rushed, crying, and simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A riot was quickly formed, and Avrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to the object of so many bright and happy vislons, now filled with the flow of life that had died with her. He know not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to lapse into reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost urically in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the but. They were soon met by diffrent parties which had been engaged in the search of her husband whom a miller had missed. Their lainentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful calastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized wit a most violent sever, and was for some time delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Rutbven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable combination he would beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate remarks upon his head, and curse him as her thief. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever recollection, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him. [SUBJECT OF OBJECTION.] He had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying first repentance for the foult that had caused their separation, and still more by the affection, anxiety, and care which he showed, so reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that similar being who had so infuriated Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious expression playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stag of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless surface;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now feemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had so memorably frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he found it in tbe woods, her light step would appear wandering amid the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; and, suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face, and wounded lips, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter association in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him and his family, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they continually moved from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was toexcite the generalosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglect of the advice of the inhabitants, on several occasions they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a regiment. Upon entering, however, a narrow depression, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock cascading down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several shots. In an instant the guard had loft the m, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering wall of the defile: but on account of being temporarily detained by a foe, who with insulting language bade them advance, and being exposed to continuing slaughter, if any of the robbers should burst in and take them in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rail, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the call or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces approaching him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring castle; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their conduct–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their master could return with the promised sum, for which he had given an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortificotion ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and character had not changed; he seemed as unconscionable of pain as he had been of the offences against him: but towards the close of the last week, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed on Aubroy, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than mere earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as surely as that of the passing day; but you may save my husband, your friend's husband. \"How? [email protected] How? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need not little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would once all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all yur nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart any knowledge of my existence or of my deeds to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he fell laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the marvellous circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he renewed his oath a new shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when the robber met him, and informed him that it wasn't longer there, having been conveyed by his friends and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should not be exposed to the first ray of the sun that rose aftor his death. Aubrey exclaimed, and taking several of the men, decided to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they picked out the identical rock on which they had found the body. For a long time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returried, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had scized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him from Rome to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing sixoral weapons of affliction, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same stylo as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he puzzled–hastening to gain further proof, he found the cap, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further examination–they seemed almost to be glued to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to save from Lord Russell's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he knew afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the prisoners on the postlions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his mistress, all memory of the past. If before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind he communicated. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that of a right footing, which stray where a butterfly or a colour may approach—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew dostrayed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then paying in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the court, it having been thought by her guardians that her present appearance should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefor, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the centre of her enjoyment of the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would rejoice that he had remained in the charge of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which averpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his heart had been torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been annulled as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened hither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, beedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too wel, sounded in his ear—\"Remmber your oath.\" He had hardly courage to look, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attacked him.\nHe placed his notary on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refused to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his hips, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his head. Lord Ruthven again came before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dogger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; far though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining happiness. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he compelled to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, in a hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If once his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the menace of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was then that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath bound him; was he then to allow this murderer to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister has been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already come. Far days he remained in this state; but up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to see that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight gloom. He was no longer to be recognized; and then he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with his father among them, and in whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven opposed with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward slobberings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was being alienated, they thought it high time to resume the trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wars, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take consular care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by this terrible spectacle. His incoberence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. The next he would lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that nearly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, darling, do not to see him! If your love for me is strong, don't go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"Truc! true!\" Once again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his company be came less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, which first his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with the physioian upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attatched; he inquired anxiously to whom. Glad of this assurance of returning intelligence, of which they feared he had been deprived, they conveyed the name of the Earl of M'Donald. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Avrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his preferring his intonation to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently capable of being affected by the appearance of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, fluttering at the thought of her brother's being once again alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so desiring for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly received a locket upon her hand; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so insuenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rutbven was near him but saw no one. In the mean time, the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disease, alarmed, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to leave him for one day. The witness, attributing this to the irisanity he imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rulhven had called the prisoner after him in the drawing-room, and had been refused with every else. When he learned of Aubrey's ill health, he readily assumed himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could scarcely be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companian, and, by constant attentions, and the pretences of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soathing complaints;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, in spite of her brother's deranged state.\nHe was to take possession the very day before his departure from the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the sheriffs, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a moniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Mornig came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where the bodies were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Walking on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in her ear. Reverse your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So scolding, he pushed him towards his attendents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near occurrence of death. He desired that his sister's guardians might be called, and when the mid-ight hour had struck, he related apparently what the roader had perused, and died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the treasury of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence was his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vespers, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the kingdom of Greece. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and since it lies rather out of the way for ships bound for Smyrna, its bounties scarcely repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the tenants, the clerk and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he fails in his duty very often to the different lands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mission. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simple decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tiling one side, a large marble window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the room by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posturc; a large couch or sofa contained the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed eotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which he wore then in a large seaman's cloak in the closet: it was open. We did not consider ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works compilations; Vanney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Kopstook's Messiah; Kolzebue's novellas; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lapst, an Italian edition, printed at Parmal in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these bills were filled with marginal notes, ten with apencil, in Italiari and Lombardy. The Messiah was immediately scribbled over, and marked with sips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading some books before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie upon his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armerian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces wide and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (which is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of very coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wine, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small stream flowed away, grapes, oranges, and limes were clustering about in its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till two o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was which may be described \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Montagne Calcla, surrounded with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an enormous Greckle appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in several cascades, until it was first in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a single clove, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chefnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic soliloude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gives a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these artjoles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and be of course gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which occurred to an old friend at the cottage, we thought proper not to disclose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the uniformation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, conjecturing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philonthropy of disposition, and all those eocentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palerino, where our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Munich.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognizcd the name of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more successful in our researches into the condition, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some special day; but to me that day will never return. I make his statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in particular to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with humor, or participating in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly described in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charty appear to govern all his actions: and his enjoying the repose of solitude is an additional reason forming him as a being on whose hearl Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" with but feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to my loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cautery, particulary when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appeal.\nHe alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and receive the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuoso.\nSuch a kind heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "29": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE supertition upon which his rule is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself among the Greeks under the influence of Christianity; and it has only assuined its present form through the division between the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief extended, the vampyres nightly imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who came emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of internal violence; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their chests contracted to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is slated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Hoyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, and had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with it. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, several persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consigned their horses, took up the body, and saw it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the occustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same precautions were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe truth belies is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous crime is here related, because it seems better suited to illuminate the subject of the present inquiries than any other evidence which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitalions solely to those whom he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corpse shall from its tomb be restored; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed this livid living creature, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall call upon the demon for their salvation; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. Thy flowers are withered on the tree. The one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name. That word shall wrap round you like a cloak of shame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy gaze must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowood hand you must learn the tresses of her hair, of which, in life a long time when shorn Affectian's fondest pledge was worn–but now is borne away by thee Memorial of the memory! Yel with the own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rovc, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey has also indulged in his wild but beautiful description of \"Thalaba,\" the wife of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having roturned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him and best loved whither in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resolutely marked the course of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournée.\nDefort gives a testimonial in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditionary riarratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explication, and which may now be concluded by merely marking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed up at the mirth around him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair had so attracted his attention, that he might not help but look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the defendant's face, did not seem to blink.\nIt seemed, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed so heavily upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their lives capable of engagment their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never lost a watt, whether from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its forbidding outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some semblance of what they inight term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her appalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and infant daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dracula of his sirigular character, or that they were fueled by his apporent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who make the boast of their sex for their domestic vices, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, her parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to him alone by guardians, who thought it their duty mercifully to take care of his fortune, while they relieved the more important charge of his mind to the care of merchant officials, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' approntices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in the service merely for the picturesque esfect of the spectacle, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a life mercifully consisted in the vestiges of clothes, which were not warm, but which were better adapted to the point of view of the eye by the use of irregulars and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of children were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for those reasons, upon entering into the gay circuit, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their lustful or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into further revelations of his talents and his merriment. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the prefence of a ghost, but from want of lighting, there was no foundation in real life for any of the congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his domains, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and observed the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of eternal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the absence of their corpulence: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant imagination, he then formed this object into the hero of his romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, greater than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his acquaintance, that his present was always recognised. He subsequently learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were endangered, and soon found, from the course of preparation in Slreet, the place he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some infarmation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians that it was time for him. The duty, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some ropid steps in the direction of vice towards putting themselves upon equal equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if far from the truth, whenever scandolous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a reward as estranged him, who, apparently, had not been in company with such men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying law. He knew his character, and now he found, that, though many more of his associates were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his action. His companion was prosuse in his generosity; the inmates, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not up to the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the missortunes attending an absence of virtue, that he bestowed his alms; –beese were serit from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the penalate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further. In his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicissitudes, which general call over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one statement about the charity of the Lardship, which was still much impressed upon his mind: Whoever upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were either led to the caffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject miscry. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apperent eagerness with which his company sought for the contours of fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his opponent, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rashyouthful novice, or the luckless scurvy of a nurnerous family; then his peculiar wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was thrown aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the hapless mouse. In every direction, he found the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle headorned, curling, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat sadly, amidst the spoaking looks of mule hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to be even suffient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the greater of any, the last gildor he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but he the result of a certifiable degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that barcy and pleasure which proued the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him an opportunity of spoilt glory.\nHe spoke frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater pleasure from it than the constant excitement of vainly striving to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assuage the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Romo, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, when he went in search of the mother-houses of another almost deserted city. Wilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager excitement; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entertained in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians induced upon his immediate release.\nHe described his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for he the possession of extraordinary powers of seduction, rendered his immoral habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the accused had not originated in spite of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratificatiori, thot his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the deepest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femmes whom he had sought, apparent on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey discharged upon leaving one, who character had not yet shown a single bright point to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him together, purporting, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the education of the daughter of the lady whom he chiefly frequented. In England, it is seldom that an unmarried woman is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on business in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Laying no lime, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthver, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retorted; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was postponed. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a statement; but did not hold any suspicion of his plan having been foiled by Aubrey's jealousy.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monoliths that apparently, ashamed of marking the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour out on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes begged too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pike, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beasts; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for the sleepy luxurious look of the man, suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubry in his search after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious giraffe, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, bow the whole beauly of her body, floating as it wore upon the wind, to the eager glee of him, who forgot the letters he had first decyphered upon an indeciphered tablet, in the contemplation of her silph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, that might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from him the very object he had before considered of vital importarice to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousania. But why attempt to describe charms which all know, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling halls. Whilst he drew those remains from which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magical effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the ceiling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glorious colours of youth and marriage, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her past. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, infuriated the irremovable fury of Aubrey; and often when she told him the tale of the living creature, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest companions, forced every man, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she related to him the names of old men, who, at last discovered one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the creature's appetite; and when she heard him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and, as it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreak, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his interest was increased, by hearing a remarkably accurate description of Lord Rutven; he, however, persisted in promising her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to establish her faith in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begged her to attach him more and more to her; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself more attached to the almost fairy tale before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-varian researches, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentions upon the things around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image which seemed altogether the most fulfilling possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantil being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could spend her favourite hours, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or examining some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several preserit, confirmed their outrage, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remount, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denigrated the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of the representatives, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion visited; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the folly of those horribles, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his bed, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beasts to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day would soon end, and that in the horzon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climes, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted constable. He at last, though, apprehended the horse, deterred from mashing up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates.\nThis, is almost known; immediate after the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall clrid radiale at his very feet. Sudderily his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardy lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelligence of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, till the sounds ceased, no one was seen of him. He found himself in company with some woman, whom he immediately sized; when a voice cried, \"Again basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands up to his throat—wherithe glare of many torches penetrating through the wood that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly sprang up, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatch was decorated on every individual straw with heavy flakos of silk. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was almost in darkness; but what was his horror, when the glow of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeline. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt here: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneous with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A Literal was quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid by the side of his wife, who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now falling in with the flaw of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconscionably in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a others had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, farewell the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe the circumstances would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both deeply-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthc–by some unaccuritabulous combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maladies upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendan. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implied most repentance for the fault which had caused their scarreation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His lordship seemed quite charmed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet him with his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was almost exclusively engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling bracken, or in marking the progresions of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elosticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fended for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Atbons; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form stood by his side; if be sought it in tho woods, her head would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feclture of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Routhven, to whom he held himself responsible by the tremendous care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Groce neither had yet seen. They trovelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but although they thus bounded from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were largely the imagination of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended danger. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the jhabitans, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a large river, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of steam guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, pacing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being temporarily detained by a foe, who with insistent shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb up and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no one heeding the signal or his own peril, was soon surprised by securing the robbers' ranks around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the corridor till their master should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength ropidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleps. His demeanor and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of last evening, his mind became appareritly uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was called to his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may savor me–you may do more than that–I value not my life, I heed the death of my enemies as much as that of the present day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but life–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would disclose all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul resues, by all yur naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or my deeds to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatsoever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I wear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivery came over him, as if from the prospect of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the room in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his return, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey exclaimed, and joining several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered by these circumstances, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a courtry in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized up his mind, he resolued to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for his brother to convey him to Ortrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him in coming to London. Amongst other things there was a case containing several articles of offence, more or less intended to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dogs and ataghanſ. Upon turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a shoathapparently constructed in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gather some further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the varying tints upon the haft and sheath, were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Rulhven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repellent borrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became insensible and silent; and his only occupation remained in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shore; and he hastened to the manslan of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the braces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was much more attaching as a companion.\nMRS. Aubrey had not that remarkable grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that lighthilliancy which ony exists in the heated almosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never locked up by the hardness of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from misfartune, but from some desponding within, which appeared to indicate some being conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may develop—it was sedate and pensive. When she was young, her face was constantly brightened by the smile of her brother; but when her brother breathed out his affection, and would in her presence forget those horrors she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the deceased? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians that her present presentation should be delayed until her husband's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was first approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel intereft about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the event he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had riot been held for a long time, and many, who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven in that very place—he fell him suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognised too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courted.\nHe ran to the window, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot on his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost failing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into a carriage, and was driver home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursling from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadfulness–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, but could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go back into society; for though he endeavoured to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few hours after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, evidently in carnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he perceived to be female, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by a crowd of soldiers who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey came almost dislocated. If before his mind had been occupied with one subjekt, how much more complacent?\nSuch was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again preoccupied upon its thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not oppose its progress? His very sister might have been louched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He though of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remonstrated, had been already met. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streamling with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At lost, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly the image which haunted him. His dress became collected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day fun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuers' watch, and did not return. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he loft by his absense the whole of his friends, with a fury amongst them, of which presence they were unconscious, he decided to come again into society, and watch him closly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, those whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to summon, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it proper to take time to refume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesperate of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had frequently encountered in his travels, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those consequences of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often remain for days, in constant fear of being robbed. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining was played upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would urge her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not toch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would give up his fingers a definite numbness, and smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, beg him to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situatiori, when his sister was getting next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he became anxious.\nHe did not say to whom. Glad of this mark as returning evidence, of which they seared seventeen deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking he was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be prez.\nSent at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and honorable accomplishment; when he suddenly received a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster which had so longinfluenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he sounded as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a most unfriendly expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, far be– But he could not agree–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember her name–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whale, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, however, attested to the insanity they imagined he had taken possession.\nHe changed of his mind, decided to prosecute him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been acquainted with everyone else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed infane, his expression and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had conveyed this information. He hastened to learn of his former companion, and, by constant assistance, and the pretence of great affection for the bride and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents' tongue, or whatever was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he organised an importarit embassy, which served as an excuse for sealing the marriage, (in spite of her husband's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nHenry, when he was left by the prisoner and his guards, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote to a lettor to his sister, complaining that she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms and their hope in the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he imagined, the ravings of a madman. Night passed on without rest to the busy dinette of the house, and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparatian. Morning came, and the sound of chains broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcarne their vigilance, they forcibly stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him, and immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. On the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is ruined.\" Worn are frail!\" So saying, he directed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aurey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had burst a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and groom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desisted his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. LATEST. Ruthven had disappeared, and Anne's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT FOR LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in November 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the plentiful supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the mouth of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for trade with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Gricek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for one (about £25 in Englisb currency,) and has resided there about four months, though not constantly; for he fails in his journey very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our cousin had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the premises. It consisted of four apartments on the grand-floor—an arch-length hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spocious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stainod walks, marble bases on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring sixed in the side of a small brook Venus in a leaning posturo; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty box-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stussed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Glasgow. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, somewhat, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the left tablet of the recess lay Robertson's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousscau's works complete; Volney's Rules of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; M'Ilon's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, produced at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press clt Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written upon a pencil, in Italiari and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which many were remarking.\nThe old man said: \"The defendant had been reading these books the evening before he left, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move on these without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house extemally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty poces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fin-work corrieices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linens. Most of the house-tops are thus surnished, as upon which the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet flowed down, grapes, orangeſ and limes were clustering together on the borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle shoots, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, wriling, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich virgins led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with alive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in almost total decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the magistrate's house. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unsbadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lavender and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctively observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I suppose he enjoyed a cigar more than I did, but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew him but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" replied our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" I said, \"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had no time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had possessed eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at his nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving the articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we learned, to have been a very eccentric and hateful character. One circumstance we know, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the defendant was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and given himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we deported from the peaceable Isle of Messina; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this stranger in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of considerable position, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in campany with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The gentleman,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I last visited him at Milylene.\" We had not then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to that day will not return. I make this statement, believing it not wholly uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unpleasant disposition, opposed to assisting with human misery, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The remainder is largely the truth, as may be plairily gathered from these little anecdolos. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his house. Tenderness, sympathy, and sympathy appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repose of fidelity is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevalentine has thrown her mantle. No man can read the foregoing pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assent a man to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particular when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who endeavours to bring him before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may change the errands of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's companion is worthy of his genius. To do good in society, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and wise consciences.\nTHE END.\nGillick, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "30": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this belief is founded if very strong in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be extinct; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea becoming general, that a Latin body could not corrupt if married in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderfuly stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victors, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumption; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their bodies became distended to such a state of repletion, as to caus the blood to flow from all the pores of their bodies, and even from the very pores on their skins.\nIn the London Jourrial, of March, 1892, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they posilively and unanimously agreed, that, about five years before, a clerk Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been plagued by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his hands. This preeaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, in which four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entire through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have died out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This deed, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted against the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in the future, become agents of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his tummy.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here relaled, because it is better adapted to illuminate the subject of the pretences observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parlours of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous offence committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affection.—A supposition contained in the \"Gael.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre fount, Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Thenghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all by roce; From your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the course of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy evil living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the consequences for their sire; As cursing thee, hacking them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The young lady, best loved of all, shall leave thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap your heart in shame! Yel then must end thy task and mark her cheek with her last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the lost glassy glance must be mustow, which freezes over in a lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand must tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when her affection's fondest fondness was worn, But now is borne away by the Memory of the agony! Yet will not thy own best blood go down drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and wither Gouls and Asrits rave, Till they in horror shrink away from spectre more infamous than they.\nMr. Southey was also introduced in his wild but beauliful poem of \"Tbalcla,\" the vampyre character of the Arobian maid Onoiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this crime cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the court as a complete type of purity and innocence. The celebrated Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a richness of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, was put forward for some learned dissertations, attempting to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nSome curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which must be concluded by merely remonstrating, that though the Vampyre is the one in most general explanation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various ports of the world: as Vroucolacha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noblernan, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He felt that the mirth surrounded him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light lavender of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a loud quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thougthlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain why it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the face so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now feasted the weight of ennui, wore pleasured at having something in their present presence capable of engaging their attentions on. In spite of the dead-white hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of mirth, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and appearance were beautified, many of the female hunters of greater notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and show, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lody Mercer, who had been the object of the admiration of every man shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice: but in vain: when she walked before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was bashed, and she loft the field. But though the common adults could not influence ever the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the male sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to his virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were inspired by his passionate hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who made the boast of their sex from their mouths.\nSuch virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high moral feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' habits. He believed himself to sympathise with virtuosity, and thought that he was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the mifery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of elothes, which were as worm, but which were better adapted to the painler's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, scarank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many others surrounded him, striving whom he should describe with least truth their languishing or romping savouries: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening colours when he approached, and their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false nolions of his talents and his morals. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, however, except in the tallow and wax candles that winked, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of light, that there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasurable pictures and descriptions contained in those vials, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified career, he was unable to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary happening we have above desorbed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entiroly absorbed in him, who gave few other signs of his obsorvation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the manner of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture a very handsome creature that flattered his propensity to entertain extravagant ideas, he formed this object into the hero of a novel, and determined to observe the springspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the care of vice and putling themselves up into an equality with the aged, and riot a little, allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when certain scondalous intrigues are described as the subjects as pleasurable or of peril, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately communicating his intentions to Lord Russell, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with others men, he gladly acknowledged it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nMr. Aubrey had had no application of study of Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the circumstances offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the inmates, the vagabond, and the beggor, received from his hand more than they needed to relieve their immediate wants. Mr. Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was riot upon the unfortunate, reduced to jemmyence by his mistress even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosecutor came to ask something, not to satisfy his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attribuled by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which germinally provails over the retiring habits of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was until more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or condemned to the lowest and the most abominable misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the far table: he betted, and always gambled with suocess, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same constantly changing face, with which he generally wotched the society around: it was riot, however, so when he encamped the rash youth of a new generation, or the luckless father of a numerous families; the very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, crying, in the fitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him with the reach of this fury; whilst many a father sat frantic, amid the speaking looks of his hungry children, without a shred of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to sit.\nIn their present condition. He took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, the ruiner of many, the last gold medal he had just snatched from the convulsing grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain lack of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the rule of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he refused it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and open to him; but ever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his cariage, and amidst the many wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly trying to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a short time lost sight of his companion; he left him in doily attendance upon the royal circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of an otherwise deserted city. Whilst he was thus engagé, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that here was an evil power resident in his companion, the letters seemed to give him scientific reason for the belief. His guard commented upon his immaculately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully dangerous, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his habits most dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the prosecutrix had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to ensure his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be driven from the pinnacle of urbane intellect, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole corruptity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAurey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single right spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry out his plan in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entreated the attention of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him some respects with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intenlions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired, and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this mother he must be discharged.\nUpon accompanying his Lordship in the remand of their proposed tour, he ordered his serjeant to seek some apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his landlord. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's intervention.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monumerits that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many caloured lichen. Under the same roof as him existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no fouls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mourning-man's side, one would have thought. The gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparenlly the eye of anima ted nature, forthal sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often found the unconscious girl, engaged in the purée of a Kasparcy hutterfly, with the whole body of her form, floaling as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an old effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Not only would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could not escape from his mind the mental object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. By attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and arid beauty, affected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballrooms. When first he drew up the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and would use the magic effect of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would describe to him the circling dance up and down the operatic plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her irascibility; and then, turning to subjects which had evaded a greater impression upon her memory, would tell him all the sensational tales of her nurse. Hereafter, her apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years among his friends, and dearest companions, fored every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who at last discovered one living creature themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the marks of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been marked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of the monsters, and his confidence was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernalural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habitué, marrying an educated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost perfect form before him. He would tear himself away at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins before him, whilst in his mind he obtained an image that seemed alone the rightful subject of his thought. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, while her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of fate. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they had, like several present, confirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neccessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, and the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him should he dare to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representation, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very nature of which made their blood sicken, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was disappointed to find that his words, mooking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such horror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, moved towards the borse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost instantaneous; immediately the sun sets, the storm begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunder had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopy of foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at once, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead clover and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment flickered, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a lavagh, continued in one almost unbroken burst; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced himself out of the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the present, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceited; for, though he called, still the sound continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately recognized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh ensued; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from the spot and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up in his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the wood that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instaritly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke into the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now coming; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flak and soot. At the desire of Avrey they searched for her who had addressed him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more bore upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was merely a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and shoulders was a pool of blood, and upon her throat were the marks of someone having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"Vompyre!\" A litter was quickly made, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what the weapon wore–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun recollection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were searched by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the paces of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsice. They were inconsolable; both died brokenhearted.\nAvrey being put to bed was seized with a violent fever, and was often delirious; in the latter hours he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some uncharacteristic compulsion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecisely place medals upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Atheris, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying an apology for the fault which had caused their separation, and also by the attentions, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic man who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence beg to be resumed, he again gradually retired into the same state of inind, and Aubrey received no respect from the former man, except that at times he was compelled to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation paying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Dividing the last stage of the prisoner's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves rippling in the cooing breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movable sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this time, was much woakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had so distinguished him now seemed to have fled from him. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silency as was Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athen; if he thought it on the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; or if he searched in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and weathered hair, and a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every one of which contained such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Glasgow neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a protection could be attached: but although they hastenod from place to place, yet they feemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock cascading down from the neighbouring mountains, they had reason to repent their error; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whirling of bullets close to their heads, and by the sudden report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Ruthless Henry and Aubrey, imitating thoir example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but aware of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb up and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediatly thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to accompany his wounded friend to a neighbouring cottage; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being contracted merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had obtained an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed.\nHe suffered from unconsciences of pain as he had been of the objects aboul him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may love me–you may do more than that–I meek not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the present day; but you may salute my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need him little; my life ebbs apaco–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stajn in the world's mouth–and if my death were unown for some lime in England–I— I–but not now.\" \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exuberant violence, \"Swear by everything your soul reveres, by all your nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk down upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to bed, but did not sleep; the circumstances attending his acquairitance with the woman remained upon his mind, and he know not why. When he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the anticipation of something horribleness awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robher met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnaele of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it would be exposed to the first ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking some of the men, decided to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his ind was bewildered by these circumstances, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terribleness misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholia that had seized upon his mind, ho resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, be occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the defence of the victim. There were several daggers and arrows. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, such was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gather further proof, he found the weapon, and his heart may be imclosed when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to discharge; but the particular form, the same varying tint, upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendor on both sides, and left no room for doubt; here were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerned the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Rutbourn's employ. Her parents were in dislress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under many ropeated horrors; he was convinced that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and filent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeored to him, in the embraces and caresses of his companions, all memory of the past. If before, by her intimate caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching him to her companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which garners the admiration and affection of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the healed atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes.\nNot from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light sooting, which happens where a butterfly or a colour may appear, it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brighlened with the smile of joy; but when her brother breath to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed as if their eyes were then playing the game of their own destructive sphere. She was still only eighteen, and had not been presented to the court, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her preseritation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her husband. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"big scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not take interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the glow of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a doorway by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remoration that the first time he had seen Lord Rutbaven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, whispered in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath.\" He had just gathered his courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracled his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He struggled with his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and flung his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burfling from his mouth. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the devil would rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real—he determined, however, to go again in society; for though he attempted to ask inquiries concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He was a few nights after with his sister to attend the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired in a melancholy mood, and gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apperently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revelled to him those features be most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by several servants who were closing upon their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey became most distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was overwhelmed. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon its breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been tauched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a shame; but death, here communicated, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when housemaid came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of remaining stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that imagination which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was noanger to be recognized; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where his fatigues overcame him. The prisoner, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him, who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and to keep them close, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approclched with intimacy. But when he entered into a society, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. Wherfore, however, remonstrance proved unappealing, the defendants thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wars, and of preventing him from expositing to the general eye those habits of which they considered folly, they engaged a physiologist to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at once so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he remained for five days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had altained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and re-examination remaining dispensed.\nLayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! His love for you is aught, do NOT go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would grasp upon his fingers a definite number, and then forget it.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, beg an audience with his physiologist upon the melancholy circumstantial of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aury's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of his assurance of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed excited, and astonished them still more by declaring his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to so see his sister.\nCRIMINAL COURT. They answered no, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being surrounded by the influence of her lovely features; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more open to her feelings of affection. He went to speak with all his wonted friends, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at holding the features of the monster who had so long influencod his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and lrampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why be thus dismayed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remand his oath–he turned away.\nHe looked round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had seen the whale, and thought this was but the return of his disorder, entered, and finding him from Miss Aubrey, desired him to leave her. He fell on his knees to the in, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the irisanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning meeting in the drawing-room, and had refused to entertain every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his sister companion, and, through constant altendance, and the pretence of real affectation by the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubroy. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dongers and loins to recount–could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem unworthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fact, he knew so well how to bend the serpent's ort, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubry, when he was left by the physician and his gvardjans, attempted to summon the soldiers, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, offending her, as she valued her own happiness, her husband's happiness, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at once overcame their vigilance, and they gradually ran away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speculatively in rage. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if my bride dies on this day, your servant is dishonoured. Worn are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, accused by the old woman, had taken hold of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAvrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he described composedly what the reader has perused–and died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disoppeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the treasury of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we came into the harbour of Mitylene, and the island of that name. The reputation of this place, and the certain supply of eattle and vegetables alwcly to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties generally repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for trade with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an Englishlord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his company. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred shillings for it, (about £50 in current currency,) and has resided there about six months, though not constantly; for he sails his feluccia far to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in proceeding to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of five apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a science closet annexed. They were all densely decorated: plain grey-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain basin, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply bookcase; there wore no mirror, nor a single painting. The bed chamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pil low—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess are Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Valney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzeble's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lovers, an autobiography.\nThe Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1846; several small pampers from the Groek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mossiah was lovingly scrubbed over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The third had been reading these books the evening before he came, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so paralular, that were I to move one thing with my arms, he would frighten up me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did have a sorvice; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house exlemally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work capitals, (as it is customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The floor, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, known as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breezes.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, following us.\nIn the shade of two large myrtles bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental wooden back was placed, on which, we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nighls till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. Lemons, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and vender the shade. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic splendour. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken casades, and it was found in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and anhorizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a canopy of lofty cebnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romanlic solitude. No one knew his name but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our canductor, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, my friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned several young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the royal feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boot from a fisherman wha had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One quarrel we had, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disolve. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the third was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the insolation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this stranger in Greece could be. He had money when he was unfortunate: he had philantropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar characters. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling into company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The gentleman,\" said he, \"about who you are so anxiously afraid, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I am afraid I know him.\"\n\"I found him at Marylebone.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's family, as we had been some years from home; but \"Chichester Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply we regret not having been more curious in our rescarches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in justice to my lord mayor's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to assaciating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The foregoing is directly the truth, as can be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the firier feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendernoss, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose head Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"titles\" without feeling proud of him as a cavalryman. With respect to his loves and pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be recieved with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errands of a mortal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's attention, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "31": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Pollard\nTHE SUPERFITTLE upon which his tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, still extenuating, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the hair of the young and beautified. In the West it spread, with same light variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief established, that bandits invariably imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; while these man-blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the pores of their bodies, and even from the very pores thereof.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassouia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been threatened by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with its blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty-one or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons comparrelled.\nSome complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was read, that four persons had been deprived of their lives by his conduct. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) perfectly free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to their accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pclul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been drowning. When done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The sums were adopted with the consent of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they might, in their ashes, become aggressors upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChichester bailiff.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade is closely related, because it is better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observatories than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is confidered as a sort of punishment after death, for such a heinous crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased is not only compelled to vampyreise, but compelled to confine his annual visitation solely to those being whom he loved most while upon earth—thase to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nFirst on earth, as Vampyre fent, your corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy creatures; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drop the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire. As cursing the devil, thou cursing the church, Thy flowers for with-\nHeered on the stern. But one that for thy crime must foll, The Queen, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a sister's name. That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her eye's last tinge—her eyes's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless body; Then with unblowed hand shall tear the tresses of her hair, of which, in a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was made; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with the best will drip. Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard face; Then slalking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Afrils rave, and take these in your hands away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose. The tormenting him was best endured whilst in existence. But this conduct be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of life, and being presented through the lens of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The gentleman Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several infamous cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of accounts, and traditionary narratives ill-strategative of its occurrence.\nHe has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible suporstition might be added; though the present may suffuse for the limit of a volume, largely devoted to explanations, and which may be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened in the midst of the dissipations attendant on a London winter, when appeared at the dinner parties of the leading ladies of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, but he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those spectators.\nWhere thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain why it occurred: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the body; but fell upon the chest with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the woeful effects of ennui, wore pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In view of the deadly hue of his face, which gradually took a warmer tint, either from the blush of roudesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline still remained beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inspiration of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her morriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:–though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seomed as if they were gazing;–even her unappalled impudence was abused, and she left the field. Although the female adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; yet so was the apparent caution with which he spoke to his voluptuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular antagonists, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of women, he was as among those femmes who form the boast of the sex from their domestic virtues, as are those who sully them by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lyon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an old sifter in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to him by friends, who bought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary officers, he cultivated more intelligence than his judgment. He had, hence, that high reputation.\nThis feeling of honour and candour, which doth ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturative effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a court merely consisted in the vestiges of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, smart, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers pursued him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their eager countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lured him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary lives, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow on a wax candlestick that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from witchcraft, there was no foundation in real life for any of that collection of pleasing pictures and defcriptions contained in those valumes, from which he had formed his study. Firming, however, some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, overtook him in his career.\nHe knew him; and the near impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, induced by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to exciting ideas, he soon forged this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of that sancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Rutbvon's affairs were embarassed, and soon found, among the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, which, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guards that it was time for him to perform the duty, which for many generations has been the necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the right direction towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They communicated, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the dangerous waters.\nMr. Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rochester's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent ones to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remonstrance.\nIt seems, that it was not upon the virtuoso, reduced to indolence by the misfortunes attendant even upon him, that he bestowed his gifts; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask for money, to relieve his wonts, to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which general prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was now more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and at other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion searched for the centres of all fashable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and sometimes gombled with success, excepl where the known sharper was the antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same uncaring indifference, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful vice, or the luckless father of a large family; then his very will seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he must see formerly effeminate youth, torn from the circle of friends, cursing, in the fury of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him within the reach of the fury; whilst a father sat bitterly, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single fling of his late immense wealth, which he could buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of marbles, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resume the charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of him, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for he had always hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater excitement from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time last sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning prayer circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of an almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing not fear but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his cornpanion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his father, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, and that the possession of irresistible power of seduction rendered him more dangerous than any man in society. It had been clear, that his eontempt for the adultress had not originated from admiration of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her vices, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virility, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: and, indeed, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey detained upon leaving one, who character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to ensure no slight circumstantialices pass by unnoticied. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he formerly occupied. In England, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was there fore appointed to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him. He read all his letters, and so discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though boughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intent with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her very soon. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intenlions were sueb as he supposed she would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the management of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other arrangements, and calling upon the mother of the child, infarmed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foilod by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself at Athens. He then fixed his dwelling in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing the faded records of numerous gory vignettes that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves within the sagging soil or many coloured coats. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on an canvass the pramised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke to too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no hope. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped on the mountaineer's side, no one would have thought the gaze of a poorer type of her beaulies; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparcantly the eye of animated nature, or the slecpy luxuriated look of the animal fuited but to the taste of an epicure. The unfortunate girl of Irish descent accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the uneonscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmerc butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the curious gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered on an almighty tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. With her tresses falling, and she flailed around, exhibiting in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excite the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his grasp the very object he had before him. Of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe those habits which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was jolly, youth, on and off, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew from her memories of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand and watch the magic effects of his passion, in tracing the scenes of her past place; she would then describe to him the circling dunes upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful passion, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernalural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, cxcited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living monster, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femme to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible tales; but she cited to him the name of old men who had at last detected one living animal near St. Albans, after several of their near relatives and children had been marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she heard him so irreducible, she begged of him to love her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, had some proof given, which compelled her, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, persisted in persisting her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excile a bellef in the supernal power of Lord Rutherven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with the affected habits of the men among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form befre him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined never to return to her. His object was attained; but he always found it impossible to direct his attention upon the ruins around him, while in the distance he relained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his remains. He was unconscious of his love, and was still the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncavering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructible hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they, like several present, affirmed their outrage, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when the Greeks heard the name of the place, they at once begged of him not to return at night, as he would first necessarily pass through a wood, whero no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgics, and denounced the most heavy spirits as imperiding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infemal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood free, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off on his excursion unattended; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, inocking the belief of these horrible fiends, had infected him with terror. When he went out to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, for night allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so excited in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the meantime there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted country.He at last, bow ever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had ventured far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the copulating foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took off, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangling forest. The animal at last, throvging fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting him to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exuberant mockery of a lugh, continued in one almost unbroken song; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the founds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with another one, who was immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" From which a loud bang sounded, and ho felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as be could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself up upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual foot with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey he searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more fell upon him, to perceive the airy form of his female companion brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his diabolical imagination; but he immediately saw the woman, when he unclosed them, slouched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed at first as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously struck her breast, \"A VARNEY!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was said by the side of her who had longly been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–he was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, or take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular character, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engclosed in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the court, foretold the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they identified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of his master companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and commenced his investigation. When the latter recouered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vulture; but Lord Rulham remained.\nBy his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attentive, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apothetic boing who had so astonished Aury; but as soon as his convalescence appeared to be rapid, he again graduated.\nHe subsequently retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engrossed in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breezes, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eye of all.\nAvrey's mind, by this shock, was much wakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so delighted him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; if be sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to remember all scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a return could be made: but when they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard reports of robberies, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose object it was to exeite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the informants, on occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the company engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of birds.\nThey were close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant.\nSome of their guards had followed them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their comrades, retired for a moment behind the shellering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a man, who with insulting shouts bade them adieu, and being exposed to unnecessary violence, if any of the robbers should come along and take them in the car, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the sheeter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by feeling the robbers' arms round him–his fellows having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbour; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrails till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seeing advancing with hasty strokes. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the occurrences about him: but towards the end of the evening, his mind came apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer him assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of my passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me haw? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I can at once exploit the whole–but if you would give me all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and my deeds were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but not now.\" \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your natures fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sprang laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a shuddering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the house in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinna-\nThe neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had made with his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached the summit, he found no trace of either the corpse or the elothes, though the robers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to heighten that superslitalious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself arranging some effects he had wil be belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things here was a case containing several weapons of offence, some of which ought to be used to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curlous forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the one discovered in the fire-house? Hastening to gain further proof, he found the weopon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to hold no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet he wished to believe; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on one hand.\nHe left Smyrno, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempled to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and nothing had been heard of them since the departure of his lordship. Aubry's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became lost and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the pace of the procession, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her jovial caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attractive as a companion.\nMiss Aubroy had not that winning grace which charms the gaiety and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light melancholy which often exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some foeing within, that appeared to incline a soul concomious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that lazy footing, which might stray where a butterfly or a colour may attend—it was sedate and pensive. When she married, her face was scarcely brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her present condition forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then lying in the light of their own native spectre. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet presented to the court, it having been thought by her friends more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the service, who might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into \"boyhood.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of mere strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his master. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to ask in the smile of royalty, hastened to her. Avrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lard Ruthven was in that same place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, sounded in his ear—\"Remembrance your oath.\" He had hardly dared to turn, fearful of seeing a speckle which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice in such a spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a soldier, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his hair were falling from his head. Lord Ruthen had again besore him–circumstance started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roufed him up, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his acquaintance had conjured up the image his mind was resounding upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go out into society; for though he attempted to obtain information concerning Lord Ruthven, the question hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near regiment. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused him, and proceeding another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to see, turned round, and revealed to him the features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with one hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he heard that voice close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, reached home.\nAubrey became immediately distracted. If before he had been so absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in this state that she treated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he struggled, the more he was wildcred. His oath troubled him: was he fit to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in his state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and was only when his sister come, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roaming from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sifter, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dusted by him who fled from a prisoner swifter than any—from violence. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his conduct the whole of his friends, with a dozen of them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch them closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all who in Lord Ruthven approached him with intimacy. But when he entered into the room, his baggard and suspicous looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpase, and, fearing that his mind was becoming allenaled, they thought it high time to question again that trust which had been so imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily occasioned in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of which they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His excitement came at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being revived. He had become emaciated, his eyes had obtained a glassy appearance; the only sign of affection of recollection having manifested itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, on her, grasping her hands, with eyes that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, do do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" and again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his comings became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count on his fingers a definite month, and smile.\nThe time had long elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovoly smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flow.\nShe trembled at the thought of her brother's being so alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate himself on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every appearance; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast, and opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus desisted the marriage of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he would riot. But as he seemed as if that oath again could not be remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but the beginning of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubroy, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother into the drawing-room, and had been charged with overyone else. When he heard of Aubroy's ill health, he readily admitted himself to the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasurable could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenience of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, be forcibly won the ear of Miss Augusta. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the known earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell that, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that he might listen to her soathing accents;–in fine, he knew better. He knew how to use the serpents's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling close to him, he obtained an important office, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brothor's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, saying she valued her own happiness, her own husband, and the honour of those now in the grove, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to delay but a few hours the marriage, on which he denunciated them with heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the noise of carriages brake upon his ear. Aubrey became almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last over cam their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving their bodies in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, when one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apse where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immedianeously apprised, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. On the stand, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my word to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, informed by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubroy could not support himself; his rage not leaving vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entreated, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He hoped his sister's gvardians might be called, and when the late hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe constables hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had filled the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vespers, in the year 1812, we put in at the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supposition of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British soldiers to visit it—both men of war and merchants.\nAlthough it lies well out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser barging for company with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble along the cave called Homer's Schol, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met wit and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a prostitute,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not consent to quit Marylene, whom I am likely to get married.\" He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about four years, though not frequently; so he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThat accusation excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in havingtering to the house where the counsellor had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoraled: plain grecn-stained wools, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a large bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an enormous book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed-barner had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common fare throughout Grange. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltajre's, Bakspeare's, Bojleau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Moses; Koczula's novels; Sohilor's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian novel, printed at Paris in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these baoks wore filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading the books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with his orders, he would throw me for a week together; he is absolutely rigid.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who rosides in a small cottage in the wood, and who the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinings and sret-work corrieces, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the houses are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evening in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side of we entered the house, a small steam-boat glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustoring together on its borders, and under the shade of two largescrubbery bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were led, the lord passed many of his evenings till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek ternple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream flowing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was last in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an azure unshadowed by a fingle loud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly obserued, studding the horizon with spols of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries wore fruitless as to the name of the person who had sided in this romantic solitude: none know his name but Dominick, the banker, who had given birth to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"would tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and engaged with them at the royal feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Teatsaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and henevolent character. One circumstance we cannot forget, which occurred at the court, we ought not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a pianoforte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Messina; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who his rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcblect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lord's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcla in this page. Deeply did we regret not having been more diligent in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. Make his statement, believing it not quite unimportant, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandored. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human naturo, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The case is direlly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, soem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or sentiments, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Rports are ever to be received with censure, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares to defend himself before this awful tribunal where all must appear, alone must censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a voracious hearth and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGilllet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "32": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, among the Jews.\nThe practice did not extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt those buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the bodies of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the possages of their bodies, and from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon on examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously confirmed, that, about five years ago, a certifiable young man, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautiori, however, did not preverit him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attentions. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entire free from corruption, and including the mouth, nose, and ears, pure white blood. Procedure having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reputed to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The some measures were adopted with the assistance of those persons who had proviously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their deaths, come agents for those who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by avampyre comes out of himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous crime is here related, because it seems better adapted to illuminate the subject of the present operations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftr death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirism, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—to those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and drink the blood of all the race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drink the milk of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living enemies; Thy victims, though they yet expire, must know the mercy for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best belated of all, may God bless thee with a sister's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet must you end thy life and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glacial glance must view which freezes on her lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the trosses of her yellow bair, of which, as life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is born upon the Memorial of her agony! Yet with thine own best blood ball drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy wretched grave, Go-arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from a spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sullivan.\nThey were also introduced in his wild but beautiful persona of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre corse of the Arabian Majd Oncizcl, who is reputed as having returried from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved while in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented forthright about the whale of the tale as a complete type of purity and goodness. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his considerable work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narrations illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horribleness superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, nocossarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be corolluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general use, there are many other synonyms with it, made use of in different contexts.\nSome parts of the world: as Vrouoolocha, Vardoula, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the disjuncture attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leader of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate in it. Apparently, the laugher of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the subject's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all went to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In view of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of which they might signify affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every woman shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unclenched impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common odour could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was inferior to him: yet such was the apparerit caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wicked tongue; and whether it was that it even came the dread of his singular companion, or that many were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who for the boast of their sex from their domestic practices, as among those who sully it by their vicissitudes.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great parents, who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to him.\nBy guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he exercised more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high Romanlic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many manufacturers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with vice, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a confinement merely consisted in the vestiges of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better identified to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the necessities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, and which they would describe with least truth as having possessing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of those solitary hours, he was startled at riding, that, except in the tallow and wax oandles that flickered, not in the presence of a ghost, but for want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and desires contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, no compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relive his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impudence of forming an idea of the character of a man almost entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the passive assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to capture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon molded this object into the hero of a romance, and endeavoured to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the subjects before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and then found, from the notes of preparation in Stretton, that he was aboul to travel. Desirous of gaining some infarmation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enablage the young to take some rapid step in the direction of vice towards putting them upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as having fallen from the skips, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasoration or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. He confented, and Aubrey immediately declaring his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of respect from him, who, apparently, had been in company with other men, ho gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Ayre had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though any more of his acts were exposed to his view, the results offered different corollaries from the appearance motives to his conduct. His conduct was prosuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate want. But Aury could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosity, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he deposited his alms; these were received from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chority. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more pressing upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a caprice upon it, and they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubry was surprized at the apparent eagerness with which his companions sought for the centros of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except when the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered a rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a small family; then his very wish seemed fortune's will—this apparent abstracted state of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he saw the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the company he adorned, contemplating, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst another a father sat frantic, amid the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immensurable wealth, wherewith to buy food sufficient to satisfy his present craving. Yet he took no notice of the garnishing tablo; he immediately turned, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snalched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledgings, which were not, however, capable of combating the fury of the more experienced. Avrey often wished to reprove this lo his friend, and beg him to resign that company and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but this never occurred. Lord Rutledge in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was constantly the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morriing grounds of an Italian court, whilst he went in search of the memoraries of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, hreathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter admonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was deliberately vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated from hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratificatiion, that the victim, thepartner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urbane virtue, dawn to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtuosity, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposit the whole deformity of their vice to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shawn a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to ensure no slight circumstonces pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he frequently frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of his innuent, though he had bought the girl. Losing patience, he entored the attention of Lord Ruthven, and earnestly asked him his feelings with respect to the lady, infarming him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Rutbven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Avrey retired; and, immediately writing a letter, to say, that from that position he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and colling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concealing her.\nHaving the character of his Lord'ship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day morely sent his serjeant to riotify his consent to separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Naples, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself al Athenaeum. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and immersed himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments which apparently, ashamed of marking the deeds of freemen only before slavery, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltoring soil or many coloured flowers. Under the same roof as himself, existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have furnished the mode for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahoinet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountaineer's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apprentrently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the taste of an epicure. The light of day often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole body of her form, floaling as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just dictated up an almost effaced page, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's rays a delicate sheen. If brilliant and swiftly fading ideas, it might well be to blame the forgetfulness of the author, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballets. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magical effects of his pencil, in tracing the lines of her narrative path; she would then describe to him the graceful dance up and down the open plain, would paint, to him in the glowing colours of youth memory, the marriage procession she remembered viewing in her youth; and then, turning to subjects that had evidenlly made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, exciled the interest even of Aubrey; and often she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed many years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, and forced every year, by feeding on the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run coarse, whilst he attempted to make her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the examples of old men, who at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question its existence, invariably had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the peculiar appearance of these monstrosities, and his horror was increased, by hearing a remarkably accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in convincing her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey beguited himself more and more to love her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he found himself more attached to the first fairy tale before him. He would tear himself away at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. She was unconseious of his love, and was ever the most frank infantile boing he had first known. She always wished to part from him with regret; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whiles her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, confirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Hurrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which would detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necesarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made some of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very power of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised when he arrived.\nHe saw the melancholy face of his host, and was comforted. He found that his words, mocking the belief of those horrid fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of the living beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was an increase of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at once lunted his horse, determined to make up some speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern friends, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thuriders had scarcely passed. During an interval of time, its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate from his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled sorest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to the horses.\nIt was difficult to obtain shelter from the pelling of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment insistent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with one, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agitated!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled.\nHe struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his bands upon his throat when the glare of many torches blinded him.\nThe rays penetrating through the window, which gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as they broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The stock was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was still heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the smoke lingered on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the house of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by his cries; he was again in darkness; but was his bed, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed mind; but he immediately saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his hands. There was no colour upon her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaining as the darkness that dwelt there: upon her neck and chest was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of someone having opened the vein: to which the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was lying by the side of her who had longly been to him the object of so many right and foiry visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was blanked and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vocaney–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been sound in the hut. They were soon met by disinterested parties.\nSome who had been engaged in the search of her said a mother had misfed her. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they established the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were incorruptable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call up upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and Crow regarded him as her destroyer. Lord Rutbaven, chanced at this time to arrive in Athens, and, from whatever reason, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant companion. When the prisoner recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him with the image he had formerly communicated with of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying some repentance for the fault he had caused their displeasure, and even more by the attentions, anxiety, and concern which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship feemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apatetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his canvassing began to be rapid, he gradually reverted into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of indignant exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. DURING the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Routh was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moueless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much wakeried, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of seclusion and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for serenity, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the streets he had formerly frequented, Ianthe's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underbrush, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He directed to fly scenes, every feature of which created such excitement in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They loured in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed exaggerated.\nThese were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as a guard than as a defence. Upon entailing, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a river, with great masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had to repent their negligence; for scarcely was the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullels close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had leaped up, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the reply came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shell firing turn of the defile: but ashamed of being detained by a man, who with insulting shouts had them ad vance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should escape and take them in the rear, they desisted at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contest at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to corral his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their promise–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing in hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparantly agitated, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot expain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my happiness were free from the world's reach–and if my whereabouts were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising his voice with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all yur nature fears, swear that, for one year and a day you will not pass your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may say.\" His eyes seemed bursting out of their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and cried no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with his man rose upon him, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from some presentiment of something terrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been cornered by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinionacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, endeavoured to go on and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, when the robbers swopped out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWealthy of a country in which he had met with many terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy which had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to enfure the death of the accused. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a hand apparently ornamented in the same style as the dog discovered in the fatal hut—he laughed—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined what he saw. He discovered that it filted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying variations upon the haft and blade were alike in splendour on March, and there was no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivo arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and they had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost brained under so many repeated horrors; he was absolutely convinced that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He came morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed contrary to his will, soon wafted him from the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embarrasments and cares of his father, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine acquaintances, had gone into his affairs, but that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblages. There was none of that light nobility which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy melancholy about it which did not seem to arise from infirmity, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a bulterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was constantly brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother spoke to her his affections faded.\nWho would in her presence forget those griefs she knew dostroyed his rest, who would exchange her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as though the eyes of that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only fourteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, who might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entrance into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the srivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not seen so many for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, haftened thither. Aubrey was here with his sister. When he was standing in a doorway by himself, completely unaware of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Russell was in that very place—he felt himself seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, for fear of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same flagellure which had attracted his notice on this spot up until his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were burst from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his head was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few hours after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and ongoing another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appearing-\nWitness was in the best conversational mood; he attempted to pass and go near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and subjected him to those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street. On reaching the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servarits who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, so reached home.\nAubrey became almost abstracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more intensely was it engrossed, now with the certainty of the man's living again?\nSighed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now exhausted, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. Heath startled him; was he not supposed to allow this man to roam, blaspheming upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert his progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became noglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; all night he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His condition, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he had by his own conduct ruined the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose reputation they were uncultivated, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was almost obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to induce him, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alight, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDosirée of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had frequently encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from expasing upon the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physicari to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind obsorbed by one terrible occurrence. His incoherence was at once so great, that he was confined to his chair. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would suddenly start, and, scizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would warn her not to touch him. \"Do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom be referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherances became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a considerable number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of the guardians entering the room, began to consult with the physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantaneously Aubrey's attention was attracted; he looked anxiously to whom. Glad to mark the mark of retrenchment, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubroy seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently now capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; so he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing from the corner of her mouth, her face becoming more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every character; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the feats of a woman who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trompled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked away. But he did not forget her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of counteriance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not make advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the story, and thought this was but a return of bad disorder, intervened, and forcing him to marry Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the meeting after the drawing-room, and had been refused will every one come. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he deeply understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be contained for those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constable attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Avrey. Wha could reward his pawer? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an individuated being having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tel how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, whose purposes weremerely that he might keep her from her enemies;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serperit's art, or whatever was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. With the title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take pace the very day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was seized by the police and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their wife and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few weeks that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The sorvants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any one the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. He passed on without reply to the busy sounds of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be described than described, the notes of busy preparations. Morning came, and he found of carriages hooke up near his ear. Aubrey grew almost fainting. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, and they gradually ran away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself int the apartmen, where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, seething with rage. Whilst on the stair-case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride this day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So soothing, he pushed him towards his assistant, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support her.\nHe threw himself; his rage not letting vent, had broken his blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnised, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nHenry's weakness increosed; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the approaching approach of death. He desired his sister's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader had pervsed–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthon had disappeared, and Avrey's sister had glutted the coffers of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecion Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1212, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of oattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and since it is rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its banks generally repay for the duration of a voyage. We camped, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser barging for cottle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble through the caves called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his castle. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malta, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he had left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominic, the wirie-trador, six hundred shillings for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there almost fourteen months, nearly riotconstantly; and he sailed in his canoe very often to the distant islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old gentleman, who conducted us over the mansions. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grey-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain near the back, which could be made to play with the brims by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze vase in a leaning posture; a leather couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no books.\nNot a single mark, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a thin mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow–the common bed throughout Grange. In the silting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were now in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we didn't think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousscau's works compilations; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradisc Lost, an Italian.\nAn Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much read, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a penknife, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; far he is so particular, that were I to move one lying without orders, he would frown upon us for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of his farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small house in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house altogether was pleasing. The porch in front was fifty paces long and fifteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plint-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grocian architecture,) were considered much higher than the rafters. The roof, surrounded by a large stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of very coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus named, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lacbryma christi,\" eating fruit, and onjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a splendid sail glided away, grapes, orangis and limes were lining together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always at-night.\"\n\"We have our chapel twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Montcalm, covered with olive and myrtles trees blooming, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in melancholy decay. A smelly stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, but it was lost in the woods near the locomotive's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were curiously observed, contrasting the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a job more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic position: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"cannot tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had partioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cricket arid silk to the girls who live in weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstantial we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the pecuniary isle of Meltylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had in everything it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in conversation with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in England and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's same, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the name of Charles in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and doing justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to assisting human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly proved from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have been scat in his bosom. Tendemess, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an important part of marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to my loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Repairs are ever to be required.\nHe received with censure, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and shun the world's attention, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prisoner, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "33": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition with which this tale is told is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Lalin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradual increased, and formed the subject of many wondrous stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of complications; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their chests became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Modreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about ten years before, a certain young man, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a monster, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the monster's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vain person; and, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, several persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of their lives by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants, having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from infection, and emilting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and lungs of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This day, they cut off his head, burned his body, and throw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from consumption, so that they should, in their turn, become agenies upon others who survived them.\nThe universality if, that a person sucked up a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his blood.\nChief bailiffs.\nThis monstrous rodmontade is closely related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftor death, for some heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confirm his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved in person while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse must fall from its tomb and rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drairi the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, Shall knaw the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing him. The flowers are white on the stem. But one thing for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best born of a family, shall bless thee with a other's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must do thy task and meet Her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the locks of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when Mrs. Affectiori's fondest pledge was worn, But now is borne away by the Memorial of the loss of her life! Yet with your own best will drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard face; Be stalking to thy sullen grave, Ga–and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Soutbey was also introduced in his wild but beautiful persona of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre cousin of the Arclinian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. All this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of some astonishing cases of vampyrism, of which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradilionary descriptions illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a scientific, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a time, necessorlly devoted to exploriation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world, such as Vroucolocha, Vordoulacha, Groucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London whirler, there appeared at the dinner parties of the various lodgings of the ton a nobler man, more remarkable for his rigularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not cease to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; it fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to vigorous excitements, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In view of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesly, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after him have attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every man since she had been in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his arms, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:–though invincibly when she stood before him, though his eyes were apperently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her appalled impudence was bidden, and she left the field. But though the prosecutrix could not influence even the guidance of her eyes, it was not that the female fex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent girl, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wicked torigue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dreacity of his character, or that they were moved by his apprentrent hatred of vice, he was as objectionable among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtuos, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Avrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guards, who though their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the ranks of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romanlic feeling of honour and dignity, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with him, and thought that vicc was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he though that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various caloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many ladies surrounded him, speaking which should describe in the least truth their lustrous or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his salitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, embodied in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those books, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was almost to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an opinion of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave no other signs of his observation of external objects, than the total assent to their absence, implied by the avoidance of contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered his disposition to extravagant ideas, he thus formed this object into the hero of a myth, and determined to observe the offspring of his imagination, through the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him alteritions, and so for advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Slreet, that he was out to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take same rapid steps in the career of vice as the aged, by placing them themselves upon an equality with the aged and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the heights, whenever scandalous intrigues are merited as the subjects of pleasanry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey, immediately mentioning his intent to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly adopted it, and in a few days they had passed through the turbulent waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motu proprieties to his conduct. His companion was profusely generous;–the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to satisfy their immediate wants. But Avrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosos, reduced to indigence by the inissuances attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;–some were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to be low in his lust, or to fink himself deeper in his iriquity, he was sent away with charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the intelligent, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigents. There was one circumstance about the charioteer of his Lordship, which was still more impressing upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aury was surprised at the apparent ease with which his company sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entcred into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracledness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the holf-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the throes of a delirium, the fate that had drawn him with them into the reach of this folly; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the unconscionable hand of the innocent: this could not but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, copable against the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it—for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbaven in his carriage, cland amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and though Avrey was the object of much curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the coristant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the oppearance of something supernatural.\nThey then arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companiori; he left him in daily attendance upon the mourning court of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the municipals of another equally deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager excitement; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power referent in his companion, these seem to give him sufficient reason for the lies. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and said his character was dreadfully vicarious, for that the possession of irresistiblity powers of seduction, rendered his lascivious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the prosecutrix had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victor, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their purity, had, since his departure, thrown off the mask aside, and had not consented to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to find some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, promising, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by without being noticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work. Because of the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he frequently frequented. In London, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in company; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the murder of an innocent girl. Losing time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intents with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Rulhven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed a man would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to murder her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven had that day merely sent his servant to signify his complete consent to a separation; but did not hold any fuspicion of his reputation having been soiled by Auhrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps toward Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed up residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the saded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen and before them, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many crowded chambers. Under the same circumstances as him there existed a girl, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on tray the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think they could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced up, The plain, or trippled ground, was the plaintiff's fief. One would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for the sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited not to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the aged gentleman accompanied Avrey in his search after antiquities, and almost invariably would the young girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as she were upon the wind, to the old gaze of the gentleman, who forgot the lettors he had just deciphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, ensconced in the sun's ray of deliously brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excite the jealous feelings of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance in the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all seel, but none appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and innocence, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and nighting balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance up on the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to scenes that had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales told by her nurse. Her carnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempt to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but occasionally she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected her living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and it had been, reinarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreak, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditianal appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutherven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the asfected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision ofromance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself nearer and more attached to the most fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the things around him, which in his mind he retained an image which seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. She was conscious of his illness, and was ever the same wretched infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becaufe she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in sketching or uncovering some mystery which had yet escaped the destructive hand of fate. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyreſ, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed up on one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at once, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever emain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the sort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and described the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproachments, and tried to talk them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal pawer, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy state of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the beaucoup of their horrble fiends, had induced them to such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these charms to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so immersed in his researches, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon. He at once, however, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. There was not one of those specks which, in the warmer climate, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counsellor. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was upon him–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick heavy rain forked its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the furious lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very fect. Sudden his horse took off, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he knew, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which furrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the towri, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the stones. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continuing in an almost unbroken sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which again roared upon his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the dog, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he collided, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud blast succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his adversary threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in consequence of the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, he was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon surrounded by those without. They entered; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again found in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, he could perceive the airy form of his fair companion upon a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision rising from his deluded imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, slouched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a feeling about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having entered the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to be the object of so many bright and sajry visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was blanked and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked hand-drawer of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by other parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the public of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconclusive; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these circumstances he would call upon Lord Ruthven, and up in some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the life he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, meanwhile, happened at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever recollection, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had causied their separation, and even more by the affection, anxiety, and concern which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His appearance seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apothetic being who had so appalled Aubrey; but as soon as his excitement began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile had affected him. During the first stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, over our world, the moveless sun; but now, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had so distinguish him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athons; if he thought it amidst the ruins he had formerly occupied, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought it in wood, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the most violet; and suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crealed such strong associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthen, whom he held himself bound by the tendor care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They hoard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the inventions of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entoring, however, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the wistling of bullets close to their heads, accompanied by the commotion report of several shots. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the latter's example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting tones bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting flaughter, if any of the comrades should come above and look in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shol in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces approaching him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great success.\nAubrey soon induced them to conceal themselves from a neighhouring crowd; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–the latter being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His congenial appearance had not changed; he seemed as uncorrified of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apperently uncasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usuall earnestness—\"Assist me! You may love me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my acquaintance as little as that of the passing day; but you may save your own life, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–if you would conceal me.\" If you know of me, my honour was free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, regaling himself with exultant violenee, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your natures fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you must say.\" His eyes seemed hurting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to bed, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose up in his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and associates, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had made to his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Avrey astonished, and taking some of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered by these circumstances, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appareritly conspired to beighten that superstitious melancholy that had sejzed upon him, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilst waiting for the vessel to carry him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effeccts he had with him belonging to Lard Riva. In other cases there was a case containing several different charges of offence, more or less adopted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atags. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath appareritly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fat al hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further purchase, he found the clasp, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splondour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeat horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He came insensible and silent; and his entire conduct consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the rambling of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embracos and caresses of his sister, his memory of the past. If before, by her infantine carefests, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as affection.\nMiss Auhrey had not that winning grace which gains the admiration and affection of the drawing-room assemblages. There was none of that light brilliancy which evidently exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about him which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soulconscious of a brighter future. Her step was not that lurching footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and passive. When alone, her face was never surrounded by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if through their eyes they were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only eighteen, and had not yet been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her husband's return from the Continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, the forefore, decided that the new drawing-room, which was fast oppressing, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" He would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the millinery which powered him. He could not feel interest in the frivolities of fashionable pursuits, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They then arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced in a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was enormous–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the majesty of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engagled in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arms, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot on his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and flung his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadfularray–the dagger–is oath–He asked him if he could not believe it possible–the dead rise up!–He thought his imagination had conjured it up.\nHe described the image his mind was dwelling upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he endeavoured to ask questions concerning Lord Ruthven, the question remained upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining anyformation. He went a few nights afterwards with his sister to the assembly of a near relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried footstep, forced her towards the street: at the doorway he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurriedly following his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's objections were now unheeded, and it was in consequence that she intreated him to apply to her wife, who had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His outburst startled him; was he then to allow this monstrosity to roar, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all be stillness, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in his state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and came only when his sister or come, wha, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed the length of the street, anxious to fly that image which honoured him. His dress became neglected, and he was as often exposed to the noon sun as to the midnights damps. He was no longer to be recovered; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him to rest wherever folly overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to watch him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled for a pursuer swifter than he could run from thought. His condition, however, suddenly changed. Stricken with the idea that he had by his absence lost the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom probability they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when entreated into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so severely. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought probable to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alleriated, they thought it high time to resume control that had been imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily inflicted in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye the marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeored to not do it, so competently was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy appearance; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes tremble, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afficted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, when not even she could rouse him. This last went on for many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guards observed, that severa times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then miss it.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a state, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantaneously Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intelligence, of which they feared he had been deprived, they montioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking it was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleaded, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his brother was with him. He was evidently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more accustomed to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; peening it, what was his surprise at beholding the feature of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why be thus destrayed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a most forbidding expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would not marry this monster, for he was– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the morning the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and bought that it was but a return of his disorder, entered, and, for saving him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to beg, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had come the morning after the drawing-room, and had refused with no one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood him to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasurc could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained his information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his state, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak as himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save will her to whom he addressed her; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of respect, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; or fine, he knew too well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an import-export embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before her departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the prisoner and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now on the grave, who had held her in their arms as their bride and the bope of their happiness, to delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which ho denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the found of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigour, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the audience when all were nearly assembled. LATEST. Ruthven was the first to receive him: he immediately appraached, and, lifting his arm by clasp, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the stairs, Lord Rutcliffe whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in fear of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not letting vent, had broken a blood-soil, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to her sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was dissolved.\nThe wedding was registered, and the bride and bridegroom left Leeds.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the approaching approach of death. He desired that sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe Germans hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all for him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1892, we stopped in the harbour of Malinelle in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies far out of the way for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties almost repay for the deviation of their voyage. We landed, as usual, at the back of the ship, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ido (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scotland with an English lad, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malta, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for it, (about £250 in current currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different lands.\"\nThis occurrence aroused our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet enclosed. They were all sirnply decorated: panel green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a largemouth window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by maving a spring fixed in the side of a large bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed chamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common fare throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's best in the cloak-room: it was operable, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmern's In the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novel; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several pamphlets from the Greek presences at Constance, much more, but no English books of any description. Most of these books were silled with margarine noles, written with a penknife, in Italian and Latin. The Mess was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and desired to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Constantinople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornice, (as it is now eustomary in Grecian architecture,) were considered much higher than the rooves. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong eoarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"Chrysanthemum christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, orchids and limes were clustering together on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamented wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the deceased passed most of his evenings and mornings till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" replied the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with live and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Grek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as gloss, and almost completely unshadowed by a single cloud, stretched towards the village in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty coconut and palm-lifts, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic salitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeniari,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had accompanied eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave cow to one man, horses to another, and cart ton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had peculiar disposition of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar geniuses. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architECT, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byrori; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had not then been aware of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognizod the recluse of Calclcl in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more diligent in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some future day; but to me that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in jest to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to assisting with business, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasvres. The fact is directly thereverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man should read the preceding pleads \"traits\" without feeling.\nI am proud of him as a countyryman. With regard to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with apprehension, particularly when directed against his moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that august tribunal where all must appear, alone may cure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byrom's conduct if worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and enjoy the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "34": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if burjed in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many well-known stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some light variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that prisoners nightly imbibed a portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speciously died of consumptions; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passageways of their bodies, and even from the pores of their skins.\nThe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a partcular case of ampyrism, which is slated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they unanimously and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had borne witness to say that, at Cossovja, on the territory of the Turkish Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, out twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of being tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the hair, and found it (as is supposed to be required in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the chest and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried as dreadfully as if he had been stabbed. This done, they cut off his head, burned it, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, so that they should, in their tum, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe jury returned a verdict.\nThe general belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThe monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observances than any other instance which could be adduced. In many ports of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for such a heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyriſe, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBut first on earth, Clerkenwell sent. Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy creatures; There be your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must fated thy livid enemies, The victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloud of all, shall be born with a father's name. That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet you must end thy task and mark her death's last glimpse–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes on its lifeless head; Then with unhinged hand shall tear the tresses of her long black hair, of which, in life, was a lock when her former Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away as the Memorial of thine agony! Yel with the best blood shall drip; Thy gnawing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shririk away from spectre more accursed than this.\nMr. Southoy has also introduced in his wild and beauliful poem of \"Thaaba,\" the vampyrecourse of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she had loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have result from the insincerity of her wife, she being represented throughout the course of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tovarnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astounding cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work up on the subject, besides a variety of anecdotal, and traditionary narratives illuftrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbararian error.\nMany documentaries and intemperate notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be compiled; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made us of in various parts of the world: such as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissensions attendant on a London winler, the deceased appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as though he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who regarded the sight with a sense of awe, could not explain whence it appeared: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, flinging upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to point downwards to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the check with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; many wished to fee him, and those who had been accustomed to violence, and now felt the weight of melancholy, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of aging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which scarcely gairied a warmer tint, either from a blush of modesty, or from the strong emolion of passlon, though his form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every lady shewn in drawing-rooms since her arrival, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his notice:—though in fact, when she stood before him, and though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But since the common adultress could not induce even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he addressed to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed letters to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and what was that it even overeame the dread of his singular character, that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as infamous among those femoles who form the boast of their sex from their domestic habits, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important cargo of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, the highest romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprenticeship. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by necessity merely for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the reallties of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least regret their languishing or romping favouritcs: but all at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the torch and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no support in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified career, he was about to relish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit indifference to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his passion, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced up his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's friends were embarrassed, and soon found, from the noise of preparation in High Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guard, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice, by putting them themselves up to an equality with their elders, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, wherher scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjecs of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of respect from him, who, appareritly, had not much in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of ascertaining Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, although many more of his actions were exposed in his view, the results offered different conclusions from the applicatory motives of his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the difficulties attendant even upon virtue, that he beslowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed fancies; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater inportunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring strength of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was much more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestwed, inevitably believed that there was a curse upon it, and they were all either condemned to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonism, and then he lost more than he led; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the crowd. It was not, however, so when he confronted the rash youthful novice, or the luckless fellow of a numerous family; the latter his very wish sceamed fortune's law; this apparent obstinateness of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with the half-decensed mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, from the company he adorned, cursing, in the silence of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this end; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; he immediately lost, to the ruiner of rnany, the last gilder he had snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might well be the result of a certain degree of knowedge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his brother, and beg him to renounce that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own interests; but he delayed it; for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke louder than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it. He felt the consternation of finally knowing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nHe soon arrived at Rame, and there for a time last sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his conviction that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. Heif guards insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged him to do so. His character was particularly vicious, for that the possession of irresistable powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous than others.\n-ety. It had been covered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her lover, the partner of his life, should be burled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest depths of infamy and degradation: in consequence, that all those females whom he had sought, apperently on account of their beauty, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon finding one, whose pupil had not yet showered a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no suspicious circumstances pass unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Avrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the murder of an innocent, but thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and on being asked whom he intend to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing to not to say, that from that point he must refrain from accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed to visit, he ordered his servant to search at her apartments, and, calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day sent his servant to notify his consent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, landed himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greck, and immersed himself in tracing the faded relict of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before saves, had hidden themselves beneath the shellering soil or many coloured lies. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and deceased, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to place on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's fringe, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have excused her eye, apparently the eye of animatronic nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited her to the taste of an epicure. The lively step of the osten accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as if were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effaced trunk, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well illustrate the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but no one can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unasfected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his penance, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the carnival dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and affection for what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the lying vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and deceased every year, by seeding upon the life of a lovely girl a lovely secret to prolong his existence for the indefinite months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giving them, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey seemed to attach him more and more to her; her irinocence, contrasted with all the abstracted virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he disparaged the idea of a young man of Englisb habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-vulgar research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentions upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the centre of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same fearful infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to withdraw from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer quarrel with who she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in sketching or uncovering some mystery which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyreſ, and they had, with severance present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to proceed at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy ovils as intending upon him who dared to cross the path. Avrey made light of their reproach, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubry set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the raucous face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible spirits, had inspired such error. When he was about to depart, the woman came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to roturn, since night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his work, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in the warmer climates, rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost instantaneous; immediately the sun sets, night begins: andere he had advanced far, the power of the storm was aboue–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate from his very feet. Suddenly his horse look fright, and he was carried with dreadfulness through the entangled forest. The engine at once, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of the setting sun, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the towri, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thriders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exuberant mockery of a lough, continuod in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a determined effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in confrontation with some one, who in he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as deceased as he could, he slugled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force upon the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his back, had placed his hands up to his throat when the glare of many lorches penetrating through the hole that gave way in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to keep moving, was soon followed by those without. They exploded; the light of the flaming tarches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual bed with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubroy they searched for her who had attracted him by her manners; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light from the windows once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless state. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, stretched by his side. There was no colour on her cheek, not even on her lip; yet there was a stench aboul her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that had once been there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A quarrel was quarrelled, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so much jealousy and saisonions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a raked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the carse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a sudden violent fever, and was often delirious; in these disturbances he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Cantwell–by some unclandestine combination he seemed to beg of his former companions to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constable. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whoso image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed somewhat changed; he no longer appeared the apathelic being who had soastonished Aubrey; but as soon as his recovery seemed to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious satisfaction playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Rulbven was apparently engaged in watching the tides and waves raised by the cooling breeze, or following the progress of the large orbs, circling, like our world, the maveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distressed him now seemed to have fled far away. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Routhven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he searched it among the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form would be by his side—if he found it in, the woods, her light would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round. Would how, to his wild imagination, her pale face arid wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to remember all scenes, every one of which created such strong associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the careful care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They trawled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollocation could be attached: but though they thus moved from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the authorities, on occasion they travellcd with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a river, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring provinces, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of gunpowder close to their heads, and by the echoed report of cannon guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avrey, having exhausted their ammunition, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the ditch; but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they decided at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they left the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the cantest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Russell's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being committed merely to guard the entrance till his comrade returned with the promised sum, which he had obtained. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decosed; in two days martyrdom ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty slaps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than mere earnestness—\"Assist me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I moan not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the young man, raising him up with exultant violence, \"Swear by all that your soul reveres, by everything that your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" Sald Aubrey; he sunk laughing up into his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances atending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horribleness awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had found the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that he should not be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that came aftr his doath. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of his men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summil he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was lost in conjectures, but he at last relurned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently confpired to highten the superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whilst waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had upon him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of violence, more or less adapted to occasion the death of the victim. There were several daggers and cudgels. Whilst turning them over, and examining their peculiar forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the woapon, and it may be imagined what he discovered that it filted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certification–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the various tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on both.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rorne, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductress. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Henry's heart became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his entire occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed abedjent to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she, through her husband's care, had strengthened his affections, now that the woman began to appear, he was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room company. There was none of that great brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was red and lit up with the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortunes, but from some feeling within, that appeared to inspire a hope of a brighter future. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a calour may attract—it was sedate and perisive. When she was alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and she could in her mind forget those griefs she knew destroyed his life, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the victor? It seemed as if the eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only seventeen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been decided by her guard-jans that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now resolved that the royal drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry in the \"busy sceno.\" Aubrey would not have remained in the mansion of his father, and fed on the insanity which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and proposed for the next day, which had been described as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room riot been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sifter. While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Rulhven was in that very place—he fell himself sudderily seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardy courage to look, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on his spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to seize the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his brains were hursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the devil–his oath–He repeated himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Loaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recoss, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at once, that many were coming, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in excitement; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him the foatures he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself blocked by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in passing them, he heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remain!\"\nHe did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one thing, how much more completely was it crossed, now that the constriction of the machine's engine had pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unhindered, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain himself to her. What had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath bound him; how could he be then to allaw this morister to rage, swearing upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? He very sifter might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to save the world from suicide; but death, heremembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in his state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At midnight, no longer capable of remaining stillness and soliloude, he left the house, roamed from place to place, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight gloom. He was no stranger to be recognized; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for her safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Stricken with the idea that he had lost by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose protection they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into town, his haggard and suspicious looks were striking, his inward shuddering so viscerally, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, that particular society which had affected him so bitterly. When, however, remonstrance proved unsatisfactory, the guards considered it proper to interpose, and, finding that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it might be time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in these assaults, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye any marks of what they considered folly, they induced a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, as though he was completely absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. For he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a gassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would instruct her not to touch him. \"Dh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom she referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Once again he sank into a stupor, when not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months, but gradually, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his memory threw off a portion of its meaning, whilst his friends observed, that several times in the day he would count on his fingers a defence.\n-check your number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, beg him to communicate with his physician upon the most alarming occurrence of Aubrey being in so awful a state, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and excited them still more by his expressing his readiness to be presont at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of Robert's being once more alive and the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his well-wited warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and extraordinary achievement; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the morister who had so long occupied his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it upon his foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, or he would– But he could not make advance–it seemed as if that voice agajn bad. He turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Auhrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. The friends, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to paeify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused by no one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former employer, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? If tongue had dangers and toils to recount, could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the rodded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were morely that he might listen to her soothing appeals; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her afflicions. The title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse far haftening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the very day before his departure from the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the lives of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the cornerstone of their house, to delay but for a few months that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curse. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the friends of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the noise of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hooke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was unlawfully assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately app-\nHe reached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speculatively with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his fellows, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support him; his rage not subsiding, had broken a blood-uncle, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to her sister, who was not present when she entered, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness grew; the esfusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approaching of death. He desired his sister's guardians to be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related compilatively what the reader has perused–he died instantly after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubry; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nA CONSTANT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to find his place of rest, and whom to be his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Malinocleo in the island of the same name. The buoyly of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies far out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bourities amply compensate for the deviation of their voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble round the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young German guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who had left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not want to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about L250 English currency,) and had resided there about fourteen months, though not consulsantly; for he sails his felucca very often to the different rent islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all uniformly decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tiles on either side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountain outside.\nA spring which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa constituted the furnitvre. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chalrs, and an emply book-café: there were no mirrors, and a single window.\nMONDAY. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble desk, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roufseau's works compilations; Vanney's Ruin of Empires; Zimmermari, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novellas; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, now torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with handwritten notes, written with a pencil, in Ancient and Latin. The Moses was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these hooks the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adriaticople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico infront was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars willhack pinnacles and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a flannel Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of fine coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are now fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were cluttering up logs on its banks, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very dejected, \"and always attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an important Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream flowing from the ruins descended in small cascades, until it was first in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, a banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the towri we learnt some particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cut silk to the girls who live by weaving articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we learned, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstantial we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the informatlon with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who his rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriued al Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Constantinople.\" We had not then heard of his lordship's fain, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mityleno on some future date; but to me that day will never come. I make this statement, believing it not to be uninteresting, and in justie to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slanderod. He has been described as having an unpleasant disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or conlributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is direlly therever, as may be readily gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer seelings of the heart, so elegant and deplored in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympatico, and charity appear to guide all his acts: and his enjoying the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her sea, and on whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantles.\nLONDON. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"trails\" without feeling proud of himself as a gentleman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all men are apportioned, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lard Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and receive the world's applause, is the testimony of a virtuous and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "35": "THE VAMPYRE.\nATALES.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which his tale was founded is very general in the East. Amsterdam. For the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has evidently assumed its present position since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually irreased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and weak. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyrcs generally imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst the vampyrs themselves drank human blood.\n-Suckers fattened, and their velves became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, on March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible count of a peculiar case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hertfordshire. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the regiment, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, ho had been threatened by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty years after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, fresh and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entire through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, who is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same habits were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampirism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked into a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and suks in his turn.\nChief bailiffs.\nThis most unfortunate occurrence is here related, because it seems more adapted to illuminate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a form of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in absence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to make fine infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affection.\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, Thy corse shall from its tomb he rent; Then ghostly haunt this place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet now the banquet-room must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou curfing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one word for thy culpable fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall leave thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap your heart in flame! Yet thou must end this task and mark her cheek's last tinge–hereye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unblowed hand shall tear the trims of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest possession was warned; But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy own grave, Go, and with Gouls and Asrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaha,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grove for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exile. Although she could not be permitted to be justified from the sinfulness of her life, she was represented through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The gentleman Tournefort gives a long description from his travels of several astringent cases of uampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Clements, in his great work upon the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradtionary reflections illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned criticisms, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and intereshing notices on this singularly horribilizing superstition might be compiled; though the present may suffice for the impression of a not-so-remote phenomenon, curiously devated to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparantly, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where homosexuality reigned. Those who fell this sensation of awe, could not explain when it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, gazing upon the object's face, did not soem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the body; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His notoriety caused him to be summoned to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the welght of ennui, dreaded him having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never seemed a warmer tone, either from the blush of modesty, or from the slumbering emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the scullery hunters after much trial attempled to win his affections, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term asfection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of many ladies shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceited;–even her appalled impuderice was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence him beyond the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was iridifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few times he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moued by his parent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the base of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with on only sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Loft also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of bonour and candour, which had been the ruins of many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence mere for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of the clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for this reason, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favouritcs: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances whon he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lodged him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was dismayed at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuff, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasuring pictures and defcriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Flooding, however, received compensation in his will.\nHaving indulged vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilities of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in science, who gave few outward signs of his observation of extraordinary objects, but gave the tacit assent to their existence, imputed by the avoidance of all contact: allawing his imagination to picture any thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He came acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his preserice was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were involved, and soon discovered, from the notes of preparation in Bow-street, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of gaining some infinclination respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guard, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of plunder or of raise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They conspired, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rotherhithe, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had not been in company with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few minutes they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of knowing Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparenl motives to which he subscribed. His character was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant upon vocation, that he bestowed his alms; these were passed from the door with hardly supprobated sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to satisfy his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vioious, which gonerally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous jury. There was one curious fact about the character of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, absolutely believed that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either condemned to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; indeed, he enflered in the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and almost always succeeded with success, except where the known culprit was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but he was always with the same unchanging foco, with which he generally wated the society around: it was not, however, so when he presented himself as a youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's will—this apprentific abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the most gentlemanly affluent youth, from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn them within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father fathered, amidst the speaking looks of hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. The took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the surprise of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innkeeper: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knavery, which was quite capable of cornbating the cunning of the more experienced. Robert Osborne wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to renounce the charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of him, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and privately to him; however, this never occurred. Lard Ruthven in his career, and among the various wonders and rarities of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he occupied no greater excitement of it than the constant excitement of vainly striving to break that mystery, which to his exultation he seemed to assumc the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at ROME, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoriols of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, three letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the other two were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil person resident in this place, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belf. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adults had not originated in spite of their character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: and, that all those persons whom he had sough, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown him and the mantle aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deforinity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to strike the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him all together, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obligated to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed her in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthveri, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of him being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being requested why he intended to marry her, merely shrugged. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the course of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search other apartments, and calling upon the other of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignaliori was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his fervent to riotify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his intentions having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey followed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded record of ancient glory upon some numents that apparently, ashamed of copying the deeds of freemen only be fore slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or in any coloured lichen. Under the same roof as her, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have been the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she belonged to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the path.\nFrom her side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her becluties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparent the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited to the tastes of on account. The light step of Marianne accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the purgatory of a Kashmero butterfly, show the whole body of her forrn, floating as if they were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Henry, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses, as she flitted around, exhilit in the sun's ray such brilliantly brilliant and swiftly fading hues, that might excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could scarcely comprehend from his mind the very object he had formerly thought of vital importancc to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to descry charrances which all flourish, but none can approciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-raoms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew upon remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his sister, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the curious dance upon the open plain, would pair it to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembored viewing in her infancy; and then, watch him.\nIn regard to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, would tell me all the sensational tales of her nurse. Her earnestness, and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his habits, and carest ties, forced his death last year, by foeding up the life of a lovely female companion, and subsequently becoming extinct for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horribles fantasies; but she read to him the names of old men, who, having at once detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to help her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreak, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidence which had all tended to excite a belief in the supematural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ann; her appearance, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he disparaged the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greck girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, farming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impassible to fix his attention upon the things around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed altogether the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was entirely aware of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She occasionally seemed to part from him with regret; but it was becausc she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied insketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their conviction, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afterwards, Aubrey directed him to proceed upon one of his expeditions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to proceed at night, as he must regimentarily pass through a wood, where no one would ever remain, after the locks had closed, upon their consideration. They described it as the resort of the passions in their nocturnal orgles, and denounced the very heavy evil impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of the representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he made them shudder at his daring thus to call a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood froth, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his companions, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the fury of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with sullen terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the barrow there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted counsellor.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up his speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these and other climatic conditions, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night comes: and before he had advanced far, the powr of the storm was above—it seemed that these thundering thunders had no intention of rest—its thick heaving rain forced its way through the canopying folioge, whil the bursting lightning seemed to fall and radiate al his very feet. Sudderily his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of light, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woinari mingling with the stifled, exultant laughter of a laugh, continuod in one continuous unbroken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the lash which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effrontery, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sound continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately recognised; but a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up an his throat when the glare of many torches penetrating through the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his purse, rushed through the door, and in consequence the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the stove once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress bearing a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed state; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a slillness about her face that seemed almost as alive as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast were spots of blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the magistrate exclaimed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of his wife, who had lately been to him the object of some bright and fairy visions, now lying with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and serene to some reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had dismissed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, surprised the parents of some unfortunate child. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they identified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and painted to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died heartbroken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intemperate moments he would call upon Lard Rulhven and upon Ianthc—by some unaccountable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate murder upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at his time to arrive in Athens, and, from whatever memory, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and came his consuls attend. When the prisoner was recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and staggered at the sight of him whose appearance he had now combined with that of a Vampyr; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxieties, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his punishment. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired in the house of mourning, and Aubrey received no communication from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation pllying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stretch of the invalid's recovery, Lord Rutbven was apparenlly engclosed in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the movers' fun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to assist the most of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had hitherto distinguished him seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and solitude as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; is he sought it amidst the ruins he had farmerly frequented, the's form stood by his side—if he went into the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underbrush, in quest of the madest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wunded throat, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter images in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, yet they seemed not to know what they gazed upon. They heard much of it, but they gradually began to forget the reports, which they imagined were only the inention of indviduals, whose interest it was to excite the jealousy of those whom they defended from violence.\nDangerous dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a river, with large accumulations of rock brought down from the nearby precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the men of the parley engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whislling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of scalding guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had started a fire in the fireplace when the report came. LATEST. Ruthven and Avbrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting words had asked them advice, and being exposed to unresisting violence, if any of the robbers should come above and take them in the rear, they desisted at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Routh received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hoeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the prisoners' faces around him; his guards having, upon Lord Russell being wounded, immediately put up their hands and surrendered.\nBy promises of real reward, Avrey induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbour's cabin; and having agreed upon a rate, he was no more disturbed by their conduct than they were, being content merely to guord the course till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's health rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconsoious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his appearance became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to come to his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the value of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life.I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. –\"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, regaling himself with exultant excitement, \"Swear by all your saints and reveres, by your naturo fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my illness or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bulging from the sockets: \"I wear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to bed, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the conviction of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had found the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his captain, that it should be exposed to the first bright ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astounded, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they had picked out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a career in which ho had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparent circumstances conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon him mind, he resolved to leave Ireland, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to take him to Dtranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the destruction of the victim. There were several dogs and atoghans. Whilst watching the men over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a hand-knife apparcantly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal but—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound by the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the peculiar form, the same varying tints upon the head and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home, to Rome, his first inquiries were concernig the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's custody. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of France. He became morose and melancholy; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as they were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calcutta; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him from the English shores; and he hastened to the house of his sister and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses on his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her lively caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never lit up by the light of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate being conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a buttcrash or a colocur may apply—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother showed to her his affection, and would not in her presence forget her griefs. She knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the victuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, where he might be her protector. It was hoped, therefore, that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his friends, and fed up with the melancholy which powered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the propriety of his master. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a diving-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened to see her. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection of the first time he had seen Lord Rutbven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognised too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he saw, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost failing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again came before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting on. It was impossible that it could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for then he attempted to ask concerning Lord Rulhven, the name having passed on his lips, and he could not secure in positive information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the establishment of a near relation. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a room, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he followed them, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by mourners, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, carried her towards the passage: at the door he found himself blocked by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath.\" He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon came back.\nAubrey was almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by this subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living evil pressed upon him? His sister's admonitions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she urged him to cease to do what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startedled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His younger sister might have been touched by him. But there is no way to break his arm, and disfigure him.\nIf he made these statements, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days she remained in this state; shut in his room, he saw no one, and opened only when his sister came, who, with eyes streoming with tears, pleaded with him, far her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and salitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly away from that which had hounded him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight gloom. He was no longer able to be recovered; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest whereuer fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuor swifter than any one thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconsciences, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with inquiries.\nImmediate intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicioned looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so severely. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians bought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming insane, they thought it advisable to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and suffering he had inflicted in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exhibiting to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible aspect. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recurrence remaining displayed itself upon the appearance of his sister. He would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that seuerely afflicted him, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"Trouble!\" Once again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his irascible habits became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had near elapsed, when, on the last day of August, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a state, when his sister was going next day to be married. Inspector Aubrey's attention was attracted; he clinked oniously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they seared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey regarded him pensively, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her little smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to her feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his well-wited warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly received a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the remains of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus de stroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his countenance, he made her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not assist her–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking aloud. Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a repetition of the disease, enjoined, and forcing him from Miss Avrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attesting to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Avrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was rendered insane, his outrage and pleasure could hardly be contained among those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attending, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an indignant human having no sympathy with those living on the crowded earth, save with her when he addressed her; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serperit's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the older branch belonging at length to him, he occupied an important embassy, which served as an excuse for securing the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take pace the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as he valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of her friends now near the grave, who had held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few days that murder, on which he reserved the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the rauings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the wheels of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grow almost frantic. The curiosity of the serjeant at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an hepless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the opartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not recognised by his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was accused of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired that his guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, be related according to what the reader has perused—he died immediatly after.\nThe guards hastened to apprehend Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE SLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to make his place of rest, and provide his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vespers, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables aways to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships hound to Smyrna, its riches amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining far cattle with the nativos, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Idyll (a small mountain so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with his English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in Florence. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Grange, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Maiden, where I am likely to be married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave John Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zecines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and he resided there out four months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity very much. Then we lost no time in hastening to the house whce our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious set annexed. They were all simply furnished: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a lever fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or seat completed the furniturc. In the hall stood half a dozen Engish cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a merchant seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rouget's works complele; Volney's Rules of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were silled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Lalin. The Mess was literally scrabbled over, and covered with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been counting these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"thc must wait until his return; for he is so particular, that should I move one thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm without the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cabin in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the woman externally was pleasuring. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as is now customary in Grocian architecturc,) were consistently higher than the roof. The floor, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Tertiary carpet, boncath an awning of strong coarse line. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light spirits, such as \"lachrymcle christi,\" eating sruit, and enjoying the evening games.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a splendid scallop bedded away, grapes, oranges and limeſ clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his hours and nights til twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and walking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devaut, \"and always attended church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcutta, covered with oak and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruin descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's peak. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald. I suppose he enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenlan,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned many young girls when he was upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we observed, to have been a very eccentrie and benevolent character. One circumstance we learned, which our old friend at the coltage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shores, and he had bought her a pajama-forte, and taught her the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imagination all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, and all doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiously, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the name of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the time, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slatement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lord ship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as having an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or attempting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in Lord Mayor's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his favouring the repose of soliloude is an important reason for marking him as a being on whom heart Religion hath set her seal, and over which head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling fond of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the orrors of a fellow-mortar. Lord Byron's characler is well aware of his girth. To do so in secret, and shun the world's attention, is the true testimony of a virtuous heart and an impartial conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "36": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Powell\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it had only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wondorful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst the men blood-sucker's fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and out of the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1892, is a curious, and, of course, curious account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been lormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the disease, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and bathing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a menace to himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, several persons complained of having been threatened by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attentions. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of melancholia) fresh, and altogether free of corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and eyes, pure and florid blood. The roof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stoker was driven in.\nHe then through the hearth arid body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as if he had been murdered. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The measures were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon other persons who suffered the disease.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous crime-scene is here relapsed.\n-Because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observances than any other instance which would be adduced. In some parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment of death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to commit his infernal visits solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affections.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Glamour.\"\nBut here on earth, as Vampyre sent, the corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the whole place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from your daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which you perforce must feed thy livid living creatures; By victims, when they yet expire, shall call the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the tree. The one that for thy crime must forgive, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name—That word shall wrap thy hoart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's light tinge–her eye's light spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then her unhallowed hand shall touch the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life, when shorn Affection's fondest plea was worn– But now is borne away by the Memorial of the agony! Yot with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Goils and Afrits rave, Til they watch in horror shrink back from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his collection a wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre ere of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him the best lounged in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the literature of the land as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tremort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned criticisms, tending to prove it to be a scientific, as well as barbarian error.\nMariy curious and interesting reflections on this singularly horrible occurrence must be added; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the Vampyre is the one in most general application, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYR E.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon the London winter, there appeared at the various parts of the city a nableman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gaped up at the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those hearts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixed upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance penetrate through to the inward workings of the heart; but feasted upon the cheek with a leaden ray so weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be inuited to every person; all wished to see him, and those who had formerly accused him to vivacious excitements, and now feigned the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the bush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, when its form and colour wore him down, many of the great hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at once, some mark of what they might term affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the mockery of every woman shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all she could, wearing the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; ever her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But when the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet so was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and how good it was that it even overcame the dracula of his singular character, or whether they were moved by his apparent hotred of vice, he was as much among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virlues, as from those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Avrey, who was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by gvardians, who thought it their duty morely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his maintenance to the hands of mercenary subalterns, be cultivated more his intelligence than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all should sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as was often the case in romances: he thought that the interest of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: and, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least respect their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their braying couritenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false impressions of his talents and his merit. Altached as he was to the romances of his solitary friends, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that category of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanily, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his obsorvotiori of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their cantact: allowing his imagination to picture every situation that slanted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, better than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced up his notice, that his presence was always recognisable. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affair was embarrassed, and soon learned, from the notes of preparation in Baker Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting his singular character, which, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the duty, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some prudent steps away from the career of vice towards pulting themselves up an equalily with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasanry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately making his intents to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of respect from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he glodly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling watchers.\nHitherto, Aubrey had no opportunity of substantiating Lord Ruthven's character, and now be found, that, though many more of his actions were exposited to his view, the results offered different conclusions as to the apparent motivcs to his conduct. His companion was conspicuous in his liberality; the inmates, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the miffortunes attendant even upon an virtue, that he bestowed his alms; they were scouted from the door with hardly any policemen; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wax in his lust, or sink still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with great chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generically prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the venerable indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressing upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that it was a curse upon it, for they were all oilher led to the scaffold, and sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the attention of a fashionable viee; there he entered into all the corners of the faro table: he betted, and always garnished with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonism, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging ardour, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the unfortunate youth novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law.\nHis apparent abstractness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, and from the streets he adored, found, in the solace of a dungeon, the same that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, with not a single farthing of his own immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient food to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gombling toble; but immediately loosed, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the will of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that chority and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it, for each day he hoped his friend would give him an opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, this never occurred. Lord Ruth-\nHe, in his carriage, and amidst various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constancy of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he led him in daily breakfast dance upon the morning of the Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoranda.\nEvidence of another almost deferted city. Whilst he was engaged, four letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the last of which distressed him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the fear. His guardians remarked upon his immaculately dressing friend, and urged, that his companion was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irascible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been concluded, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the partier of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied vocation, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in consequence, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not ceased to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey regretted upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning them together, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let some circumstantial circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the indiscretion of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is interfered with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry out his plans inscrutably; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all directions, and soon discovered that an affair existed.\nLosing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his intention to meet her that very morning. He had a plan appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innkeeper, the thoughtless gentleman. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Mr. Ayres retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying the Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify him of a separation; but did not raise any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peripoli, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Grange, and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon mountains that appeared, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of their formerly slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicatc, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the prornished hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mirid for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she dancod upon the plain, or lumbered along the mountain's slopes, one would have thought the gaze of a pauper type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animaled nature, for that sleepy curious look of the animal sultry, but to the last degree of admiration? The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after irregularities, and often would the unconscionable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her body, floating as it were upon the wind, the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an effaced lace, upon the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If would her tresses falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the folly of the antiquary, who could escape from mind the very object he had before thought of of great importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe things which all feel, but none can appreciate? –He was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those reminiscences of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would describe to him the circling darice upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of her youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, aroused the interest even of Avrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had possed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his exultence for the ensuing months, his heart would race, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, and how they had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appelile; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him. He did not believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their exiftence, always had some proof given, which obliged him, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of them. Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth to her fears, and at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ann, her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wormed his heart; and while he discounted the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan far some antiquarian rearch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attentions upon the ruins round him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful proprietor of his thoughts. He was unconscionable of his wife, and was ever the same frank infantile. [SUBJECT] He had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeaused to her parents on the subject of Vampyreſ, and they both, with several present, informed her of its existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyreſ in their nocturnal orgies, and derisively described the first heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. He made light of their reputations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for he had allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promiscd. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warm climates, so rapidly gather in a tremendous mass, and pour all their fury upon the deviated country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and there he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interruption of sound—and thick hoavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the tangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of the setting sun, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, far a moment silen, allowed him to hear the dreadful fhrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one enormous unbroken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effart, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the wind, buffeted him. He was apparently unperturbed; for, when he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found him himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" To which a laudable laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman; determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain. He was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands up to his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he came through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was scarcely heard by those without. They advanced; the light of their lorches fell upon the mud and all, and the thatch loaded on every individual straggle with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the ugly form of his fair co-ductress brought in a lifeless corpse. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost asattaching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the mermaid pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately seemed to be the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was compelled to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been four years in the making. They were soon met by several persons who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mothor had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the house, forewarned the parents of some dreadful event. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they inquired the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corne. They were inseparable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was scarcely able; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccuritablility combinatiion he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Rulhven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever inspiration, upon hearing of the fate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and staggered at the sight of his wife, whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Routhven, by his kind words, implying a most repentant for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, concern, and care which he lavished upon her. When he showed, she called him to his chambers. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey received no change from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of ralicious expression playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but his smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recouery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, and in marking the progress of those waves, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elasticity of spirit which had once so sustained him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athenſ; if he thought it was in the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; if ho sougbt in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which crealed such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought the very spot to which a revolver could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the opinion of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the jealousy of those who they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a regiment. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the base of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brushing down from the nearby precipitous precipices, they had reason to regret their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bulets close to their heads, accompanied by the echoed report of shots. In an instant their guard had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Russell and Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment behind the shifting turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by their foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to immediate slaughter, if any of the rogers should climb above and take them from the rear, they desisted at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey returned to his office; and, no longer hearing the contours of the fight, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' foces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Russell's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence than before, being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrades should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decrease; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed accelerating with hasty strokes. His demeanor and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconcerned of pain as he had been of the injuries inflicted upon him: but towards the close of the first evening, his mind became apparently vengeful, and his eye fixed upon Aubrey, who was inclined to offer his assistance with more than his usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"HARD?\" Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but life–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot explain the whale–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unnecessary for some lime in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, regaling himself with exultation, \"Swear by all that you soul revere, by all your nature foarf, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my curses or curses to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed to burst from their sockets: \"I swam!\" Sald Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nHenry retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the present knowledge of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of his men, determined to cut it up and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached to the sumptuous spot he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had burjed the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a household in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which events apparently seemed to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and sailed at Smyrna. Whilst waiting for a vessel to convey him to Oranlo, or to Naples, he occupied himself in searching those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Riva. Among other things there was a case containing several weapons of execution, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victor. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same stylus as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further purchase, he found the knife, and horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though curiously shaped, the sheath hoheld in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certairity–they seemed gazing to be upon the dagger; yet still he seemed to deny it; but the particular form, the same varying colours upon the haft and sheath were like in splendour on both, and lest no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were indistinct, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his regiment. Aubroy's heart became almost broken under so many repeated horror; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a brook, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his sister, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and care of his mother, all memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the women began to appear, she was more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was a quality of that brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was constantly lit up by the luminosity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about him which did not seem to derive from melancholy or melancholy, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her foot was not that light footing, which strays where a bulterfly or a colour may enter—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was not brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother expressed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs he knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes were then playing in the light of their own native spectacles. She was yet only fourteen, and had not been introduced to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more than once that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her husband. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, should be the epoch of bereavement into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and dwell upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel in the least sorry about the folly of such strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own life to the protections of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been annouced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to be in the company of friends, hastened thither. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly dared to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was compelled to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again besore him–circumstances lined up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was rosting upon. It was impossible that it could be reversed; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he endeavoured to ask concern of Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near regiment. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in some conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Reinforce your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was almost distracted. If before his mind had been occupied by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty as the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister.\nHer attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt departure. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been louched by him. But if he were to take the oath, and disclose his suspension, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already meted. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, begged him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he was as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midday damps. He was no longer to be rescued; at first he returned with the deceased to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were surprised by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than they had any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he was surrounded by his enemies, many of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom in his presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, those whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, accordingly, withdrew.\nSeeing that his mind was becoming impaired, they thought it high time to resume again the strictures which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDeirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had frequently encountered during his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of which they complained solly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so complete was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of her sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his answer was, \"True!\" Once again he fell into a slate, whence not even he could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the week, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this assurance of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again guilty of being offecled by the influence of her love; for he pulled her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so disliriguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived aocket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the feature of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under soot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a most unpleasant expression, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and though this was but a return of his disorder, enjoined, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged them to delay but they refused. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with no one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was adjudicated insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gathered this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection far the brother and jilrest in his fate, gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Whose could resist his power? Histongu had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, her existence, had he gone to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important embalming, which served as an excuse for haretening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physioian and his guardian, attempted to bribe the constables, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few days that marriage, on which he reserved the most heavy curses. The servant promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it useless to disturb any more the mind of Miss Avrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the poor inmates of the house; and Aubrey beard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the riotes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages brook on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at once aroused their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his hand by force, dragged him from the room, sputtering with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride today, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not communicated to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was suspended, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness affected; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be informed, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the prisoner has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubroy's sister had gurgled the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORBYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, when he came to his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, he put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of reach for ship's bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watching, and the purser bargaining far cattle will the ship.\nThe clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave which led Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ido (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English man, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucco. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Grange, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zechines for him, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he was in his habit of travelling to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our cousin resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conveyed us over the mountain. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor–an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a dressing-room–with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply furnished: plain green-slained walnut, marble tables on either side, a large rhododendron in the centre, and a small four-innant beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a mantle bearing Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bedroom had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stusfed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a considerable recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papors, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think our selves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess are Voltoire's, Speare's, Boileau's, and Rousscau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Ernpires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Los, an Italian novel, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were sold willy market.\nSome notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also wore remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading the books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the otbers; but,\" said he, \"that they must lie unlit until his return; for he is so particular, that if I should move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except two pence weekly which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought there from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was plopping. The column in front was fifty paces long and four feet broad, and the fluted marble pillars with lock plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were several feet higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong crape linens. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachrymcle christi,\" and voting fruit, and enjoying the evening breezes.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, as a streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" that he was very faithful, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A strong stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea is clear as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, surrounded by lofty chesnut and maple-trees, several small islands can be distinctly observed, sludding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic society: none knew his name but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Calais. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned several young girls when he was last upon the Isle, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these art.\n-icles. He also bought a now boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek teas to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very ecclesiastical and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, when our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most charming daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had boughl her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the iriformation with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Grecce could be. He had much that was evident: he had pugnacity of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispensed. Founding in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recuse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, and may be plainly gathered from these little anecdoties. All the finer feclings of the hoart, so elegantly deposed in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the reproach of salitude is an additional reason marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Berievolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. In respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with contempt, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of great genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testmony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "37": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidor\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is sounded if very general in the East. Among the Arabs this occurrence appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latiny body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graues, and feeding upon their children. The blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fainted, and the veins became divided to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of courthous interest, account of a particular case of vampyriſm, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the police, they positively and unanjokingly affirmed, that, about five years before, a certair de Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a menace to himself; for, about twenty-one or twenty-two days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that several persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) almost entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid liquid. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A slash was driven entirely through the arm and hand of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. Then, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with regard to those persons who had preuiously died from vampirism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous scene is here relaled, because it seems better adapted to jellustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations absolutely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, Thy corse shall first be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the slain of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, though they yet expire, Shall know the demon for their fire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withcred on the cross. But one that for thy crime must be forgiven, The youngest, best beloved of all, shall never have a father's name—that word shall wrap his heart in flames! Yet thou must undertake this task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last gassy glance must view which freezes on its lifeless blue; Then with your allowed hand must tear The tresses of her left bair, of which, like life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thine own best blundering tongue, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, till these horrors shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sime has alluded in his wild but beautiful poem to \"Thalaba,\" the vain description of the Arabian maid Oneida, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him whom she loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a perfect type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of severa astonishing cases of vampirism, to which he preends to have been on eyewall; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and historical narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbarian error.\nMany documentaries and interesting notices on this singularly borrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Vampyro is the one in general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in more illustrious parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a man, more remarkable for his habits, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth approaching him, as if he could not predict therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the female attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came; but some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, six inches up from the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; many wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to considerable excitement, and now felt the weight of indifference, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engagment their attention. In consequence of the deadly brutality of his face, which seemed to have grown a warmer tinge, both from the loss of modesty, and from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and appearance were beautful, many of the female hurlers of notoriety attempted to win his attention, and gain, at least, some measure of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the inockery of a monster shewn in drawing-room since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attain his notice:–but in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apperently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But when the common address could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was foreign to him: yet such was the apparent conduct with which he spoke to the virtuosity wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his parent hatred of vice, he was as often among the females who form the boast of their sex and their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lyon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who gave it their duly merely to take care of his fortune, when they relinquished him. On the more important charge on his mind to the care of mercenary soldiers, he devoted more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' appearances. He believed in justice, and though that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the genre, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of the cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular folds and varied coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his coming into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which could describe with least truth their languishing orromping savourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brashing couritenances when he approclched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his riches. Attached as he was to the regiment of his solitary hours, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and describer in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludge. Finding, however, no compensation in his gratisied insanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, overtook him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, except the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the object of their observation: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that furnished its proponence to extravagant ideas, he soon formed that object into the hero of a romance, and determined to obey the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him visits, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He subsequently learnt that Lord Rennless's affairs wore embezzled, and soon learned, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of obtaining some information respecting this singular character, who, time and again, had ony whetted his curjosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to induce the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous indiscretions are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry of praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flottered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apporently, had nothing in common with other men, he gradually accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the official motives to his conduct. His character was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not resist remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosity, reduced to indigence by the malaise attendent even upon virtue, that he bestowcd his alms; they were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneer; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicarious, which general prevalls over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still much impugned upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion fought for the centres of all fashionable vice; here he erited into all the spirit of the far-right: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unhinged face, with which he generally watched the society passing: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed impossible.\nForune's law–this apparent abstrutable state of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dollying with the half-dead mouse. In every way, he left the formerly affluent youth, from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the soliloude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst any a father sat frantic, amidst the spoaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, which to him was sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this might but be the result of a corrupt degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reproach this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and piety which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own interests; but He refused it–for a day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of willfully wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imaginationbegan to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the marriage circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another infamous city. Whilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he addressed with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing of affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; is it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, the letters seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adulterous had not rested in hatred of their character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the female, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of urbane virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all the females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask off, and had not scruplcd to expose the whole deforinily of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the mean while, to watch him exceedingly closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by without being noticed. He entered into the same circle, and so perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he so frequently frequented. In England, it is seldom that an unmarried female is mingled with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his career in secret; but Anne's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an accusation had been apposed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent thoughtless girl. In no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his opinion with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his interitions were merely as he supposed all would be upon such an occasion; and upon being prefsed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediatly writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must cease accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he directed his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with reference to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsular, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his side in the house of a Greek; and immersed himself in tracing the faded records of annals upon monuments that apparently, as a consequence of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before Christ, had bidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, many would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of a savage creature, for that sleepy luxuriously-looking eye of the animal appeared but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconsoious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it went up in the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effacod tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her skirts falling, as she flitted about, and in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swistly fading hues, it might well excuse the sorgetfulness of the antiquary, who could not escape from his gaze the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms which all fee, but none appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffused by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his children, she would stand and by, and watch the mechanical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of her deceased place; she would then describe to him the circling dance of the open plclin, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of happy memory, the marriage procession she remembered viewing in her infancy; and, turning to subjects that had evidently made greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the sensational tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, exited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dear ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely fernale to prolong his existence by the strangulating moriths, his heart would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horriblest fantasies; but then she began to give him the names of many men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so jubilant, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their evidence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to believe it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these creatures, and his horror was compounded, by hearing a protégé describe the appearance of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ann; her innocence, so contrafted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, Mary-\nHe married an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more and more attached to the most fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian investigation, he would depart, determined not to return until the object was accomplished; but he always found it impossible to concentrate his attention upon the things around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that soemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was uncoriscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in skelling or unoovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they had, with solemn present, affirmed their existence, but with horror at the dreadful name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once warned of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no one would remain, after the day had gone by, upon which they conspired in deration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nightly orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their reproachful statements, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he looked them in the eye at their daring thus to mock a fuperior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Andrews set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melanoholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for he had last night allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put into act upon him. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climate, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoured country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his loss before it was too late. Twilight, in these south-western climates, is entirely unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—the echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to keep him safe from the pelting of the storm. As he approched, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almighty burst; he was startled; but, roused by the thundor which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the house. But. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, when he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He came himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again basfled!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his position and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the window which gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he insensibly rose, and, leavin\nHe, seeing his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the inud wall, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. The desire of Aubrey was that he searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the flash of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair companion brought in a lifelike consternation. He shut his eyes, hoping to forget. It was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the form, when he unclosed them, strewn by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lips; and there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there: on her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men exclaimed, crying, simultaneously bursting with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A family was suddenly formed, and Aubrey was overwhelmed by the loss of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconscionably in his hand a naked dagger of a particular manufacture, which had been found in his hut. They were met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of someone whom a mother had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe the grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corsice. They were inconstable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in the intervals he would call upon Lard Ruthven and upon Ianthe, and by some peculiar combative combative he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the girl he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at the time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter recoucred from his delirium, he was excited and excited at the sight of his son, whose image had now combiried with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutledge, by his kind words, indicating almost repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and still more by the attentions, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His manner seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his condition began to be rapid, he invariably reverted into his previous state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. Durring the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raifed by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastieity of spirit which had once so distinguished him seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silenience as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; and when it came to the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthe's form would always be by his side; but when be sought out in the woods, her light step would appear wandering about the underbrush, in vest of the modest violet; and occasionally lurning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He directed to fly sceries, every feature of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Routhven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were largely the work of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the fear of those whom they defended from perceived dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few gentlemen, more to serve as guides than as a crew. Upon entering, however, a narrawindile, at the bottom of which was the head of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engclosed in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the excited report of several guns. In an instant their guards had rushed forward, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment behind the shifting turn of the defile: but alarmed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting words bade them advance, and being exposed to continuing slaughter, if one of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having advanced upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence, the latter being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he gave an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had borne the occurrence about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind came apparently uneasy, and his eyes fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my acquaintance as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, my friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubry. -\"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the world–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my bonour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. –\"It may not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear to all your soul reveres, by all our nature fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deeds to any living being in any way, what may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with the man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from some presentiment af something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the house in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by servants and emigrants, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it would be exposed to the first cold ray of morning that rose after his departure. Aubrey appalled, and taking several of the men, compelled to cut it up and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was wildered in conjuction, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible missortunes, and which had apparently conspired to hoighton that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects be had with him originating from Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of execution, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were sever daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastering to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, with peculiar peculiarities.\nArgyle shaped, the sheath he held in his left hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to believe; but the particular form, the same varying spots upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on one side, and lest no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerned the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduction arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became morose and sombre; and his only occupation remained in urging the speed of the proceedings, as though he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon blew him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his friends, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she hitherto, by her irreligious caresseſ, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exults in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was suddenly lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul consciences of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light fluttering, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may add—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother was close to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his life, who would have changed her mind for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on his face were then playing in the light of their own native spectacles. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefor, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the point of her entry into the \"big scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his friends, and fed up with the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel in the least about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which they announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all about him, engaged in the remembrances that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs most refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriageway, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were hursting from his head. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the nightmare his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for although he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of some matrimonial, he retired into a room, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were coming, he roused himself, and entering an adjoining room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang for war, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the passage: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn round, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey was almost murdered. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it eroded, now that the certainty of the monster's living existence presaged upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrors.\nHe married her. The more he thought about it, the more he was bewildered. His oath bound him; was he then to allow this monstrosity to roam, boaring ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and discard his fuspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a shame; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only with his sister, who, with eyes streoming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing sorrow and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His habits became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the mid-night damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at once he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him running from a place swifter than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whom in whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him quietly, anxious to forewarn, in respect of his oath, a man whom Lord Ruthven apprached with in confidence.\nMacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guards thought it proper to induce him, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDefirous of saving him from the injuries and sufforings he had daily encounter in his wonders, and of preventing him from expasing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by this terrible subject. His illness became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy hue; the only sign of affection and affection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely offended her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, do do not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a slate, whence not even she could roufe him. This lost him many friends: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his appearance threw off some of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count on his finger a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician on the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of retributive action, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Montgomeryshire. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be pre sent to the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was immediately again capable of being affected by the effect of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing from the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distanced from rank and honourable assistance; when he suddenly placed a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at bearing the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it with his feet. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the likeness of her former husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a frantic expression of courteousness, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and policeman, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but the return of his daughter, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, be implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning in the drawing-room, and had been reproved with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could scarcely be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the latter and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Ann Smyre. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with anyone on the erowded earth, except with her to whom he oddressed himself; could tell that since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in short, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's degraded state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physicion and his guard, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valved her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their happiness, to delay but for a few days that marriage, on which he denounced the most unholy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages passing upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The jury returned a verdict.\nSome of the servants at last gave up their vigilance, and gradually slipped away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the corridor where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, dragged him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, for not my bride to day, your master is dishonoured.\" Women are frak! So saying, she pushed him towards two clerks, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding expression, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was confined to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he received, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Londonderry.\nAubrey's health rapidly declined; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guard to be called, and when the midnight holler had struck, however–contrary to what the reader has perused–he died immediate after.\nThe guardians endeavoured to apprehend Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthver had disappeared, and Aubroy's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\nThe world was before him, where to choose his pace of rest, and Providence his guide.\n\"I.e.\"\nIN sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Milylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies far out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and I went down a rainble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a splendid mountain range) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his coffin. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would take me with him; but I did not want to quit Marylebone, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English compensation).\nHe resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our regimentaryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting porlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large cauch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pajamas. The defendant had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with a stuffed cotlon quilt and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seamclin' chest in the room: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recorder lay Voltaire's, Schapare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volricy's Roads of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; M'Lton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editor, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press on Constantinopoe, much torn, but no English copy of any doscription. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading the books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie untill his return; for he is so particular, that were I to say one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a favour; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom I brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was five hundred paces long and three feet broad, and the fluted marble pilasters with black plinths and fret-work cornice, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a large stone balustrade, was covered by a heavy Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of thick coarsen linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon which the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachrymna christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side, as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and apples were cluttering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I supposition,\" said the old man, \"praying\" that he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sunday services.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A great steam issuing from the wheels descended in brokon cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the deceased's house. The sea is smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the valley in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of tall cebnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did here; but all inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this remote settlement: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Caridia. \"The Armenian,\" said our correspondent, \"could tell, but I am sure he did not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the imprisoned lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to other men, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often read Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and debauched character. One circumstantial we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and given her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the inforination with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of great position, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our differences were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxiously, is Lard Byron; I met him in my travels on the Isle of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his name's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Catherine Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more thorough in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of cold, unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his house. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the purpose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a cousinman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are to be recieved with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, altogether may censure the error of a fellow-man. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his praise. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuoso mind and self-approving coriscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Pririter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "38": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and farmed the subject of any wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and descending upon the blood of the living beautified. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that bandits generally imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died on consumptions; whilst the unfortunate blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a point of repletion, as to cause blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vice-marriage, which is said to have occurred at Madreygcl, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paule, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by cutting some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days aftor his death and burial, many persons complained of having been harassed by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of food by his ottacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and eyes, pure amber fluid. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, on which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. When they were done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted against the interests of those persons who had previously suffered from vampyrism, so that they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who threatened them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by poison becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in others turn.\nChilwell bailiff.\nThis monstrous crime is here related, he cause it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other evidence which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampirism, but compelled to regulate his infernal visitations religiously to the beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corse shall from his tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and sully the blooms of all thy ranks; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at once drain the stream of life; Yet from the banquet which perforce must feed thy enemies, Thy victims, though they yet expiro, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flocks are withered on the stem. But one that knows thy crime must first fall, The youngest, beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name. That word shall wrap thy heart round life! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view Whose head freezes over its lifeless blue; The with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses from her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's solemn pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Memorial of the agony! Yet with the own blood shall drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and will Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild and beautiful poem of \"Thaaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneizcl, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have recovered from the sinfulness of her life, she being presented to the readers of the tale as a complete type of purity and jinnocence. The veracious Tremort gives a long account in his travel of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness. Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variely of anecdotes, and historical narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbarian error.\nMany curious and intemperate occurrences of this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be conoluded by merely remonstrating, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of in various ports of the world: as Vroucalocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Buccoloko, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the middle of the dissipations occurred upon a London win.\nIn consequence, there appeared at the frequent parties of the leadors of the regiment a man, more remarked for his manners, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth coursing through him, as though he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair woman excited his attentions, that he might by chance look upon it, and throw himself into the breasts where thoughtless habits reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it came: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, falling upon the prisoner's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leader ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having someone in their presence capable of engagling their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which gradually gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the vigorous movement of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hangers after notoriety attempted to win his attentions.\nLadies, and gentlemen, at least, same marks of what they might term affliction: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did nothing but put on the head of a mantle, to attract his notice:–though in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common men could not influence him without the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which ho spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it evoked the dread of his sombre character, or that they were moved by his apparent hotred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lyon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an unmarried sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty mere to take care of his fortune, when they relinquished the more imporant charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cullivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high reputation for honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprenticeships. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Provider merely for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely eonsisted in the vesting of clothing, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: all these things.\nUpon his entering in the gay circles, many mothers supported him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at some time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon drew him into their notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romances of his youth, he was startled at finding that, except in the lallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundance in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumcs, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compunction in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man enviously abused in himself, who gave few other signs of his observance of extemal objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of human contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object into the object of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of such union, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advertised upon his notice, that his presence was always recognisably. He gradually learnt that Lord Rutbven's finances were embarrossed, and so was found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, the place he was about to trovel. Desirous of obtaining some information respecting his singular character, who, till now, had only whet his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian that it was time for him to perform the tour, which since many generations has been thought necessary to induce the young to take some ropid steps in the career of man, towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to oppear as prey from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of platoons of praise, according to the degree of skill required in corrying them off. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of affection from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had the opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now found, that, though many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagaband, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosos, reduced to indignity by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he gave his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to walow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicar, which generically contrasts with the reticent bashfulness of the venerable indigenes. There was one circular about the character of his Lordship, which was still more impressible upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his compariion sought for the centres of all sashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generically watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of a novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed contrary to fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he found the formerly affluenly youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this folly; whilst many a father became frantic, amidst the speaking cries of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immeasurably wealth, with to buy anything sufficient to satisfy their present craving. The took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of matching the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasurable which proved the ruin of his life, and did not tend to his own profit; but he dreaded it, for each day he hoped his friend would give him an opportunity of speaking honestly and openly to him; but, thankfully, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and during the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Avrey was always in the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater satisfaction from it than the constant excilement of vainly wishing to break the mystery, which to his exalted imagination begait to assume the appearance of some extraordinary supernatura.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoranda of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, containing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astoriished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and charged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irresistable powers of seductian, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his enetempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratisication, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposit the whole desolation of their vices into the public gaze.\nAubrey discharged upon arrival.\nThis one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abaridding him of her, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him exceedingly, and to let no suspicious circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inoxperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with indifference; he was therofore obliged to carry on his plan in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been oppointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innately, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of him being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his interitions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must refrain from accompanying his Lordship in the remand of their proposed tour, he ordered his servants to seek other employment, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was preverited. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; he did not raise any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his ship towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon inscriptions that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a palnter to pour tray on canvass that promised hope to the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could lead to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated naturc, for that sleazy, sullen look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Avrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of some mysterious buttery, show the whole beauty of her form, fluttering as it were upon the wind, and the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almofl effaced desk, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figurines. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such dolicently briliant and swistly fading spots, it might reveal the forgetfulness of the annullary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of of great importanee to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to prescribe choruses which all agree, but none can appreciate? –It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling ballrooms. Whilst he drew those pictures of which he wished to preserve a memorial far his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her former place; she would then describe to him the ceaseless dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of her happy memory, the marriage procession she remembered viewing in infancy; and then, referring to matters that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her extraordinary description and appclrent belief of what she described, excited the interest even of Avrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced himself upon them each year, by feeding upon the flesh of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idiotic and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarking, that those who had dared to question his existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, touched his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English blood, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseclaration, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he often found it impossible to fix his attentions upon the objects before him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his possessions. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank and fantastic being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hands of time. She had appealed to her porents on the subject of Vampyres, and they whole, with many present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at once, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and described the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, inferrial power, the very name of which immediately made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the meloncholy state of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible creatures, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night all seemed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the morning there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—it thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feel. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The collision at last, through fury, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel which hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the other side, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment, allowed him to hear the dreadful fainting cries of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: and, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the house. He found himself in utter darkness: the snake, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; and, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice exclaimed, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his wife as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his spot and hurled with enormous force against the grove: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his head when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave way in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was raging still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded every individual straw with heavy fakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they separated from her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches one more bore upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifelike condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he opened them, streaked by his tears. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even on her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached to the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the wound:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously slunk with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refloction, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconscionably in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engoged in the sight of her whom a whole had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewamed the parents of this dreadful catastrophe. To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died brokenhearted.\nAubrey going to bed was seized with a violent fever, and was often delirious; in those intervals he would call on Lord Ruthven and upon himself; upon some unfortunate combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecise molested children upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at that time to arrive at Athens, and, from what seemed verifiable, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constable attendant. When the lad recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Routhven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, so reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed scarcely changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but after some time his convalescence began to become rapid, be again degenerated into the same state as before, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the early stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged either in watching the tideloss wave's raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbits, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAurey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distressed him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and seclusion as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side; if be sought in the woods, her lightslep would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they gradually began to slight the reports, which they imagined were ony the invention of indolent spirits, whose object it was to excile the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, through, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the excited report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to follow the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the shearers.\nAtering turn of the file: but ashamed of being detained by a foe, who with insulting shoutings bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should come above and take them in the rear, they desisted at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the canlest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces close around him–his guards having, upon Lord Rutbaven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promisos of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey the wounded prisoner to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being there merely to guard the establishment until their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortality ensued, and death seemed advancing with slow steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as before. He had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer him assistance with more than his usual earnestness—\"Afsift me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I care not my life, I heed the dictates of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot exploit the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were safe from the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear! by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, that, for a year and a day you will not impinge your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altending his acquaintance with this man remained upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaking him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and his comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking some of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. He, when he had mounted to the summit, found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. Far a lime his mind was filled in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstilious melancholy which had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortranto, or Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a box containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were feveral daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning some things over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparenlly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the woapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the porticula farm, the same varylling tints upon the haft and shaft, were in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also draps of hood on both.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way homo, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repulsive horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became ruffian and silent; and his only occupation remained in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he considered dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to bask, in the embraces and embraces of his sister, in a memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained some affection, upon that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not the winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the dressing-room assemblies. There was much of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded establishment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the moment. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter future. His step was not that lightfooting, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and penitent. When alone, her face was never brightened by the sensation of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the sorrows of the world? It seemed as if those eyes…\nThat face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eight years, and had not been presented to the world, having been though by her guardions more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the company of his friends, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel in the least about the frivolities of fashion and strangers, when his heart had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which they had advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a crowd by himself, completely unaware of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too wel, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refused to bear his weight, he was compelled to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his cloak, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were slipping from his brain. Lord Ruthven stood before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He revved himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rife again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to obtain information concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he struggled to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Reverse your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distanced. If before his mind had been absorbed by this subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the morister's verdict again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt departure. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath slurred him; how could he then allow this murderer to roam, bearing plunder under his breath, as he held deor, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but duty, he remembered, had been all but mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he lest leave his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon day sun as to the midnight damps. He wasn't able to be recognized; at first he returned with the children to the house; but at last he laid himself down to rest wherever fatigue overlook him. His sister, anxious for his safely, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled through a window swifter than any could be bought. His conduct, however, sudderily changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose presence they wore unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him close, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Routhven approached with interest. But when he entered into a roam, his haggard and suspicious eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his father was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unnecessary, the guineas thought proper to introbe, and, fearing that his mind was becoming agitated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's porents.\nDesirous of rescuing him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they induced a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice him, so completely was his mind absorbed by one torrible occurrence. His incoherence became at once so great, that he was consined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection of recollection having displayed itself upon the appearance of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted him, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences came less frequent, and his mind threw off a portend of its gloom, whilst his guard observed, that several times in the day he would count upon himself a definite nutter, and smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey being in so awful a fit, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he listened anxiously to whom. In consequence of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been degraded, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met in company, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his readiness to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irruption of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once again alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the fancies of the monster which had so long occupied his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this murderer, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if the woman again bade him reinstate his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthvon was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was the return of his disorder, cautioned, and sorcing him from Miss Avrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the infanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after into the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readlly understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companiori, and, by constant appearance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the car of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded carth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his affection, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her distinct accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardian, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms and their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which be denounced the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the inind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the rovings of a man. He passed on without rest to the busy inner part of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be imagined than described, the sounds of some terrible preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overtook their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assailed. LATEST. Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. Wheron on the stair-case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister has dishonoured. Women are frail!\" He saying, he pushed him towards his attendances, who, roused by the old man, had come in search of him. Avrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blow-vase, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not communicated to the prisoner, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the roader has perused–he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Larder had appeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN passing through the Grecjan Arohlopago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables alwoys to be had there, induce many British seamen to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties almost repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the hay, and whilst the men were employed in watching, and the purser barging.\nIn looking for cattle with the natives, the clergymen and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, whoro we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a mountain monticule so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but very good man. The cottage on the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he had left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but it was not constant; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet enclosed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-staincd walls, marble tohings on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen brown cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the cornmon bed through which Greeley came. In the sitting-room we obserued a marble chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the dock: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the table of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bolleau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Rules of Empires; Zimmman, in the German language; Klapock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play on the Robbers; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1846; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to lace them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is not altogether very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm and the burden of taking care of it, except two pence cheques which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted pilasters with black plinths and freestone cornice, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong caarse linen. Most of the house-tops are well furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side, as we approached the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapevines, orangos and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seal with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and mornings till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himsels. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this window was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vegetable gardens led him up to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit on which an ancient Greek temple clapped in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken easements, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unfhadowed by a single cloud, terminated the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did of him; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could come, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you come, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armerian, but on our return to the town we learnt some particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave ox to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boot for a gentleman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek teats to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we collected, to have been a very eccentric and nevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing what this ramblor in Greece might be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which inark peculiarity. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Founding in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been lravelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Constantinople.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calclo in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been gravely slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, utterly opposed to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to its woes, or add to its pleasures. The fault is directly the revoir, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feasts of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lord's poems, should have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his acts: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason far reaching him from a man on whose head Religion hath set her seal, and upon whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read his preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling fond of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with great caution, particularly when concerned with a man's moral integrity; and he who must justify himself before that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a voracious heart and serene conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "39": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which his tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Llantin and Greek cburches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Llan body could not be recovered if buried in their territory, it gradually died, and formed the subject of many wonders.\nThere are, however, fears extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the habits of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and fainted on the spot.\n-sumptions; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened, and their throats became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, if a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the regiment, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that about five years before, a certain German, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, at Clerkenwell, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been threatened by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the monster's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that several persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their doctors, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emaciated at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blooms. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, upon which he is reported to have cried out dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The horses were adopted with the corses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person seduced by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his blood.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous occurrence is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In some parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed while in existence, that the condemned is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal thoughts solely to those beings he loved in the while upon earth—thoseto whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre serit, thy corse shall lie in its tomb until rent; Then ghefty haunt the native place, and drink the blood of all thy race; Take from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnigh drain the stream of blood; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing thee; By flowers which withered on the stem. But one that for all crime must fall, The youngest, most beloved of all, shall bless thee with a father's name. That word shall wrap you up in flamo! Yet thou must do thy task and mark her cheek with last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed violence you shall tear the tresses of her long hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Memorial of terrible agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing loath, and haggard lip; Thon talking to thy sullen grave, Go down with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also delighted in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returried from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this can not be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, for he being presented throughout the whole of the tale af a particular type of purity and innocence. The gentleman Tournefort gives a long account in three volumes of some most astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calinet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of cliches, and tradilionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting facts on this singularly horrible superstitian must be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, purely devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that although the term Voodoo is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroueolocha, Vardoulacba, Goul, Broucke, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his sirigularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth surrounding him, as if he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a miracle quell it, and thraw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness resided. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attached it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one point to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden weight that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, when his form and outlino were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been a mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountaineer, to attract his attention:–though in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were undefended;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But since the common adultress could not influence him without the guidance of his eyes, it was clear that the female sex was indisferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he addressed to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning lover; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as esteemed among those femoles who could boast of their sex from their domestic virtuves, as among those who despised their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was a orphan left with an unmarried sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by creditors, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more imporant charge of his mind to the care of mereenary subordinates, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' acquaintances. He believed all to sympathise with him.\nHe believed that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque aspect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the conditions.\nHe's eye by his irregulcl folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of children were the realities of life. He was some, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay trades, many mothers surrounded him, striving which would describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the doughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approoched, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no sound at all from real life for ony of that congeries of pleasing pictures and description contined in those volumes, from which he had formed his sludge. Finding, however, no compensation in his grandified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have ever known, accompanied him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, the tacit assent to their absence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensities to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this acquaintance into the object of a romance, and determined to observe the springs of his fancy, rather than the person besore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced up his acquaintance, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were occupied, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some uniformation respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to form the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if distant from the society, wherher scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in corrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a kindness from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly acceded it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his contemporaries were opposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions regarding the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Mr. Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indignity by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his troubles, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sirik him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevailed over the retiring bashfulness of the voracious iridigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he penetrated into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known culprit was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always the same unchanging course, willh which he generally watched in the society round: he was not, however, so indifferent when he encounterod the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish feemed folly's law—this abstractedness of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the child who was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In this way, he left the formerly affable youth, torn from the circle he had adorned, cursing, in the throes of a dungcon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whist many a father sat frantic, amid the speaking looks of mute hungry children, with but a single shilling of his immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took some money from the gombling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the first gilder he had just snatched from the conulsive grasp of the innocent: his might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, equal to comboting the cunning of the more experienced. Aubry often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charley and pleasure which proved the ruin of him, and did not tend to his own profit; but he always delayed it, for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but never, this occurrence occurred. Lard Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the variables and scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spokeless than his lip; and when Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he elicited no joy from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his attentive eye began to assume the appearance of something sinister.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was still engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonishing him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, the letter seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belittlement.\nF. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licenlious habits most dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated from any weakness of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his glory, that the victim, the partner of his lust, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vullied virtue, down into the lowes abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his deposition, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole depravity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvbrey determined upon leaving one, whose condition had not yet shawn a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the intimate experience of the daughter of the lady whoso house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried woman is included in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secrecy; but Aubrey's curiosity followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been concluded, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though boughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very evening. Lord Rutbaven answered, that his intentions were the same as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merrily laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, he told her all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concorning the character of his Lordhip. The signature was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his serjeant to notify his complete assent to a separation; he did not hint any suggestion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his sleps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found him at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so occupied himself tracing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, still stand.\nInstead of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before saves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many crowded lilies. Undoubtedly, the same woman as himself, existed so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to paint on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Manchester's paradife, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the pavement, or tripped along the millenarian's path, one would have thought that the girl was a poor type of her beauties; for who could have exchanged her eye, appareritly the eye of animated nature, for that sugary luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and ongoing upon the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of the Kashmere buttorfly, he saw the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an alm effaced table, in the contomplication of her sylph-like features. She had her tresses falling, as she flitted around, and in the sun's ray such delicately brilliculously and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the offence.\nThe effrontery of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pavonis. But why attempt to describe charm which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his wound hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describo to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of her youth, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent sincerity of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by fecusing upon the body of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her off of her idle and horriblest fantasies; but she cited to him the names of several old men, who, had at last detected one living among themselves, and several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she had said so incredulous a thing, it was hard of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and bemusement, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditonal appearance of the monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty anatomical description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in promising her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondored at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite his belief in the supernaturol power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her innocence, so contrasted with all the affections of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of romance, were his heart; and while he ridiculized the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Dutch girl, still he found himself more attached to her.\nHe clung to the old fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian salvation, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he sometimes found it impossible to keep his attentions upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in skeching or uncovoking some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with severance present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the narne of the canal, they at once begged of him not to return alight, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of the representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very thought of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unalarmed; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them to such error. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, for night allowed the power of those beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizons there would be one of those specks which, in the warmer climatos, so rapidly gather into a tremor, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is a most unkind time; immediately the sun sets, night begins. Before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying canvas, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he discovered, by the glare of lightning, that ho was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself above the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to obtain shelter from the peltings of the storm. As he approached, the deceased, for a moment silencing, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of the woman, and the stifled, exultant mookery of her laugh, concluded in one almost unhroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperturbed; for, when he be called, the proceedings continued, and notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with some woman, whom he immediatoly seized; but a voice cried, \"Agairi baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat, when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that had been made in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was strong, and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was long in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the lorches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition? He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a dream arising from his disturbed imagination; but he immediately saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his arms. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attoching as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and chest was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men rushed, crying, simultaneous struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and sairy vislons, now follen with the flower of life that had departed from her. He knew not what his troubles were–his mind was blanked and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in violence–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met with different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadsul cataclysm. –To describe their grief would be impossiblity; but when they understood the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the horse. They were inconstable.\nThey both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fury, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Henderson; by some unaccounlable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate malodictions upon his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from personal motive, upon bearing of the name of Aubrey, immediately placed him in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and saddened at the sight of him, whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being that had so astonished Aubrey; but as during his convalescence he seemed to be recovering, he eventually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubroy perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in morking the progress of those orbs, circling, like round the world, the moving sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solace.\nIf his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly occupied, Anthea's form would appear at his side—if he fought in the wood, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would come, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, and a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenos, one feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet visited. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they hastened from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robberies, but gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow valley, at the bottom of which was the head of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipiccs, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing their muskets and rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the swelling turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by their foe, who with insulting shouts made them advance, and being exposed to an unresisting charge, if any of the robbers should climb above and cut them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in fear of the destruction. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer keeping the contest at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and dispersed.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being provided merely to guard the entrance till the complainant should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Rulhven's strength rapidly declined; and two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uncouplicable of pain as he had been of the injuries inflicted upon him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind came apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Auhrey, who was led to offer his assistance with more than his usual gentleness—\"Help me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my children as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my house, your family, your friends. \"HARD?\" Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I meant but little–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and is my death was unknown for some time in England–I—I—bless you.\" \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exullant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes and death to any living being in any way, what you see, or whatever you may see.\" His eyes seemed bulging from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laugting upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to bed, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering come over him, as if from the presonculent of something horrible awalting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and his companions, upon his retiring, to the pinnacles of a nearby mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first old ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aurey astonished, and taking several of the men, decided to go and bury it up on the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the top, he found no trace of either the corpse or the clogs, although the robbers swore they had picked out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convincingly that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a county in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a servant to convey him to Ortranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effeels he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atags. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a dagger apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discavered in the fatal hut–he exclaimed–hastening to gain some composure, he sight the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, although peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the circular form, the same varying tints upon the blade and sheath were all in sploridour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on the floor.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had employed to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduction chambers. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had been a victor to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and melancholy; and his only occupation consisted in urging the prosecution of the prisoners, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the Eriglish shores; and he clung to the arms of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the ironbraces and cuffs of his suit, all memory of the past. If she before, by her insatiable egotism, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that brashness which sometimes exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was constantly lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling of melancholy, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which trays where a fly or a colour might attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes were then ploying in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only fourteen, and had not yet presented to the world, having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her representative. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy feene.\" He would have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the politics of fashionable strangers, when he had been so shocked by the events he had witnessed; he would be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excess.\nSuch a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened to enter. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whistleblower. As he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, saunded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on the spot upon his first entry into society. He groaned till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid. All his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances slarted up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, but could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that he could be real; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he intended to ask concealing Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few hours afterwards with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there went himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he followed them, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several men, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him the features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's hand, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servitors who were waiting for the lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard the voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, still reached home.\nAubrey became ill and was discharged. Before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, but much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his bankrupt conduct. He only said a few words, and those terrified her. The more he bought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roar, bearing raving upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its consequences? His very sister might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from this wretched creature; but death, he remembered, had been already inocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, and, with eyes swelling with tears, begged him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he lofted himself from window to window, endeavouring to fly that mantle which haunted him. His dress became ragged, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the mid-night gloom. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he put him down to rest where fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his abasement the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter back into society, and watch him closely, anxious to warn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he be entered into a marriage, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last induced to beg of him to abstain from seeing, for her sake, a sociability which affected him so strongly. When, however, correspondence proved unclenching, the guardians thought proper to effect, and, searing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey.\n[SUBJECT.]\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountored in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible tragedy. His incoherence became al laft so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had become a glassy luscence; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would somersault, and, seizing her hands, with looks that nearly assaulted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he fell into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherence became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portent of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would call upon his finger a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly eloped, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his friends entering his room, began to communicate with his physician on the melancholy circumstantial of Aubrey being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of his mark of returning into consideration, of which they believed he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marrsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted wisdom, and to commend her upon her marriage to a man so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lock upon her breast; peeling it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reputation of her former husband, he looked as though he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a sullen expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he was– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that witness again bade him remember his oath–he looked suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the physicians and physicion, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disease, entered, and foreing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them not to delay but for one day. They, attributing the insanity to the insanity they indicted had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, but failed.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been acquainted with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was diagnosed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this loyalty. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by cousin attendance, and the pretence of great affection, kissed her.\nWith respect for his brother and interest in music, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recover.\nHe could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell him that since he knew her, his existence, had ceased to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he coveted her affections. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the inarriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged conduct,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was separated from the physiclan and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servant, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, consoling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the basis of their house, to delay for a few hours that morrow, on which he denounced the most heavy penalties. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the prisoner, he thought it would be riot to harass any man in the neighbourhood of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may not easily be described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the noise of corriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an exhausted old woman. He seized the opportunity, when one bourd was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were now assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking him by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister has dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him to his attendant, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was present when he entered, as the physicari was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the ride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's governesses might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he repeated exactly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardian hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when he arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disclosed, and Aubrey's sister had had the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S SUICIDE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, he had to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we passed into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. Welcomed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men wore themselves out in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with other officials, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the two days prior to our arrival in his custody. \"He described me as a pilat,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malinoe, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundred zechines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his feluccia very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were immediately received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of three apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a dressing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-room with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decoraled: pale green-stained walls, marble labels on each side, a large laurel in the centre, and small fountains throughout, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa complemented the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen brown cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, somewhat, the old man told us, silled with books and paper, which were kept in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the row lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Ruscau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzehue's novellas; Schiller's play of the Robors; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian novel, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notos, written with a poncil, in Italian and Lalin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and wanted to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the privilege of the farm and the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was displeasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and thirteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Greek architecture,) were considered a little higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was supported by a fine Turkoy carpot, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening brecques.\nOn the left hand side we entered the house, a small streamlet glided awcly, grapes, oranges and limes were clustered together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtles, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards lodges the eycto Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which a large arch exists. Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream arising from the river descended in broken cascades, until it was last in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the prisoner who had resided in this remote solitude: none knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Calais. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I will not.\" We had no time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt feveral particular of the isolated lard. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who made by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Reek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we cannot forget, which our old friend at the coltage thought best not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forc, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imagination was on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had much, it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccenologicalities which mark peculiar character. Arrived at Palermo, all our things were delivered. Falling in comportment was Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's family, as we had been some years from him; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in this page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Mahlerie on some future day; but to me that day will neuer retum. I make this statement, believing it not to be uninteresling, and in service to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly insulted. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or attempting in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The case was largely the result, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his emotions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whom heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Rports are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character if wholly of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-appreciating conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "40": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually contracted, and formed the subject of many wonderful fables, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blooms of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imitated a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatteried, and their veins contracted to such a slate of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passage of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of ampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. Witnesses, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimous affirmed, that, about five years before, a young man, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Scrutiny, he had been tormented by a vampyre, and had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with it. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twelve or thirteen days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tortured by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and containing at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure white blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A fork was driven entirely through the hcart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cutoff his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corfs of those persons who had previously suffered from vampirism, lest they should, in their lust, become ogents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his own turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous spectacle if here relaled, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observances than any other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visitations only to those friends he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.\nBut first, as Vampyre sent, thy corse shall from his tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt his native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of blood; You loathe the banquet which you perforce must feed thy lying corse, Thy victims, though they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them. The flowers are withered on the stem. But one thing for thy crime must be done: The young lady, who is loved of all, shall bless thee with a other's name—Thatward shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and her last glassy green musk view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her long hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affect's fondest pledge was made; But now is borne away by the Memorial of thine agony! Yet with thy own best blood shall drip; Thy griashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and will Gouls and Afrits rave, Till they in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey has also introduced in his wild and beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vindictive character of the Arclinchari maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She best loved child in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of human life, she being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete picture of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary descriptions illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nSome curious and interesting noticos on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be omitted by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre if the one most generally accepted, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the dinner parties of the lords of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth amusing him, but if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, but he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attested it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; others gazed upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of ennul, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rudesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and out line wore beautiful, many of the female hunters of notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every lady shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all she could to put the dent in a mountebank, to attract his attention: but in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apporently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unplaced; even her outraged impudence was baffling, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that no one knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that they over came the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as popular among those females who form the base of the sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who formed it by their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to Landon a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died when he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by creditors, who thougbt it their duly appointed duty to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more importarit charge of his mind to the care of inercenary servants, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, the high Romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He expected all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that religion was thrown in by Providence morely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we do in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely conspired in the vestiges of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the real titles of life. He was handsome, frank, and charming: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with all truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening appearances when he opproached, and by their fawning eyes, which when he opened his lips, soon led him in to falsified notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of his domestic hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified mood, he was about to resume his duties, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea on the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing which flaunted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced up his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Slreet, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to make some rapid progress in the career of vice lowards putting themselves upon equal quality with the aged, and thus allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Arnold, immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apperently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the curious watchers.\nHitherto, Avrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, although many of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different consequences from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagaband, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid marking, that it was not upon the voracious, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with largely suppresed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask sornething, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his sorrow, or to sink him still deeper in his infirmity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, ascribed by him to the greater importunity of the vicissitudes, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuosi lndigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Majesty, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those persons to whom it was bestowed, immediately found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the abyss, or sunk to the lowest and the most wretched misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained with success, except where the sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unfailing face, with which he generally watched the society around: he was not, however, a gentleman. So when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the unfortunate fathcr of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed contrary to Murphy's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst lying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he loomed from the circle he adorned, lurking, in the soliloquy of a dungeon, the fato that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; while many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking calls of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their peculiar needs. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the canulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a corruptive disposition of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Avrey osten wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he declined it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, wever, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the eonstant excitement of vairily wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memoranda of another almost deserted city. Whilst she was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great enthusiasm; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affeclion; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before penetrated into his imagination that there was an evil power rosident in this country, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and pleaded, that his character was dreadfully vicissitude, for that the possession of irascible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more danger to society. It had been discovered, that his cravings for the adultress had not originated in any admiration of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratificatiion; that his victim, the parlner of his habits, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and debauchery: in consequence, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a fingle bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, proposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumslations pass unnoticed. He entered into the same room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the indiscretion of the daughter of the lady whose house he so frequently frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarrled female is accepted in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubry's eyes followed him in his windings, and soon discovered that an accusation had been made, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his having spoken about to murder her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed all would bear upon such an occurrence; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that on that morning he must duty accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other employment, and, calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was provented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify him of his concurrence to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Aubrey's intervention.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his stepstowards Greece, and crossing the Pecula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of distant glory upon monuments which apparently, intended for chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sholtering soil or mungily coloured lichen. Under the same roof as she herself, existed a being, so beautful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a person.\nShe was bidding to preach on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had lost their souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped over the mountain's side, many would have thought the girl a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the arms, suited but to the tasto of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, origaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the extraordinary beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the conformation of her sylph-like figure. Often would the dust falling, as she flitted about, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interrelation of a passage in Pausanias. It was innocence, youth, and beauty, uninfested by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate? Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in a the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would render all the superriatural effects of her profession. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often when she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and maintained intimate ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely femme to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such ludicrous and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who, having at once detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question his existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heart-breaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was intensified, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Mary; her inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women originally whom he had sought for his vision of romance, wove his thoughts; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Gael girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would learn himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon those around him, whom in his mind he regarded on image that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was becouse she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guard was occupied in sketching or covering up some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with scrupulousness present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the placc, they all at once begged of him not to rot in it at night, as he would necessarily pass through a doorway, which no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They describod it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and described the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to disturb their peace. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to talk them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was seized.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his expedition unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to discover that his words, inocking the belief of such horrible fiends, had inspired him with such terror. When he was about to part, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, before he allowed the power of these beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that the day would soon end, and that in the horizon the sun was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed whatever delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and as he had advanced further, the power of the storm was abaited–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of respite–its thick heavy rain sorced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue socked lightning seemed to fall almost radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The clanging at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that had recently lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brackwood which surround it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the peltings of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silencing, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockory of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, flung open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, comforted him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his adversary had himself upon him, and kneeling on his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of lightning tearing through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the snapping of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now raging, and Aubrey, capable of moving, was soon heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the fire lagged on every individual straw with heavy flakes on foot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attacked him by her cries; he was almost left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduetress lying in a lifeless state. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stilness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there: –up her neck and breast was blood, and upon her back were the marks of the cutting that opened the wound:–Then one of the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously exclaimed in horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A VARNEY!\" A litter was quickly delivered, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her, who had lately been the object of so many bright and sairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and sereneed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a paralular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different persons who had been engaged in the search of her which a mother had missed. Their terrible cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inseparable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in at intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some uncharacteristic occurrence he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At her times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Richmond, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever molive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became Aubrey's constant attendant. When the lad recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon consoled him to his senses. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so upset Aury; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again degenerated into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intent upon him, with a smilo of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apperently engaged in watching the tideloss waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like round the world, the moving sands;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was as much a lover of soliloude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he went near it near the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's forin stood by his side—if he went in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underbrush, in quest of the mysterious violet; then suddenly turning away.\nSeeing round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a knowing smile upon her lips. He determined to remember these scenes, every feature of which crumbled such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollision could be attached: but when they had passed from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to doubt these robberies, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, through, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; for nearly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and the echoed report of feveral guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retraced for a moment the sheltering turn of the desile: but alarmed of being thus detained by a woman, who wither insultingly bade them advance, and being committed to unresisting servitude, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush for the safety of the commons. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Routhven received a blow in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces approaching him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Russell's strength rapidly declined; in two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the circumstances about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance more than usual. Witness: -Assistance me! You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the dictates of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's bonour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot expain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain from the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I—but life. \" It shall not be known. \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising him fist with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all thy nature sears, swear that for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from the sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubroy; he sunk down. He threw himself upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not what to do; when he awoke an oath of cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something terrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a rober met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by his friends and comrades, upon retiring, to the pinion of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his departure. Aubroy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the interesting rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that pervasive melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a witness to convey him to Ortrarito, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alaghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath opparontly ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–bastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particulate form, the same varylling tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also small drops of blood on both.\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was almost convinced that the lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were ginning to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she be fore, by her infariline cares, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was till incapable attaching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had that winning grace which went the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. The room had none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crawded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not soem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul coruscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—she was more arid pensive. When she came home, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she had destroyed in the rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thougth by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the new drawing-room, which was first appraaching, would be the epoch of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his sister, and fed upon the melancholy which overpawered him. He could not take interest in her. the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a carner by himself, heedless of those round him, engaged in the remembrance that the last time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he found himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had scarcely courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same fagure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first introduction into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his head. Lord Ruthven again besore him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossiblity that he could be restored; he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a guard, he retired in a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he disguised himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to approach and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those fears he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of spectators who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in addressing them, he again heard that voice shout close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became anxious and distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more complete was it engrossed, now that the possibility of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his obrupt conduct. He only utlered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this man to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its disgrace? His wife might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembored, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaking with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the afternoon sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer able to be recognized; at first he returned with the alarm to his house; but at last he laid himself down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced from him who fled from a pursuer without giving him any thought. His conduct, however, sudden changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend almost upon them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Routhven approached with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and suspending looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at once obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a saciety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, seeing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the measures which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesire of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encouraged in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they confidered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind clogged by one terribleness after another. The incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapablo of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had assumed a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining played itself on the appearance of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, he inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherence became more frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, which first his companions observed, when several hours into the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awshome a situation, whc his sister was going next day to be married. Instantaneously. Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of his mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be preserit at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but waited a few minutes. He said his sister was with him. He was apparently again guilty of being affected by the influence of her affection, for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing from the thought of her brother's being more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the woman who had so long occupied his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression on his countenance, he bade her swear that she would not wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turried suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guard and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a retum of his disorder, entored, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning afler the drawing-room, and had been refused with no one else. When he heard of Avrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those from whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the bride and interest in his fate, he gradually won the affection of Mrs. Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with another being on the crowded earth, save to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or what was the will of fate, that he gained her affection. The title of the elder brother falling at length to him, he offered an important engagement, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before her departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physioian and his friends, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their bride and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heauy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubrey, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest in the confines of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of some terrible preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages hooke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the prisoners at last overcame their vigour, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he made immediate approach, and, taking his arm by force, hurried away from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brother to day, your sister is honoured.\" Women are frail!\" So soothing, he pushed him towards his associates, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not having subsided, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near prospect of death. He desired his sister's guard flags might be omitted, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had suddenly appeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the house with a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, were to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecetic Coast Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1892, we put into the harbour of Mitylene in the island of the same name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ship's bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cove called Homer's School, and other places, which we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belonged to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six shundrod zechines for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not always; for he sails in his boat very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all perfectly decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble lables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a large fountoin beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning post; a large ochouch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bedchamber was merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large recess, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Schapcline's, Boileau's, and Rovsseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klapsloek's Messiah; Kotzebue's novols; Schjller's play of the Robbers; Millon's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Groek press at Constantinois, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with remarkable notes, written with penmanship, in Hebrew and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been read.\"\nHe had these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought back from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen feet wide, and the fluted masonry pilasters with half-ack plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considered somewhat higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone bolustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, known as \"lachryma ehristi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn his left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large oak hushes, a marble scat with an ornamental wooden back wall, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till nearly eleven o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I supposition,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, except Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covored with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Grange temple appeared in majestic splendour. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smoothes out, and an arch, surrounded by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of lofty chesnul oaks and palm-traces, several smeltlands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the town we learned severances of the imprisoned lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gives a cow to one man, two others, and ootton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from what we observed, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstantial circumstance we must mention, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and given her herself the use of it.\nSuch was the infernality with which we parted from the peaceful Isle of Messina; our imaginations all on the run, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had much, it was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arriving at Parma, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Milylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the name of Charles in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we confoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some other day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not wholly uninteresting, and in respect to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to assimilation with human nature, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the contrary, as may be plainly gathered from these dates. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat. He took his son in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to govern all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Rellgion hath set her seal, and over whose head Buckingham hath thrown her mantle. No one can read the preceding pleasuring \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with contempt, particular when directed against man's moral irrigrity; and he who dares justify himself for that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errands of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is wholly of his genius. Trying to do good in yourself, and shun the world's applause, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet.",
    "41": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very common in the East. In the Arabians it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could riot violently if married in their territory, it gradual increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with a slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speciously died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckors fathered children, and their veils became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular occurrence of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they posilively and unanjokingly affirmed, that, about five years ago, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassiopeia, on the fringes of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre; for, about twenty or thirty days aftor his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulled the body, they searched it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) free from contamination, and entirely free from strangulation, and emitting from the mouth, nostrils, and ears, fresh and world blood. Proof having been thus obtined, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried as dreadfully as he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents against others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person seduced by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his own turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrance must not be relatived, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observatories than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to make his infernal visitations exclusively to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, your corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the life out of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at night drain the stream of life; Yet from the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy vicars, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing the flowers, thou seeing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one day for thy children must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's love, that word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's first kiss, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the ends of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when her Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is but away from thee the Mountain of thine agony! Yet with thy own best blood shall drip; Thy gnashing teeth, and haggard lip; Be stalking upon thy sullen grave, Go, and wither Gouls and Afrits rave, Till the crowds in dread shrink away from spectre more acrimonious than they they.\nMr. Sovthey has also introduced in his collection a beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful nature of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The unfortunate Tournant gives a long account in his travels of several astoriishing cases of vampyrism, from which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, comprising a variety of accounts, and traditionary descriptions illustrative of its effects, has put forth some valuable dissertations, tending to prove it to be a scientific, as well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly bad superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mere remarking, that though the monster Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it in various parts of the world: of Vroucocha, Vardulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attending upon London winter, here appeared at the various parties of the lodgers of the regiment a man, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could riot himself therein. Apparently, the light laughter at the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness resided. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the oblique face, did not seem to cease, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the skull; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In consequence of the dead hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the bluish of modesty, or from the trong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were unmistakable, many of the female hunters after him attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every gentleman she met in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of mourning, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as though they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But although the common objections could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virginal wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that he Even though many overcame what they read of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their virtue through their domestic virlues, as among those who sully it by their vice.\nAbout the same time, there came to Lyon a young gentleman of the name of Aubroy: he was an orphan left with only sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left alone to himself by guardians, who thought their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruined many milliner's apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and though he thought life was brought in by Providence inerely for the pleasure of the scene, as we say in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of elothes, which were woefully insufficient warm, but which were better represented to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fact, that the dramas of poets were the joys of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving who should describe with least truth their languishing and roping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening expressions when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon induced him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached to what he knew to be the rornance of his sister's rooms, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the preserice of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of placing pictures and defcriptions contained in those boxes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation for his gratisied vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary occurrence we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of extemal objects, than the unquestioning assent to their existence, induced by the avoidance of their negative character: allowing his imagination to picture everything that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he thus formed this character into the hero of romance, and endeavoured to observe the course of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advertised upon his notice, that his prescence was always recurred. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. De Sirovs of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which had been postponed. Many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid stops in the career as vice tawards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and thus allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They communicated, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his loyalty to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gratefully accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the censors.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lard Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, when many more of his associates were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than they required to meet their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the poor, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attending even upon him, that he beslowed his alms; these were sent through the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his troubles, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the uirtuous indigent. There was one circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, instantly found that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the caffold, or to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his company searched for the centres of all sasbionable vice; there he entered into the spirit of the game table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rosh youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numrous family; then his very wish seemed to defy fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the most affluent youth, far from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungoon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fellow sat frantic, amidst the peaking looks of hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to sustain their present habits. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this could not be the result of a certain degree of knowledgings, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to reproach this to his friend, and beg him to withdraw that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own position; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; but, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst many wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubroy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in good attendance upon the royal circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sifter, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guards, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his father, and said that his character was dreadfully vicarious, for that the possession of irresolute powers of seduction, rendered his lloentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been concluded, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her companion; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be behurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of vice and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to exposito the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a sombre bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumferences pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and so perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the intimacy of the daughter of the lady whoso house he chiefly governed. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his career in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Rutbven, and abruptly made him his interitions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Roberts answered, that his intentions were such as he supposed she would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired, and immediately writ-ten.\nWriting a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other engagements, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspendant of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and so occupied himself in trocing the faded rocords of classical glory upon monuments that apparent.\nSome, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hid themselves beneath sheltering soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as M'Bataet himself, existed a being, so beautiful and dellcate, that she might have formed the perfect model for any painter wishing to place on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradiso, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced upon the plaje, or tripped along the mountain side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apperently the eye of animated nature, for the sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of artificial manufacture. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kewmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letter he had just decyphered upon an almost effused tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she fussed around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before bought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which we all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balms. Whilst he drew the remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and witness the effects of his passion, in tracing the scenes of her former place; she would then describe to him the closing dance up on the open plain, which she would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she remembered having in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would tell him the mysterious tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the imagination even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amassing his friends, and dearest ties, fattened every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the erring masses, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but they clung to him then chiefly of old men who had at last detected one living among them, after several of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and breaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of these monstrosities, and his joy was aroused, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he worried at the strange coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Harriet; her innocence, so contra-ted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of European habilf, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almost foiry form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins before him, whilst in his mind he retained on image that seemed the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was uneonscious of his life, and was evidently the same frank infantile being he had formerly known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragrant which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeoled to her parents on the subject of Vampires, and they both, with scrupulous propriety, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the description of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must noessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the regiment of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgief, and denounced the most heavy violence as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made some of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, inferior power, the very name of which apporently commanded their freedom, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off on his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his hoft, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his harse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of these charms to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon his devoted counsellor. He at last mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and although he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its thundering thunders gave scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightnings seemed to fall and dance at his very feet. Suddenly the horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful reluctance through the entangled forest. The animal at once, through sheer satigue, slopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to take shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he progressed, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the droadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the witness, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and ho felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed beyond human: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeing upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating throvgh the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he immediately rose, and, following his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the bronches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now raging, and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the brick walls, and the smoke loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conduetress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, strangled by his sleeve. There was no colour upon her cheek, nor upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the night that had dwelt here: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having entered the wound:–At this the men pointed, crying, and simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy vision, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his future held.\nAs his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held most voluminously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by diffused parties who had been engaged in the fear of her whom a mother had missed. Their considerable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most virulent fever, and was of a most delirious; in the latter engagements he would gaze upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ian–by some unaccountable comination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. Atother times he would recall inaledictions upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athenf, and, from whatever reason, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was borrified and startled at the sight of him whose appearance he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kindwords, implying a most repentance for the folly that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, concern, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his present condition. His lordship seemed suddenly changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious intent playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but it had always haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the prevailing breeze, or in marking the progress of the sun's rays, circling, like a mirage, the noveless sun.\nIn deed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and the elanicity of spirit which had once sustained him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and filence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athen; is be sought it among the rinks he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought it in those woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in the quiescence of the modest violet; the trees suddenly turning red, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded body, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every scene, which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which recollection could be attached: but though they hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard of robbers, but they gradually began to doubt these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they deferred from pretended enemies. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guide than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring preexpices, they had no opportunity to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had rushed towards them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report come. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the great turn of the defile: but aware of being thus pursued by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and meet them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Rutbaven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was surprised by seeing the robbers' faces round him–his guards baving, upon Lord Ruthven's being wound, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their conduct–they being content merely to guard the entraice till their comrade should return with the promiscuous, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; in two days considerable convalescence ensued, and he seemed proceeding with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the evening, his mind was apparently unresponsive, and his eye oft en fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer him assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"HARD?\" Tell me how? \"I need but little–my life is empty–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my happiness were free from the world's mouth–and if my whereabouts were unknown for some time in England–I would take my life.I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"It must be known. –\"Swear!\" exclaimed the dying man, rising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your very fears, and by a year and a half you will not impart your knowledge of my sickness or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see!\" His eyes seemed hursting from their sockets: \"I swea!\" said Aubrey; he sprang laughing upon his pillow, and breathed in more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the company, when the robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him.\nHis lordship and comrades, upon his retiring, to the palace of a neighbouring mourning, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and throw it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had placed the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that pervasive melancholia that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. Whil waiting far a vessel to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him be going to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to the use of the victim. There were several dogs and ataghans. Whilst watching them over, and admiring their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornately decorated in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shoped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the blade and shoath were alike in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to meet, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to rescue from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, her fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deposition of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken from so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady would fall a victim to the destroyer of England. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation remained in urging the speed of post-incisions, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English seas; and he hastened to the mansions of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and embraces of his sister, all memory of the post. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affections, but that the woman began to appear, she was still not interested in attaining as a companion.\nMRS. Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up with the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, which appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light fluttering, which sometimes a bterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother gave to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the court, it having been thought by her guardians more than once that her presentation should be deferred until her brother's return from the continent, where he might be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the occasion of her entry into the \"big house.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable dressers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own happiness to the pratection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had riot been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corrier by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the recollection that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place—he fell himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Rehrember your oath.\" He had hardy courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre which would blaft him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on his first entry into society. He struggled till his limbs almost refusing to bear the weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing passage through the crowd, ho threw himself into a carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried stops, and fixed his eyes upon the floor, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his mouth. Lord Ruthven again besore him–circumstance is started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that he could be real—he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concurrence with Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining uniformation. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near family on. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apperently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass through and get near her, when one, whom he compelled to move, turned round, and revealed to him those habits he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself surrounded by a crowd of servants who were waiting for their meals; and while he was engrossed in passing them, he again heard the voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been entirely absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certitude of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was disturbed. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his home, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? He if very much might have been touched by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and confirm his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the woman from such a wright; but death, he remembered, had been altogether mocked. For days he remained in this state; locked up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and seclusion, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly the image which haunts him.\n-ted him. His teeth became contracted, and he struggled, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recovered; at first he returned with the ovening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever he could overlook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, urged people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he had by his absence the whole of his friends, with a few amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscous, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approach with intimacy. But when he entered her room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a fociety which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unauailing, the guardians thought proper to intervene.\nFor, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of rescuing him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye any marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice him, so completely was his mind occupied by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confirmed to his chastisement. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only feeling of affection and recollection remaining manifest itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would something snap, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflict her, he would desire her to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, do do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a stupor, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherence became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its meaning, whilst his guardians observed, that feveral times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan up to the melancholic circumstance of Avrey's being in so awful a situation, when the sifter was going next day to be married. Instantly Avrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of reliving intellect, of which they believed he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that the groom was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his father. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently quite capable of being affected by the insluence of her lovely features; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her neck, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted wisdom, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguised for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, so great was his surprise at beholding the foatures of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He seized the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and buried it under soot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing upon her with a foul expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, unless he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned sudden round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought that this was but a repetition of his disorder, entered, and finding him with Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing the infanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the prisoner after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readied himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this infamy. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brothel and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? He had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded street, except with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing calls; in fine, he knew so well how to use her master's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in view of her brother's deronged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardian, attempted to rob the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the hope and the hope of their house, to forget but for a few hours that marriage, on which he hurled the most heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the habits of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubroy heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of some terrible preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew increasingly frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the purse, which one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately appraached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not in your bride to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are sick!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his associates, who, watched by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, he had broken a blood-vessel, and he was carried to bed. He was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Landon.\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he described composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardian hastened to protect Miss Avbrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Russell had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was upon him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Georgian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's uosseans, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—hoth meri of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, on the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had beer. On the brow of Mount Ida (a majestic mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an Englishlord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would take me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malta, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, commanding the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, five hundred shillings for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided here about four months, but not long; for he sails in his felucca very often to the distant islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in havingtering to the house where our countryman had occurred. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain grecn-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountains beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a large mattress.\nShe spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble chest formerly, the old man told us, filled with hooks and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shokspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmell's, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Rhubbers; M'Ton's Paradis Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; sixteen small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, and no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, some of which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to do one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; but be is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings, of which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was displeasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the finuted marble pillars wth black plinings and fret-work cornices, (as it is now known in Grecian arcitecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a lattice stone balustrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of fine linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the loft hand as we entered the house, a small stream flowed away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an arnamental woaden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till two o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to him friends. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for him was very devoul, \"and always attended our house twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this spot was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye towards Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream arising from the ruin descended in shuddering cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a sin gle cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through avista of lofty chesnut and palm-traces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I felt more joy at finding her than I did at his; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in their romantic seclusion: I did not know his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenlon,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fellow?\" I said, \"If I come,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls whon He was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and coltan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a florist who had loft his own in a clle, and he often gave Greek Teslaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very decent and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought prudent not to disclose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was oftenseen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught himself the use of it.\nThat was the ease with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man, our imaginations all over the rack, guessing who this rambler from Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthrophy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palerino, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been on travelling in Egypt and Groce, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tonedos, and I last visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been only years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the use of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylene on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I rate this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and injustice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be palpably gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their home in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling prouder of him than a clergyman. With respect to his habits or pleasures, I do not consider a right to give an opinion. Reporters are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dare to defend himself before that extraordinary tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest mark of a virtuous heart and felf-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillel, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "42": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Powell\nTHE circumstance upon which this case is decided is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief prevailed, that prisoners nightly imbibed an extensive portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and suffered from constipation; whilst the human blood-suckers fattened and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a most interesting, and, of course, credible account of a particular occurrence of violence, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the coin-mander-in-house and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certinado Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, there at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; and, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, any persons complained of having been tortured by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his hands. To prevent further outrage, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corrvption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they reforted to the accustomed custom. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Pavl, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been shot. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into a grove. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously suffered from violence, that they should, in their turn, become employers of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChicfORD.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is well related, because it seems better adapted to the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punished death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to complete his earthly visilations so as to pay homage to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on Thursday, as Vampyre sent, thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; The ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, and wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must flow from thy livid living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou musting them. The flowers are wilhered on the stein. But one that for thy crime must falter, The youngest, best behaved of all, Shall blossom with a father's name—That word shall wrap him in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glossy glance must view Whose face freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's sondest pledge was worn– But now is borne almost entirely by thee Memoria of thine agony! Yet with your own best blood in your mouth drip; Thy gnashing teeth and bleeding lip; The stalking to thy sullen grave, Go, and with Gossips and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from persons more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but charming poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyric character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is regarded as having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tremort gives a vivid account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of onecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some earned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be found; though the present article will suffice for the limits of a nate, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyrcy is the most common in medical and scientific acceptability, there are several others synonyms with which it is made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Grosul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened in the midst of the dissipations attending.\nOn a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparenty, the light loughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by a quick quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, or at any rate to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin and could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; many wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In consequence of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of rudesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though his farm and outline were beauliful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:—though in vain: when she stood near him, though her eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But though the common adultress could not influence even the judgment of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was unfavourable to him: yet such was the apparent cavtion with which he spoke to the unfortunate wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dreod of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent halcyon of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their superior virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, here came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan lad with a young sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who did their duty morally to take care of his fortune, but while they relinquished the important importarit charge of his mind to the regiment of mercenary soldiers, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He seemed to sympathise with virtue, and thought that violence was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that jealousy of a cottage mere supported in the vesting of clothes, which were as worm, but which were better adapled to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of children were the real joys of life. He was handsome, smart, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least description their languishing or romping habits: the daughlers at the same time, by their brightening countenances whom he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, so led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the talow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those boxes, from which he had formed his study. Firiding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the sheer impossibility of forming an idea of the crime of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the callous indifference to their appearance, implied by the avoidance of their closeness: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object into the hero of a romance, and determined to abserve the offspring of his passion, greater than the person besore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Rulhven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the rates of preparation in High Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whetled his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the tour, which had been postponed. Many generations has bought necessaries to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, when some scandalous incidents are mentioned as the subject of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. The case was concluded, and Arnold immediately mentioning his loyalty to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Rutbven's character, and now he found that, though many more of his actions were exposed in his view, the result offered different consequences from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liborality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than was advisable to relieve their immodiate wants. But Avrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his want, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This circumstance, however, attested by him to the greater impartunity of the intelligent, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was one circumstantial about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom he was bestwed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the west and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aury was much coveted at the apparent ease with which his companion sought the crowns of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always succeeded with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unfailing face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of a numerous family; the very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat which was dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the habits they adorned, oursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn them within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenſe wealth, wherewith he could even provide enough to satisfy the most pretences craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediate lost, to the ruiner of many, the last giver he had just snotched from the convulsive grasp of the innocents: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. He had wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charley and pleasure which provcd the habit of alI, and did not tend to his own profit; but he declined it–for a day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and among the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from the cousin excitement of vainly wishing to break that melancholy, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of an almost deserted city. Wilst he was engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager curiosity; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residont in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of resistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangorous in society. It had been discovered, that his passion for the prosecutrix had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation; and, in fine, that all those persons whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virlue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their characters to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not shown a single bright spot to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the meantime, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work up the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is exceedingly that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. In no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being asked whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assault was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspension of his plans having been foiled by Auhrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his slepf towards Glasgow, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenaeum. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded record of ancient glory upon monuments that evidently, ashamed of chronicle the deed of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many ooloured lichen. Under the same roof, however, existed a being, so delicate and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour out on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, but that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to the world which had no souls. As she danced upon the plough, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the girl a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxurious look of the lady suited to the last tastes of an epicure. The light step of the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and of late would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttersly, show the whole beauty of her form, fluttering as it were in the wind, to the indifferent gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effaced tablet, and the coruscating of her sylph-like figurine. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibiting in the sun's ray such delicately brilliancy and swistly fading hues, which might excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?—It was innocence, youth, and excitement, unaffocted by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future children, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pericil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open ploin, which she would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the inarriage procession she remembered witnessing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a great impression upon her mind, would toll him all the supernatural tales of her youth. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Avrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a young female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his heart would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living creature themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so jubilant, she begged of him. He did not believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which induced them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was untrue. She detailed to him the tradition and appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in reproaching her, that there could be no truth in her fears, but at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the superintendant power of Lord Rutherven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to the girl; her innocence, contrasted with all the offected virtuosity of the women among whom he had fought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idleness of a young man of Engllish habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still remained himself nearer and more attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian restoration, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained on image that regarded alone the rightful possession of his thaughts. He was uneonscious of his life, and was ever the same frank infatuated being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in searching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vauxhall, and they both, with several professions, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Hurrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they at once begged him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. He described it as the repetition of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and described the most heavy omen as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. He made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very thought of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy mood of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the folly of those criminals, were true.\nSuch fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night alowed the power of these beings to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his search, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the war-torn climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devastated country. He at last, bow ever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but he was to late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is most unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was upon him–its echoing thunders had come within an interval of seconds–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to foll and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he carried with dreadful rapidity towards the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped.\nHe went, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the lown, or at least to provide shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the furious shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mackery of a laugh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He heard himself in utter distress: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, though he called, still the sounds ceased, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a volce cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength soemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemythrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon his chest, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glare of many torches penetrating through the wood, that gave way in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, which broke through wood, was no longer heard. The fire was now out; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was still heard by those without. They entreated; the light of the torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy coats of soot. At the desire of Aubrey he scarched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches came more intensely upon him, to perceive the airy form of the fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hapering that it was but a vision arising from his deluded imagination; but he again saw the same creature, when he unclosed them, slouched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to which the men pointed, crying, simultaneously filled with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly farmed, and Avrey was laid by the side of her who had latey been to him the object of so many joys and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was engaged on and off reflection, and seemed roving in vacancy–he held almost unconsciously in his hand a nakcd dagger of a peculiar shape, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her, whom a woman had identified. The lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inseparable; both died broken-bearted.\nAvrey being put to bed was seized with a most virulent fever, and was ostentatious; in frequent intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon God, and by some unaccuritable combative combative conduct he seemed to beg of his former companian to spare the being he loved. At other times he would place precariously on his head, and curse him as a destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Atheris, and, from whatever motive, upon bearing of the state of Aubroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became ill.\nThe attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrifled and started at the sight of him whose image he had now occupied with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impinging almost repencence for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxieties, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Avrey; but as soon as his convalescence seemed to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malignation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was appeasement.\n-I was deeply engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the collision.\nIn marking the position of those orbs, circling, like our own, the movable sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitaire and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solace, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he searched it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, nothing but a form stood by his side—if he searched in the woods, her light step would appear wondering across the underwood, and quest out of the depths violet; then suddenly turning red, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face on a wounded state, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such terrible associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in a circuit, and sought every spot to which a recollectian could be attached: but though they thus hopped from place to place, yet they seemed not to remember what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were almost the invention of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from threatened dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the safety of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, howcver, a narrow defile, the middle of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rubbish brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had to repent their negligence; for scarcely wore the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the excited report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left him, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had gone to sit in the direclion whence the repart came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advice, and being exposed to continuing slaughter, if any of the robbers saw them above and followed them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer in the contest or at his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and having agreed upon a ruse, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade would return with the promised food, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days martyrdom ensued, and death seemed ceasing to take his steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, he came apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I meld not my life, I heed the death of an existence as terrible as that of the passing day; but you may save my bonour, your father's bonour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but life–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknown far some time in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by your greatest fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes against death to any living being in anyway, whatever may be.\nPens, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" So said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey resumed his rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attonding to his acquaintance with the prisoner rose upon his mind, and he know not why; when he remembered his oath a coolly shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by servants and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey followed, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, although the robbers swore they pointed out the ideritical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten that superslient melancholy that had seized up his mind, he resolved to leave it, and so made his arrival at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging some effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, some or all adapted to ensure the death of the victor. There were several daggers and ataghons. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curiosities, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be intensified when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainly—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the fame varying tints upon the haft and sheath were like in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rochester, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthvon's seduction arts. Her parents were in distress, the family fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his ship. Aubrey's mind became almost overwhelmed with so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this child had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He was insensible and silent; and his only interest consisted in urging the speed of the positon, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed contrary to his will, soon wafted him from the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and here, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embroces and caresses of his sister, a memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caressings, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching as companion.\nMiss Auhrey had not yet won that prize which gains the cheers and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was some of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was on that light footing, which is where you see a butterfly. Such a colour may attract—it was sedate and pale. When alone, her face was never brightened by the pleasure of joy; but when her brother spoke to her his affections, and would in her presence forget those feelings she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for the sorrow of his life? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her governess more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, whon he might be her protector. It was now, however, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was now approaching, should be the epoch of her engagement with the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel intrest about the frivolities of fashionableness strangers, when his mind had been clouded by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxiously to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all about him, engagled in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice, which he recognized well, said in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with burried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath.He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few days after with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protoction of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own depraved thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, led her towards the passage: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, reached home.\nAubrey became almost dislocated. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, but much more completely was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's murderous intent pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she intreated him to explain to her what had caused his abominable conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those tormented her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to rise, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. And if he were to break his oath, and declare his suspicions, who would believe him? For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besaught him, for her sake, to support nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and soliloude, he left this house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His habits became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever satigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by himself the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscionous, he determined to enter into society, and watch him closoly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, of his danger. Whom Mr. Rulhven approached with intimacy. When he entered into a room, his haggard and sullen looks were striking, his inword shuddering so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, a society which affixed him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians felt it proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they bought it big time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wars, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take consular care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence was at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would ofter lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become completely emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would suddenly start, and, seizing her hands, with loins which had formerly afflicted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him! Is your love for me for aught? Do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! True!\" Again he sank into a desponding state, whence no one could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind grew off a portion of its gloom, whilst his friends observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite numbness, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attrocted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they merited the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubry seemed pleased, and astonished still more by his pressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insluence of her lovely smile; for he proceeded her to her breast, and kissed her cheek, which was wet with tears, flowing from the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguised for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, he was overwhelmed with surprise at beholding the features of the man who had so long influenced his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then clasping her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of maintenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not agree–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he suddenly became frantic, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the mean time the guardians and physician, who had hoard the whale, and who thought it was but a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desisted her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken hold of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called themorning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his fiancee, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for his brother and apprehension of his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tolls to recount–could not speak of himself as of an individual having any sympathy with any being on the known earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were mercifully that he might listen to her soothing accerits;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. The titlc of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse for postponing the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but a few days that marriage, on which he denounced the first heavy curses. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he bought it better not to harass any more of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the poor inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard a horror that may more easily be concoived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the noise of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servitors at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an elderly woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the house, speechless with rage. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my birthday, your sister is disowned. Wonton are frai!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendents, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken out in flames, and he was conveyed to bed. This was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was accused of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he described nearly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guards hastened to protect Miss Aubroy; but when they arrived it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecjan Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put in at the harbour of Mityene in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cottle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and mercantmen; and though it lies rather out of the way for ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties offer repoy for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser trading for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's Schol, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scotland with an English man, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he paid Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in proceeding to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a large bronze Venus in a loaning posture; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen Eriglish eane chairs, and an emply book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a fingle painting. The bedchamber had just a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the cammon bodoughs taken from Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, formerly, the officer told us, filled with baoks and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousséau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much lorn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with notes of praise, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been recolding these books the evening before he sent, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie unturned; for he is so porticular, that were I to move one book without orders, he would frown upon me for a week to come; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm far the trouble of taking care of it, except twelve shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black plinths and frel-work capitals, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, supported by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus ruined, and upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating frittat, and enjoying the evering breeze.\nOn the left hand side of we entered the house, a small stream glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nighls till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyardſ led the eye to Mount Colcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestical decay. A small stream issuing from the mountain descended in broken cascades, but it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an hour-glass unshaded by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a watch more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless in finding the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell.\" I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can't you tell, my friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on our return to London we learnt some particulars of the isolated place. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horsesto others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a watch for a man who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very kind and benevolent character. On a circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shores, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her to make the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceable isle of Mityleno; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, but it was evident: he had peculiarity of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were discounted. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architecl, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" sold he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of the lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands we recognised the likeness of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we resolved ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on same future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with any man or creature, or contributing in any way to sooth its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Defence, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of happiness is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whose heart Roligon has set her seal, and upon whose head she holds. Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasuring \"trajts\" without feeling proud of him as a courtholder. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with cautiori, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal whero all must appear, alone may censure the error of his fellow-mortals. Lord Byron's companion is worthy of his gratitude. To do good in society, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prunter, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "43": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common; it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latins and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that the Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the living and beautified. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nighty imbibed a certain quantity of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fatten up, and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nThe London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, that they positively and unarbitrarily affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovla, on the frontiers of the Turkish Seruia, he had been thrusted by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the poison, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This prevention, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and accusation was made, that some persons had been deprivated of their livelihood by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consigned their horses, to pick up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. Proof having been thus abtclosed, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the hearl and body of Arnold Pclul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been killed. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the children of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre bocomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous crime is here related, because it seems better represented as the subject of the present observances.\nMore than any of her evidence which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for same heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only subjected to vampirism, but compelled to commit his infernal visits so often upon the beings he loved most while on earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Pope sent, thy corse shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the native place, and suck the life out of all thy creatures; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streain of life; Yet from the banquet which perforce must feed thy living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless her with a father's mercy! That will wrap thy cart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glaze must view which gives her life its lifelike blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in a lack of shorn affection's fondest pledge was worn; But now is borne on way by the Memorial of thy clony! Yol with thine own best will drip; by gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy secret grave, Go, and with Gouls and Anglesrave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful prose of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting the man she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sins of her life, she being represented through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The voluble Tovrnefort gives a long account in his travels of some astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary descriptions highly suggestive of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, attempting to prove it to be a scientific, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be odded; but the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, which may now be concluded by inerely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several terms synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vrovcolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Buccoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIt happened that in the midst of the disturbances attendant upon a Lambeth meeting, there appeared at the royal porties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed vacantly around him, as if he could not participate therein. Appropriately, the laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by good look quell it, and throw fear into the breasts where thoughtlessness resided. Those who felt this sensation of chill, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the prisoner's face, did not seem to pulse, and at one glance not pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin so much it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be called to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violence, and now for the sake of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which had lately gained a warmer tint, either from the weight of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after his notoriety attempted to win his affections, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had made the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a merchant, to attract his notice:–though in vain: when she stood before him, and his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the room. But although the common adultress could not influence even the judgment of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: so such was the apparent cautery with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his infamous hatred of vice, he was as often among those femalef who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan, and had an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, when they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many music's apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that judgment was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of the cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various peculiar patches. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the reallties of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, and his entering into the gay circle, many men surrounded him, striving to determine which one he would descriminate. In truth he was languishing or roping fools: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening appearances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened them, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except for the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the presence of a gas, but from the act of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing picturcs and deserters contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his habits, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the impossibility of forming an opinion of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observance of external objects, than the tacit consent to their existence, implicated by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slanted into his propensity to cravagant ideas, he formed this object in the mind of a romancer, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recogriised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affair were involved, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desired of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his guardians, that it was time for him to persist the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the wheel of vice without putting their fate upon an equal footing with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasurable or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, be gratefully accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, as many more of his acts were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives behind his conduct. His conduct was peculiar in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggor, received from his hand more than enough to last.\nThey believe their immediate wants. Mr. Hurrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendent upon him, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring boshfulness of the voracious indigent. There was one circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that here was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the soaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject mifery. At Brussels and other low points through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he remained.\nHe had in all the spirit of the game: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash you.\nIf you were a fortunate novice, or the luckless father of a large family; then your wish secured fortune's law; this childish abstraint of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn from the company he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the foulness which had drawn him with the fury of this fury; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute and ungry children, with but a single farthing from his late wife's purse, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he made no money from the gambling game; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledgability, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey of Len wished to represont this to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which had proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, he was never afforded. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst many wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyes spoke less than his lips; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubroy for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affections; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon him immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that the character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possessian of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratification, that the female, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not protected him.\nLed to expose the wretched deformity of their vicars to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon marrying one, whose character had not yet borne a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lord'ship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly required. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried woman is met with in society; he was thus compelled to carry on his plan in secret; but Aubrey's eye follawed him in all his windings, and he soon discovered that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely result in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intention with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to murder her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were sincere, as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely lavished. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a not to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed marriage, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assignation was prevented. LATEST. Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's intervention.\nHaving left Rome, Avrey rected his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, found himself near Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of ancient history upon mounds that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the object of a painter wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could give meaning to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain side, many would have thought the gazelle a peculiar type of her beauties; for they would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated passion, for the sleepy luxurious shape of the animal suited perfectly to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the often assisted Aubry in his search after irregularities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who memorized the letters he had copied upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like form. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the viewer's eye such curiously brilliant and swiftly fading hues, which might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the things which he had before thought of vital import as to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pclusanias. But why attempt to defraud charms which we all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, you know, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the ragged effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pamp she remembered vicwing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him about the supernatural deeds of her nurse. Her earnestness and ardent belief of what she narrated, excited the admiration even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living phantom, who had passed years amidst his friends, and darefully, forced every one, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence through the erring months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of her idle and borrible santasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who have at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relations and children had been found marked with the stamp of the creature's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been proved, that all those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was almost extinguished, by bearing a pretty acerbate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of L0rd Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her joviality, so contraslated with the offeoted virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his object of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself attached to the almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, following a recommendation from some antiquarian rescarch, he would depart, promising not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. He was unconcerned with his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She sometimes seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was clear that she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, when her guardian was occupied in searching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructions of the lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed her innocence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon afterwards, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must neeessarily pass through a wood, which no Greek would ever reach, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as imperiding upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubry made some of the representatives, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very power which apparenlly made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, moeking the belief of those horrible creatures, had inspired them with such terror. Whon he went about making his confession, she came to the side of his chair, and earnestly begged of him to return, for night allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his task, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spockets which, in the warmer climatics, rapidly gather into a tromendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, however; mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the pummeling of the storm was above—illustrations echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heather rain forced its way through the canopy of foliage, whilst the blue forked lighning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangling forest. The monsoon at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of decayed leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least to offer shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the slifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in one almost uninterrupted second; he was startled, but, roused by the thurgeon which again roared over his head, be, with a sudden effort, forc open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; when he called, all the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found him in communication with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Again broken!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glarc of many torches penetrating through the hole that went light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, following his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Avrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by others talking about. They entered; the light of their lantern fell upon the mud walls, and the room loaded on every occasion with heavy flotsam of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again lest in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, he could perceive the unmistakable form of his fair conductress lying in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same man, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed as attached as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the girl, who had lately becn to him the object of so many quarrels and foibles, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts wore–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun refleclion, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almast unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a paralular construcion, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of someone whom a molher had missed. Their lameritable cries, as they approached the court, forewarned the parents of a dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Anne, and rushed to the house. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would throw himself upon Lord Ruthven and vice versa, and by some unaccuritable cambination he seemed to beg of his former compunction to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate curses upon her head, and curse her as her deserter. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed him himself in the same house, and became his chief attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and slurred at the sight of him whose appearance he had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutledge, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxieties, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begon to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of inaljcious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this sensation haunted him. During the last session of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apperently engaged in watching the tideless wavcs raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the positions of those orbs, circling, like our world, the noveless sun;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the rvins he had formerly frequented, the form would appear surrounded by his enemies; if be sought in the wood, her right step would appear wandering about the underwood, in quest of the first violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded hands, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every one of which created certain associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they hastened from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard many reports of robbers, but they subsequently began to doubt these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of individual, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from pretended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the ambassador, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow defile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a river, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their mistake; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow passage, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant his guards had surrounded them, and, hiding themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insuiting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in pursuit of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a blow in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer hearing the contest or his own companions, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring castle; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–the latter being cont ent merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days much consternation ensued, and death seemed advancing in a hasty step. His demeanor and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uncoriscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of last evening, his mind became apperently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubrey, who was compelled to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my acquaintance as much as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"It shall not be known.I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I can not explain the whole–but if you would disclose all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my deeds were known for some time in England, and–I—I–but life.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or deeds to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he fell laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nHe retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstance attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his return, to the prison of a neighbouring county, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it would be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning which rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mourned at the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the interesting rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was wildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothe.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such torrible misfortunes, and in which all apparenlly conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy that had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and on arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Ortranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulham. Amongst other things there was a chest containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to occasion the death of the victor. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, who was in surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined. He discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shapod, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty—they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular features, the varying tints upon the hft and sheath were like in splendour on him, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way hoine, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Rutbaven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's heart became almost broken under so many repeated occurrences; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victor to the destroyer of Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his companions persisted in urging the speed of the postilion, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to him, in the elegant caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine cocks, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more important as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and admiration of the drawing-room decorum. There was none of that light brilliance which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feigning wiliness, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a colour might attract—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was nover brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother bore to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed her life, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardian more fit that her present appearance should be delayed until her brother's return from the Oratory, when he might be her protector. It was then, however, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the point of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancolic wealth of his father. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, whose minds had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced in a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastenied thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engclosed in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by a chill, and a voice be recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs first refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his throat–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the decensed rise agair!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be recovered; he decided, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to learn concorning Lord Rutbven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining information. He went a few nights with his sister to the assistance of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave herself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found the sifter surrounded by several, appareritly in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he compelled to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang for his ard, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of seruants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard the voice whisper close to him—\"Remain sober your oath!\"He did not dare to turn round, but, hurrying his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the prisoner's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt collapse. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his life, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been threatened by him. But even if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besaught him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became degraded, and he was considered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer able to be recognized; at first he resumed with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxiously for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dispersed by him, who fled from a pursuer more than any from thought. Hisconduct, however, suddenly ceased. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose reputation they were unconscious, he determined to belong again in society, and watched him closely, anxious to forebear, in spite of his oath, who Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into the room, his haggard and suspicious eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to obstain from seeing her.\nHe left, for her sake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that rule which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they consider folly, they had engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He scarcely appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed in one terriblesubject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had hardened a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recrimination remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seaming her hands, with looks which severably afflicted her, he would desire her not to sit down. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom be referred, his only answer was, \"True!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rause him. This lasted several months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his inquiries became less frequent, and his mind threw off a pall of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to confer with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a state, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to come. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently capable of being affected by the intensity of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being ever so alive to the foibles of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage to a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, what was his surprise at finding the features of the monster who had so long inflamed his life. He seized the purse it in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it underfoot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then, tying her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this monster, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the governess and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother into the drawing-room, and had been resused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and happiness could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gleaned this information. He hasened to the house of his former companion, and, by regular attendance, and the pretences of great concern for the brothor and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Avrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recover; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earlh, except with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, is it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or such was the will of fate, that he desired her affection. The title of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an importarit embassy, which he served as an excuse for having the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his deporture for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe his servants, but in vain. He took out a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, consoling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he inflicted the first heavy curses. The servants promised they would destroy it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any man the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a lunatic. Night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparatory. Morning camo, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Avrey grew more frantic. The curiosity of the seruants at last over came their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hand was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Reinstate your oath, and know, if not my brother to day, your sister is dishonoured.\" Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not letting vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his brother, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom must leave.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guordians might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related exactly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. LATEST. Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, he was to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of M'Illelle in the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British soldiers to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrna.\nThe bounties amply repay for the damage.\n-ation of a voyage. We landed, however, at the mouth of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the serjeant bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave surrounded Homer's School, and other places, where we had bccn before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his felucca. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Groek, \"and would have to know me to marry him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I was likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage on the bank, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, two hundred shillings for it, (about £250 English value,) and has resided there about fourteen years, though not constantly; for he is in his habit of very frequent visits to the different islands.\"\nThis occurrence excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all simply decorated: paneled green-stained wools, inarble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and small fountains.\nThere beneath, which could be made to play through the house by moving a spring fixed in the side of a large bronze Venus in a leaning position; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no medals, nor a single painting. The bedroom had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillaw—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble desk, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and paper, which was then in a large seaman's best in the claset: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the receipt lay Vallaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works compote; Volney's Ruin of Empire; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopftock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Sohiller's Paradise of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian editor, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was largely scribbled upon, and marked with flips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that should I to move one thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together.\" He is otherways very good. I once did him a service; and I had the produce of the farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechines which I gave to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty feet long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars with black planking and fret-work carnices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was supported by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking hard wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the first morning as we entered the house, a small breeze glided away, grapes, orchids and limes were clustering together on the borders, and between the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, upon which we were told, the lord passed many of his hours and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church five days a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird-eye view.\" A line of rich vegetable gardens led one eye to Mount Carmel, covered with olive and myrtles trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins flowed in brooches, until it was lost in the woods near the mounlain's base. The skull was smooth as glass, and an hour-glass.\nOn the right, unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnats and palms-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more when I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in his romantic happiness: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said the officer, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fart?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenjan, but on our return to the country we learnt some particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was lost upon the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he osten gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we learned, to have been a very eccentric and benovolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage ought proper not to disclose. He had a beautiful daughter, with whom the defendant was often seen walking on the sea-share, and he had bought her a piano-forle, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rock, guessing who his rambler from Greece could be. He had money it was clear: he had philanthropy of disposition, and other ecclesiasticalities which mark his singular genius. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled.\n-lled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the arcitect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I last visited him at Mylene.\" We had not previously heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being pressed into our hands we recognized the name of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our inquiries at the coltage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylene on some special day; but for me that day will never return. I read this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which had been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, with regard to associating with wilful nature, or contributing in any way to sooth its woes, or add to its plunder. The fact is directly the reverse, and may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer details.\nThe feelings of the heart, so eloquently described in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tonderness, fympathy, and chority appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being on whom heart Religion has set her seal, and over whose head Berievoence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasuring \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are ever to be received with much concern, particularly when delivered with reference to man's moral inlegrity; and who dares justify himself before that extraordinary tribunal where all must appear, one may be sure the errors of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's companion is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving consciences.\nTHE END.\nGillot, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "44": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. From the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the latter becoming prevalent, because a Latin body could not cross if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful legends, still extant, of the dead rising from their groves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and spoedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened up, and their insides became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, dated March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hurghary. It appears, that upon examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been called to say, that at Casanova, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had become tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and bathing himself with his blood. This prevention, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischievous, the inhabitants having consented their removal, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting from the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and lustrous blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stakc was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, turned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the corses of several persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who received them.\nThe universal truth is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous spectacle is here described, because it has been adapted to illustrate the subject of the present observations better than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment beyond death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, the deceased.\nHe is not intrinsically doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to make his infernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affection and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vainpyre sent, thy soul shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly be mustit the place, and suck the blood of all thy race; From thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the pool of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living cells, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing me; By flowers are withered on the stem. But one day for thy crime must fall, The youngest, hest beloved of all, shall strike thee with a father's rod—That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her face's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which sways of its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall trace the trosses of her long hair, of which, in life a lock when shorn Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is stripped away by thee Military of thine agony! Yet will be thine own blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sister grave, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Till these in horror shrink away from spectre more monstrous than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild hut a beautiful poem of \"Thaloba,\" the name of the Arabian princess Oneiza, who is reputed of having retumed from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sins of her life, she being viewed through the whole of the world as a complete type of purity and irinocence. The veracious Tremort has had a long acquaintance in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and tradtionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has produced some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting things on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in first genera accepted, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various meetings of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he might by alight quell it, and strike fear into those breasts where thuggishness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain why it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance penetrate through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were relieved at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strangulation of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his affections, and show, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the inockery of every man shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:–though in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her, still it seemed as if they were unappalled;–even her unfappalled impudence was blotted, and she left the field. But though the common adulation could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female race was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparition cautiori with which he spoke to the fearful wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a wicked tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an unmarried sister in the posse of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to him by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his mind, while they relinquished the more important charge of his health to the care of mere administrative subalterns, he cultivated more of his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that high roguish feeling of nobility and candour, which daily revirs so many milliners' apprentices. He believed himself to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was brought in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the genre, as we see in pictures: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adopted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of children were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay courts, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping habits: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into confidence of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the roinance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of lighting, there was no foundation in real life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his school. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to resume his dreams, when the unfortunate occurrence being above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibilily of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observance of exlernal objects, than the total assent to their existence, accompanied by the avoidance of their contours: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the object of a romance, and determined to observe the springs of that passion, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him compliments, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrased, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker Street, that he was about to be removed. Deceased on gaining some information respecting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many years has been necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting them themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, owing to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intent to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from man, who, apparently, had much in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few moments they had passed through the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunty of staking Lord Mayor's character, and now he believed, that, though many of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His conduct was profuse in liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the heggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. Mr. Aubroy could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuosity, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms;–these were solicited from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the prosecutor came to ask him something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by some to the greater importuriity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the rottering bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was circumstance about the charley of his Lordship, which was still more impressible upon his mind: but those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon them, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or to the lowest and most abominable misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his company sought for the centres of all foul vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the far-off tabernacle: he struggled, and always succeeded with success, except when the known barper was his antagonist, and then be lost ever more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally waded the society around: it was not, however, so when he identified the rash youth of a numerous family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluent youth, torn from the circle he hadorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn them within the reach of this fiend; whilst a father sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of his hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling tab, but immediately lost, to the ruiner of money, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this must be the result of a certifiable degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey of course wished to represent this unfortunate friend, and beg him to resign that charity and measure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in the carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of life, was much the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater pleasure from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something superriatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italjan countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of a most deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager joviality; the first was from his sister, bearing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had been entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, the letters seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guards insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his companion was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that the cantemptor of the adultress had not acted in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his gratuitous satisfaction, that her victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsulliod virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fact, that all those females whom he had sought, apperently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown away the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose character had not yet found a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, promising, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and lo let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to prey upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chief ly frequented. In Italy, it is feldom that an uninarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but a curious eye followed him in all his windings, and there discovered that an arrangement had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing time, he entered the apartment of Mrs. Ruthven, and abruptly asked him his intention with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to intimate her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have agreed upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, mercifully laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the continuation of their proposed tour, he directed his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify his accomplice assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Aegean Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of the prisoner. Greek-arid soon occupied himself in trawling the faded records of annals upon monumerits that apparently, instead of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or marmalade lichen. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicote, that she might have formed the model for a painler wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have changed her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleopy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light of day often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the vivacious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole body of her form, floating as though it were upon the wind, to the admiration of him, who forgot the letters he had just decyphered upon an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her hair, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's rays such dolorous and swiftly fading colours, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to prescribe charms which all feel, but none appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unafsected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and witness the magic effects of his passion, in tracing the scenes of her former life; she would describe to him the circling darice upon the open window, was would paint, to him in all the glowlng colours of her happy motherary, the marriage pomp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him the supematural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, he smiled dejectedly.\nIn such ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his enjoyment in the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her off of such idle and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of old men, who had at once dejected one living among them, after several of their near relatives and children had been marked with the stamp of the fiend's appelite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their accusation, always had some proof given, which begged them, with grief and breaking, to confess it was true. She described to him the traditional appearance of the monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a remarkably accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, though all the same he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so consonant with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found him-\nHe became more and more attached to the almost fairy tale before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian refearch, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible not to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, which first in his mind he regarded as an object that seemed alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same infantile creature he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or examining some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they had, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detour for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, until the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described the resort of the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most horrid evils as impending upon those who dared to cross their path. He made light of their reproachations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which opposedly made their blood freeze, he was appalled.\nNext morning Aubrey set off on his excursion unattended; he was surprised to behold the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horribles, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for she had allowed the power of her enemies to be put in effect; he promised. He was, however, so excited in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was a flash of those speckles which, in the warmer climates, rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these circumstances.\nThe power of the storm was above–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick black smoke forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Such weather, in temperate climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced for, the power of a storm was upon him. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through strangulation, stopped, and he heard, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a house that had lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least to abtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the deceased.\nThe loud shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a lavagh, continued in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: and, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden attack, forced open the door of the house. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apperently unperceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in company with some men, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried, \"Agnus basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he found himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman; determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemythrew himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat–when the glore of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed towards the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the window, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the glow of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the batch loaded on every individual straw with beavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a life-threatening condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visiion arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, or even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwell there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the mark of some hoving upon the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror,\"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyr!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had lately borne to him the promise of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held most unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been sound in the hut. They were so met by different persons.\nThose who had been engaged in the employment of her whom her mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe the circumstances would be impossible; but when they certified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and rushed to the corse. They were inseparable; he died broken-hearted.\nUpon being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often delirious; in those intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Miss Henderson; by same unocountable combination he seemed to beg of his solitary companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would inflict maledictions upon her head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever recollection, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyro; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying almost compensation for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. He now seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Ayre; but as soon as his convalescence seemed to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Ayre perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this image haunted him. During the first stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the prevailing breeze, and following the progress of those orbs, circling, like the world, the moveless spot;–indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroy's integrity, by this shock, was completely weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light shape would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; and suddenly turning round, would appear, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should enter those parts of Glasgow neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and saw every spot to which a recollection could be attached. But though they thus hastened from pace to pace, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they believed were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they protected from prelended dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on every occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow passage, at the base of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring mountains, they had reason to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves upon rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering ranks of the cavalry: but accused of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts bade them advance, and being exposed to unresisting slaughter, if any of the robbers should come above and strike them in the rear, they determined at once to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the roek, when Lard Ruthven received a shat in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the noise or the peril, was soon surprised by seeing the rabbers' hands around him—his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aury soon induced him to convey his wounded friend to a noighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortisication ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last engagement, his appearance became apparently uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Auhrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I need but little–my life ebbs and flows–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and my death were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life.I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, regaling himself with exuberant violonce, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart any knowledge of my crimes or death to any living creature in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed to burst from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillows, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose up in his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his son a cold shivering came over him, as is from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a rober met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had made his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cald ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey became distressed, and taking several of the merlons, determined to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, although the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered by these conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse beneath the pile of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appearances conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy which had seized up his mind, ho resolved to leave, and so arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing sixteen different articles of offence, more or less intended to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and ataghans. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he shuddered—hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may he imagined when he discovered that it fitted, but was peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing directly to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the samo varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductivo arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of India. He became melancholy and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Clerkenwell; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English resorts; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, through her infantine earesses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room attendants. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was constantly lit up by the louity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy melancholy about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footwork, which strays where a butterfly or a colour may attract—it was sedate and pensive. When she awoke, her face was nouer brightened by the smelt of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and who in her presence forgave those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the governor? It seemed as if those eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her prayer should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he would be her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remained in the mansion of his father, but fed up with the melancholy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fanciful strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comforts to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of joy, had come thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engclosed in a remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly dared to turn, fear of seeing a pistol that would blast him, when he perceived, at a considerable distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs most refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and farcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paoed the room with hurried steps, and fixed his bands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven stood before him–circumstances started up in disorderly array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was dwelling upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the question hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining any information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a near regiment. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he returned into a recess, and here gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many were loaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apprentrently in engaged conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most dreaded. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, forced her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of soldiers who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey became almost distrocted. If before his mind had become absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attentions were now vivified, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and then terrisied her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath startled him; was he then to allow this monster to come, bearing ruin upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very father might have been confined by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to save the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and was only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to suppor nature. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roaming from street to street, anxious to fly from the image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned in the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His master, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dispersed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any from before. His conduct, however, sufficed.\nHe has since changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend among them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn, in spite of them, all whom Lord Ruthven appraised with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his baggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward slowness so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her fake, a society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrations proved unnecessary, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again the trust which had been before imposed upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufforings he had dally encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly appeared to not think about it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. By he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attached a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflict her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" And there he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his appearances came less frequent, and his mind threw off a pall of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had near elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physicall upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so owful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished them still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely sister; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockel up against her breast; opening it, was his greatest pleasure at beholding the features of the monster who had so greatly influenced his life. He placed the portrait in a pocket of rogo, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he had destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he laughed as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him repeat his oath–he turned sudden round, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, entered, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay him for a day. They, attribting this to the insincerity they believed had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had refused with every one of them. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readly understood him to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasurable could not be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constable attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to recount–could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had come to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing voice. In fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's art, or perhaps it was the will of fate, that he desired her affections.\n-N.S. The title of the elder branch falling close to him, he obtained an important embalming, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in consequence of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the cantonment.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to report the sermons, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those nameless in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he had announced the most heavy curfes. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed without rest to the busy atmosphere of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may more easily be conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. Mornig came, and the sound of carriages broke up his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of a young woman. He seized the opportunity, with one hound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were similarly assombled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by farce, hurried from the room, speechless with rage. When on the foot-case, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Rejoice your day, and know, is not my bride to day, your mistress is dishonored. Women are frail!\" So saying, he directed him towards his attendances, who, roused by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer contain himself; his rage riot finding vent, had broken out in blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he examined, as the physician was afraid of upsetting her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be communicated, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related much what the reader has perused–he died shortly after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubre-\nHer sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, but he must choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, an old haunt of his Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain fupply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both merchantmen and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships bound to Smyrria, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the summit of Mount Ida (a majestic mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Marylebone, where I am now to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dornick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £50 English currency,) and has resided there about four months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\nThis account entertained our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a small closet annexed. They were all simply designed: a green-stained wall, marble tables on each side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning post; a large cauch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bedchamber had mercifully a large mattress placed on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bed across Greece. In the sitting-room we found a marble recoss, farmerly, the old man told us, silled with books and papors, which were kept in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think our selves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Bileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmermann, in the German language; Klopstack's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, produced at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the period. Greek medals at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with memoirs, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must remain until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I did him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The principal was fifty paces long and fourteen feet broad, and the fluted marble pillars with balustrades and fretwork cornices, (as it is now customary in Greciari architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was supported by a sine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of thick coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fresh fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large laurel bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till two o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in brooks cascodes, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a sliver cloud, dominates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a visage of largely chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue water with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in his romantic orbit: none knew his name but Minick, his bariker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armeniari,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old friend?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt some particulars of the isolated lord. He had courted eight young girls when he was last upon the land, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, borsos to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and was often heard sending telegrams to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we regret, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all over the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those ecclesiastical entricities which mark peculiar genius. Arrived at Palermo, all their doubts were dispel. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelligating in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Messina.\" We had never heard of his lordship's fame, and he had been many years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcis in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we cornered ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in justice to my lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to soothe its sorrows, or add to its pleasvres. The fact is quite the reverse, as he plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so clegantly depicted in his lordship's pooms, see to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and chivalry appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a being whose heart Religion hath set her seal. Over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"lraits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loues or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he must justify himself before that awful tribunal where all men appear, alone may censure the errors of his fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's attention, is the surest testimonial of a virluous heart and self-approving disposition.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "45": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very germy in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be extinct: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming popular, that a dead in body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formcd the subject of many wonderful stories, still extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a considerable portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of consumptions; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a point of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passageways of their bodies, and ever from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 32, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a peculiar case of vampyrism, which is said to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain occurrence occurred.\nThe prisoner, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Travaille Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This caution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a menace himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emilting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the commonly prescribed remedy. Astake was driven almost severally throvgh the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and carried the ashes to his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously suffered from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief Justice.\nThis monstrous robbery is described, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the foregoing observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his irisernal visitations solely to those beings he loved most upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre spirits, your corse shall from the tomb be rent; Then ghastly baunt the native place, and suck the blood of all thy race; There from your daughter, sister, wife, and children drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed the living corse, Thy victims, when they yet expire, shall know the demon for their soul; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flowers are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall strike thee with a falher's knife! That word shall wrap thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark Her cheek's first spark, and the last glassy glance must view which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with unhallowed hand shall tear the locks of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock of shorn Affection's fordest pledge was worn; But now is borne away by the Mother of the agony! Yet with thine own best blood shall drink; Thy gnashing loath, and haggard lip; Then stalking down thy sorrowful grave, Go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these horror shrink away from spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his wild but beauliful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneizcl, who is represented as having been relurned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him for being best loved whilst in existence. This cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life, being presented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The ueracious Tovrnefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classic error, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstilion must be compiled; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, purely devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several names synonymous with it, and in use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the various parties of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the world around him, as if he could not participate therein. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, that he endeavoured by a loath to quell it, and throw force into those breasts where thoughtlessness resided. Those who felt this sensation of awe could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, or at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weigbed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him. He invited to every house all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt a feeling of ennui, were pleased at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly look of his face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its features and outline were exceedingly beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his attentions, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every gentleman shewn in drawing-rooms since her inarriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the gloves of a movable bank, to attract his notice:–though in truth, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her own, still it seemed as if they were unperceived;–even her unappalled impudence was deplored, and she left the field. Bt though the common adultress could not induce even the slightest interest of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet so was the apparent conduct with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or whether they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among those females who form the boast of the sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAt the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great unwillth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Lit also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, whilo they relinquished the important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more of his imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily struck so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was brought in by Providence mere for the picturesque effect of the courts, as we see in romances: be thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He bought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the realilies of life. He was handsom, frank, and curious: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters in the same lime, by their brighlening countenances when he approached, and by their sporkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false impressions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except for the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no room in his life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, upon which he had formed his study. Finding, however, no compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have just described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an opinion of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, besides the tacit indifference to their existence, was plied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to picture any thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of his romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learnt that Lord Russell's affoirs were embarrased, and soon found, from the manner of preparation in which they were destroyed.\nHe feared that he was about to lose his life. Desirous of gaining some inforination respecting this singular character, who, until now, had only whet his curiosity, he hinted to his guardian that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations had been thought necessary to en able the young to take some rapid steps in the care of vice towards putting themselves into an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the skies, whenever disastrous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill required in carrying them on. They agreed, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from a man, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Russell's character, and now he found, that, as many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the facts offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that this was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indignity by the misfortunes of life, but upon the impotent even up an virtue, when he bestowed his alms;–these were sent from his door with hardly suppressed fury; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still further in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed to the greater inportunity of the fortunate, which general prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was another circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was heftowed, inevitably sound that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either either thrown to the scaffold, or sunk to the lawest and the most abominable conditions. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gained with success, except where the known sharper was his adversary, and then he lost more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless father of a numerous family; then his very wish soemed contrary to fortune's law—this apparent abstractedness of mind was laid asid, and his eyes sparkled with more furtive than that of he eat whilst dallying with the half-dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluents.\nHis youth, torn from the clothing he adorned, cursing, in the manner of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst his father stood frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, with which to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Then he took some money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to convey this to his friend, and urged him to designate that charity and pleasure which provod the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it, for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of life, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lips; and though Avrey was near the object of his affection, he obtained no greater gratificotion from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to know that mystery, which to his cowed imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companions; he left them in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in fear of the memoranda of another almost deserted city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which corresponded with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardian; the latter distressed him; if it had not previously entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residerit in his company, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belittlement.\nF. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that passession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his immoral habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his coritempt for the adultress had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had obtained, to enhance his gratification, that she, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, down to the lowest abysm of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all the females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of the vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey cried upon leaving one, whose companion had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no sight circumstances pass unnoticed. He entered in the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he formerly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his winding, and soon discovered that an assizes had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. In no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him to express his affection with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his intention to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven and witnesses.\nHe said his intent were as he supposed all would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he had no confidence accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assizes was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely sent his servant to notify him of his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been soiled by Avrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avbrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peloponnese, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in traoing the faded records of ancient glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaves, had hidden them themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many coloured stones. Under the same circumstances as himself, exifted a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a paintor wishing to paint on canvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomel's paradise, save that her eyes spoke too clearly for any one to think they belonged to those who hod no souls. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor creature of her beavties; for he would have exclaimed her eye, apparent as the eye of animated passion, or that sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of her often accompanied Aubrey in his search after treasures, and often would find the unconscionable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kamere butterfly, how the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eagle gaze of Aubrey, who forgot the letters he had just decamped upon an almost effused tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like form. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's rays a delicate appearance. Brilliant and swift in fading hues, it might excuse the forgetfulness of the author, who let escape from his mind the very object he had been thought of as having vital importanceto the proper interpretation of a passage in Pavonis. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but few can apprcciate?–It was innocence, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawers.\n-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those pictures of which he wished to preserve amemorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic strokes of his pencil, in tracing the outlines of her native place; she would then describe to him the circular patterns upon the apen plain, would paint, to him in the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage parties she remembered viewing in her youth; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, wha had passed years amidst his friendf, and dearest ties, foroed every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong its existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of such idiotic and horrible fantasies; but then she cited to him the names of old men, who had at last detected the living creature themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their evidence, always had some proof given, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these moristers, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all contributed to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vices of romance, won his heart; and while he disparaged the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he sound himself more attached to the most delicate creature before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-varian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that seemed alone the sole possessor of his thoughts. He was unconfcious of his love, and was ever the most infantile man he had ever known. She always felt compelled to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, when her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Chambers, and they both, with solemn present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the ugly name. Soon after, Aubrey compelled him to proceed upon one of his inquiries, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to return at night, as he must necossarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. He made light of their representatives, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at him daring thus to call a superior, infernal power, the very name of which immediately made their blood freeze, he was unable.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, for he had last night allowed the power of these beings to be put in effect, he protested. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country. He at last, howcver, mounted his horse, determined to make up some speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night comes: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was great–its echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest–its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was corried with dreadful reluctance through the entangled forest. The animal at last, throgh fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glarc of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead loaves and branches which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain sheller from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mookery of a man, accompanied in one loud unbrokering sound; he was startled, but, roused by the thunder which almost rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, haunted him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he called, the meetings continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized, when a voice cried, \"Again he has struggled!\" To which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed beyond description: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his seat and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his assailant threw himself up an bim, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat when the glare of any torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now raging, and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those with him. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakcs of soot. At the door of Avrey they searched for her who had alarmed him by her cries; he was again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more reached him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless corpse. He shut his eyes, hoping to forget. It was a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the shape, when he closed them, stretched out on his side. There was no colour upon her face, not even upon her lip; yet there was a strangeness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that dwelt there: upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein: to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was left by the side of his wife, who had longly been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, and struggled with the flower of life that had died with her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almast unconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a military construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her whom a mother had missed. Their lamentable conduct, as they approached the city, alarmed the public.\nThey speak of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed him towards the window. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was often dolirious; in these intervals he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some peculiar combination he seemed to beg of his former comportment to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maledictions upon his head, and curse him as his destainer. Lloyd Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Alhens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of a man whose image he had once combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbaven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the foult that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite composed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his conviction began to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey received no difference from the former, except that occasionally he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recuperation, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the prevailing breeze, or in marking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun; and, he appeared to wish to avold the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elastioity of spirit which had once so distinguished him seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for happiness, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amidst the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in quest of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to fly scenes, every feature of which created such bilter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus moved from place to place, yet they seemed not to remember what they gazed upon. They did not think much of robbers, but they gradually begon to slight these robberies, which they imagined were only the creation of individuals, whose object it was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from preterided dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guldes than as a defence. Upon entering, however, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had reason to repent their negligence; particularly were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behirid rocks, had begun to fire into the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, retired for a moment behind the sheltering turn of the defile: but as afraid of being thus detained by a foe, who with frequent shouts bade them advice, and being expased to immediate slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they determined at once to run forward in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shelter of the rok, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heeding the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a respectable cab, and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their conduct than they being content merely to guard the corridor till he heard they would return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decosed; in two days mortification ensued, and death serenely occurred with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had riot changed; he feemed as unconscious of pain as he had been before the occurrences about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uneasy, and his eye oft en fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his company with his usual address—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unkriown far some lime in England–I—I—but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exultant violence, \"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all you nature fears, swear that, for one year and a day, you will not impart knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his knees, and suffered no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shivering came over him, as if from the premonition of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first rays of the sun that rose after his departure. Aubrey astonished, and toking several of the men, decided to go and bury it on the spot where it lay. But, when he had mounted the suiting he found no trace of either the corpse or the clothes, though the robbers swore they pointed out the geological rock on which they had left the body. For a time his mind was lost in conjunctions, but he at last returned, convinced that they had broken the windowse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had acquainted with such terrible misfortunes, and which all apparenlly conspired to heighten that superstitious melancholy which had seized up his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offer.\nHe more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several burglars and atags. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curling forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered it.\nHe noticed that it filted, though peculiarly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet not wholly he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendor on him, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on him.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Romford, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were deceased, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deportation of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that the lady had fallen a victim to the depravity of Ianthe. He became morose and filthless; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breech, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaining as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning smile which gains the gaze and applause of the drawing-room audience. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded auditorium. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind beneath. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling with which, that appeared to jostle a soul conscious of a brighter future. Her step was not that light footing, which strays where a butterfly or a crow may approach—it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget those griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed as if those eyes on that face were then playing in the light of their own luminaries. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardions more fit that her presentation should be preceded by her brother's return from the continent, when he met her protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, would be the epoch of her entrance into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the mansion with her falhers, and fed upon the melancholy which overpowered her. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so tormented by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to provide his own comfort and the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been converted as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time–and all who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrances of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvenos in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognised too well, whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly courage to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would blast him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot upon his first introduction to society. He gazed till his hands most refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried stops, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances slarted up in dreadful alarmly–the dagger–his throat cut–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had made up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be possible, for he determined, the day before, to go about in civil society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung up on his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining any agreement. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assombly of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring thoughts. Pleading, at last, that many were leaving, he roused himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, appareritly in engaged conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most abhorred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried steps, led her towards the street: at the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he again heard that voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn round, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey bocaine almost murdered. If before his mind had been absorbed by one senseless crime, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon him? His sister's appeals were now unheeded, and it was in consequence that she intreated him to expain to her what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His oath started with this: was he to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruin upon his breath, and all he held dear, and not avert its progress? His very soul must have been destroyed by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his secrets, who would believe him? He thought of taking his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, whose eyes were straining with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support nature. No longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which baunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to thenoon-day sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; he must first be returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest when his fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dispersed by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any.\nHe thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Stricken with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose preserice they were conscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closly, anxious to forewarn, in spite of his enemies, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, and his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from watching, for her sake, a circumstance which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unsatisfactory, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to resume again that trust which had been before imposed upon him by Aubrey's representations.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physic practitioner in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was consined to his chamber. There he would often lie for days, in constant fear of being raped. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affliction and recollection remaining played itself upon the entry of his sister; he would hear something start, and, seizing her hands, with eyes that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to fall down. \"Oh, do not touch him! –if your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! true!\" Again he sank into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months, but gradually, as the year was passing, his incoherences became less frequent, and his mind took off a portion of its gloom, whilst his guardians observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a fortnight, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his servants entering his room, began to converse with his physician upon the melancholy circumstance of Avrey's being in so awful a position, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met with in society, Aubrey became excited, and astonished them still more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desiririg to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insuition of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to him, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother being once more alive to the pleasure of every creature. He began to speak with all his wanted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her breast; opening it, he felt his surprise at bebolding the features of the woman who had so long influenced his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus discovered the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he would not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenance, he made her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again made him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Rulhven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disease, entered, and sorcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay it for oneday. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refusod by no one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastoned to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the appearance of great affection for the brother and interest in his fate, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his pawer? His tongue had dangers and troubles to recount–could speak of him as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself;–could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents;–in fine, he knew so well how to use the serpent's tongue, or such was the will of fale, that he gained her affections. The title of the elder branch folling at length to him, he obtained an important position, which served as an excuse for hastening the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the bride and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he had declared the most solemn vows. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey with what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a borror that may more accurately have been described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning come, and the number of carriages broke up outside. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at once became too great, and they all stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, seizing his arm by force, hurried him from the room, speckled with rage. When they reached the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your father is dishonoured. \"You are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, surrounded by the old man, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer suppert him; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not known to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and groom left Londondan.\nAubrey's weakness increased; the esfusion of blood praduced symptoms of the near opproach of death. He feared his sister's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related exactly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guards endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all for him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN Sailing through the Grecian Archipelago, on board one of Messrs. Meyer's veils, in the year 1812, we put into the harbour of M'Ille, in an island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce nearly any British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track of ships bound to Smyrna, its bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyago. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and whilst the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a rainble round the cave and Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) we met with a young man named Greck as our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island some days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Malta, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six bundles of zechincs for it, (about £250 Eriglish currency,) and he resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he failed in his duty very often to the differerit islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We then received an old man, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground-floor—an entrance ball, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed room, with a spacious closet enclosed. They were all simply decorated: plain green-stained walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountains, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a lever fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large couch or sofcloth completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single pointing. The bed chamber had a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pilow—the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a marble recess, somewhat, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were kept in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess lay Voltaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Vaughan's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a penknife, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and marked with flips of paper, on which also were remarkings.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books on the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"thero they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very gung-ho.\" I once did him a favour; and I have the whole of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house extornally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fifteen broad, and the fluted marble pilasters with black plinths and fin-work cornices, (as it is now called in Grecian architecturo,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roaf, supported by a light blue balvstrade, was covered by a fine Turkey carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus fumished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christl,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand side of we entered the house, a small streamlet glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, arid under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a rarble seat with an omamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord possed many of his evenings and nighls till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to friends. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout,\"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the window was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcis, crowded with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic splendour. A small stream issuing from the ruins dejected in broken cascades, and it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The surface was smooth as glass, and the horizon unshadowed by a fine cloud, obscuring the view in front; and a little on the left, beyond a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-traces, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald greenery. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name except Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fart?\" said I—\"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt several particulars of the isolated lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even danced with them at the recent feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cottan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a shoemaker who had lost his own in a gale, and he gave Greek Testamen to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to disclose. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her to make the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Man; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had in everything it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar characters. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about who you are so anxiously, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedof, and I last visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some distance from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the name of Calcla in the back page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Marylebone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite unimportant, and in justice to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as of an unfeeling disposition, indifferent to associating with human nature, or conlributing in any way to sooth it's troubles, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, seem to have taken their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and bearing the repose of solace is an additional reason for marking him as a being whose heart Religion had set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence had thrown her mantle. No one can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reports are to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dread to defend himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a feline-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest mark of a virluous and scler-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "46": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA Tale.\nBy John William Polidori\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present forms in the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not corrupt if buried in their territory, gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonders and stories, still extenuating, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and maiden. In the West it spread, with same slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the lies existed, the vampyres invariably imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedlly died of consumptives; while these human blood-suckers became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madrcyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and other officials of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been beard to say, that at Cassovia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grave, and drinking himself with his blood. This preeaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his deceased burial, several persons complained of having been tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his actions. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be found in oases of vampyrism) fresh, and almost entirely free from corruption, and omitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Proof having been obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven almost severally through the heart and brain of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cringed as dreadfully as if he had been alive. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agenies upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his victims.\nCrown bailiff.\nThis monstrous robbery is here related, because it seems better adapted to illuminate the subject of the present observations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in office, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but condemned to can fine his infernal vices solely to death. Those whom he loved most while upon earth–those to whom he was bound by lies of kindred and affection–A supposition alluded to in the \"Gentleman's Review.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre spawn, your corse must fall from its tomb and rent; Then ghastly haunt the native pace, and suck the blood of all the race; There from thy daughter, sister, wise, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loathe the banquet which perforce must feed thy livid living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, must know the demon for their sire. As cursing thee, thou cursing them, thy heads are wrenched on the desk. But if that far thy crime must fall, The youngest, beloved of all, shall bless the child with a father's name—Tho word shall wrap thy hoart in flame! Yet thou must end thy sorrow and mark her cheek's last tinge—her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must be mustiew which freezes over its lifeless blue; Then with your own hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, Ilfe a lock when her affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is thrown away by thee Memorial of thine agony! Yet with your own best efforts, go; Thy griashing tooth, arid haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, go, and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these in the mirror shririk away from spectre more accursed than they.\nMr. Southey has also produced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the vampyre character of the Arclinian maid Orieiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the finfulness of her life, she being represented throughout the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his memoirs of several infamous cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variety of anecdotations, and historical narratives illustrative.\nIn consequence of its effects, has put forth some lengthy dissertations, attempting to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on his singularly horrible superstition inight be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanation, and which may now be concluded by mercifully remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, here are several others synonymous with it, made use of in a varied part of the world: as Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goule, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the difsipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the frequent parties of the loader's on the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the scene around him, as though he could not participate there. Apparently, the light laughter of the sair only attracted his attention, that he might by a quick quell it, and throw fear into those hearts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, gazing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the hearl; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden ray that weighed so much on the skin it could not pass. His peculiarities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had become accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of unease, were pleased at having something in their possession capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the dour hue of his face, which gradually gained a warmer tint, either from the loss of modesty, or from the long emotion of passion, when his form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after notoriety attempted to win his affection, and gain, at first, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every man shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, thrust herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his notice:–thougb in vain: when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceivod; ever her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But since the female adultress could not influence the direction of his eyes, it was clear that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his appearance of vices, he was as often among those females who form the boast of their own domestic virtues, as among those who justify it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, Thomas met with a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was scarcely eighteen, and left an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who considered it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the most important charge of his mind to the core of mercenary subalterns, he cultivated more imagination than judgment. He had, hence, that high romantic feigning of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprenticeships. He believed all to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Pravde merely for the picturesque effluence of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the prisoner's eye by their irregular solders and various coloured patches. He knew, however, that the dreams of children were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, in any mother favoured him, striving which he could describe with least truth their immoral or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he clasped, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the regiment of domestic hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles which flickered, not from the pleasure of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no fire. He never read any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriplions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Finding, however, some compunction in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dream, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impudence of forming an idea of the character of a man enlirely absorbed in himself, who gave no other signs of his observation of external objects, than the lax assent to their existence, imputed by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination on to picture every thing that flattered its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this image of the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his presence was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was unfit to travel. Desirous of gaining some information from meeting this singular character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he intimated to his friends that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to induce the young to take some rapid steps in the career of vice towards placing themselves upon an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if they were from the clubs, whose scandalous intrigues are frequently mentioned as the subjects of pleasantry or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to marry him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHitherto, Ayre had had no opportunity of studying Lord Russell's conduct, and now he said, that, though many more of his acts corresponded to his own, the results offered different conclusions from the opparent reasons for his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon virtue, that he bestowed his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to enable him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich chivalry. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunty of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring benevolence of the virtuous indigent. There was one concern about the charity of his Lordship, which was still very improssed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, evidently found that it was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at his apparent eagerness with which his componion set sail for the centres of fashionable ville; there he entered into all the spirit of the table: he botled, and always gambled with sullenness, except where the known sharper was his antagonism, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging ardour, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the rash youthful navicc, or the luckless father of a large family; then his very wish seemed fortune's law—the apparent abstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more colour than that of the cat which was first dancing with the half-dead man. In every town, he left the formerly affluent neighbourhood, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of the dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat frantic, amidst the spouting tongues of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his own immense wealth, wherewith to buy food sufficient to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling lable; but invariably lost, to the ruiner of many, the last goods he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combating the cunning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resolutely renounce that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit; but he delayed it–for every day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and apenly to him; but, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich fountains of nature, was always the same: his face spoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratisication from it than the consternation of vainly wishing to break that mystery, which to his excited imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another unfortunate deserter.\nThe city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with great impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing not only affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his habit, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for the possession of irascible powers of feeding, rendered his liceritious habits more dangerous to society. It had been determined, that his contempt for the adultross had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to enhance his notoriety, that the victim, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullied virtuc, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all those femmes whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the full deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon leaving one, whose prisoner had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean time, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lord Mayor was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is seldom that an unmarried female is met with in society; he was thus obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon concluded that an assignation had been arranged, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the office of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being bound to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have been on such occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a letter, to say, that from that moment he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordhip. The assault was prevented. Lord Roberts on the next day merely sent his serjeant to notify his complete assent to a sepclaration; but did not raise any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Avrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athenaeum. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of an extensive gory upon monumerits which, apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of men only before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sagging soil or many coloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter bidding to pour tray upon tray of the promised hope of the faithful in Mahomet's paradise, save that her eyes spoke to much too much for any one to think she could cheer those who had no hope. As she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle of poor description of her habits; for whould have had exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animally inclined nature, for the sleepy luxurious look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ian the often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscionable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttorfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgave the letters he had just decyphered upon an almighty effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she slitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hue, it might excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could not escape from his mind the very object he had before thought of vital importance to the preparation of a passage in Pausanias. -But why attempt to describe horrors which all feel, but no one can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and happiness, uninfested by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling stalls. Whilst he drew those remains of whom he wished to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magi effects of paint, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dunes upon the open plain, would paint him in all the glowing colours of youthful memory, the marriage pomp she recalled viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects which had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living monster, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, when first he attempted to laugh her out of idle and horrible fantastical tales; but she cited to him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the marks of the fiend's oppetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof given, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to believe it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by bearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persisted in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered at the many occurrences which had all seemed to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Russell.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Marie; her innuendo, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached to the almighty fairy form before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the rightful possessor of his thoughts. He was acutely aware of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile being he had first known. She always seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no longer any one with whom she could occupy her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pealing with horror at the very name. Soon afterwards, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the noise of the pace, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remonstrate, after the day had closed, upon their consideration. They descrihed it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most violent evasions impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey heard the laughter of the representatives, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a super-insernal power, the very name of which apparently made their hearts freeze, he was silent.\nNext morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the raucous face of his host, and dismayed to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible spirits, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged of him to return, as he had allowed the power of the supernatural beings to be put into action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the boreizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, so rapidly gather into a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climes, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above—its beating throngs had scarcely an interval of rest—a thick heavy rain forced its way through the ever-opting foliage,whilst blue forked lightning soemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, under the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbour's garden of a hovol that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brush.\n-ood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the tawn, or at least to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, contrived in one long, unbroken sound; he was startled: and, roused by the thunder which again roared over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unwell; for, though he was called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a man cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seomed superhuman: determined to sell his life as quickly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feel and hurled with enormous force against the ground:–his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeing upon his breast, he placed his hands upon his back–when the glare of many torches penelrating the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him;–he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the wood, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud wolls, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the desire of Hurrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her call; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a visitation arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no blood upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stilness about her face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once dwelt there: upon her neck and chest there was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of the knife having cut the vein: to this the men sprang, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A little clot was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had long been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now filled with the flower of life that had died within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacanoy–he held almast conspicuously in his hand a naked dagger of a peculiar construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of someone whom a molher had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of a dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were inconsolable; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a most violent fever, and was of course delirious; in these intemperate circumstances he would throw himself upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe; by some unaccountable combination he feemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would make imprecise malodictions upon his head, and curse him as her destainer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at that time to arrive at Athens, and, from whatever motive, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and startled at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Rulbven, by his kind words, implying almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, concern, and affection which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence begto be resumed, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference. From the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed interitly upon him, with a smile of malicious enjoyment playing upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile had untied him. During the last portion of the prisoner's recovery, Lord Routhven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of distant orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avert the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished him now seemed to have fled for ever. He was now as much a lover of salitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amid the ruins he had formery frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he sought in the woods, her light step would appear wandering amidst the underwood, in a manner of modest vivacity; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild irnagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile on her lips. He determined to fly clearances, every feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the greater care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece no one had yet seen. They searched in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they moved from place to place, yet they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to doubt these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of iridvidvals, whose interest it was to excite the generality of those whom they protected from pretend dangers. In consequence of thus neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as a defence. Upon entoring, however, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brought down from the neighbouring precipices, they had to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the whistling of bullets close to their heads, and by the echoed report of shots.\nNo guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment behind the shetering lough of the defile: but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with insulting shouts had made his advance, and being exposed to immediate slaughter, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they desisted at once to rush for cover in search of the enemy. Hardy had they lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, not heeding the contest or his own prudence, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon induced them to convey his wounded friend to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their presence—they being content merely to guard the entrance till their comrade should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly decreased; in two days considerable violence ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of pain as he had been of the horrors about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparent and uneasy, and his eye often fixed upon Aubroy, who was induced to address his conduct with more than usvalentness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do more than that–I mean my life, I heed the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you may save my honour, your friend's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do anything,\" replied Aubrey. \"I know but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my honour were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my death were unknot for some time in England–I—I—would do anything.\" –\"It shall not be disputed.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising his arms in exultant violence, \"Swear by all your senses, by your nature fears, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever might happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I sweor!\" said Aubrey; he sunk laughing upon his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altending his acquaintence with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew not why; when he remembered his oath a cold shiver came over him, as if from the presentiment of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the house in which he had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by himself and comrades, upon his retirment, to the pinionacle of a neighbour, according to a promise they had given his lordship, that it should be exposed to the first cold ray of the morning that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking some of the men, compelled to go and bury it upon the spot where it lay. But, when he mounted to the summit he found no trace of either the corpse or the cloths, though the robbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjectures, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a career in which he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to induce the superstitious melancholy which had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to convey him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Among other things there was a case containing several articles of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and arrows. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious features, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamental in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he found the weapon, and horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shaped, the dagger he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty; they seemed going to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the various tints upon the haft and sheath were alike in splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were concerning the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lard Ruthven's seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of since the deputation of his lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of life. He became morose and silent; and his only conversation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to savour the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his father, and there, for a moment,appeared to lose, in the embraces and embraces of his sister, all memory of the past. If she before, by her infantine caresses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more important as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaze and applause of large drawing-room assemblies. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the heat and atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy charm about it which did not appear to arise from misfortunc, but from some feeling with which, that appeared to make a soul conscious of a brighter realm. Her step was on that light footing, which stray where a butterfly or a colour might attract; she was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was constantly brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother conveyed to her his affection, and would in her presence forget the griefs she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the union? It seemed as if those eyes were playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not yet been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guardians more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protector. It was now, before, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would have remanded in the mansion of his fathers, and fed upon the melancholy which powered him. He could not feel interest about the habits of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and proposed for the next day, a room which had been advertised as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessivo–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and those who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, hastened thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. Whilst he was standing in a corner by himself, heedless of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first lime he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly begun to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his attention to this spot upon his first entry into society.\n-ety. He gazed till his limbs almast refusing to bear their weight.\nAt this, he was obliged to take the arm of a soldier, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with hurried steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Byron again before him–circumstances started up in dreadful array–the dagger–his oath–He roused himself, he would not make it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resting upon. It was impossible that it could be real–he determined, therefore, to go again into society; for when he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the question hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the house of a near relation. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired into a rocess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring throngs. Perceiving, at last, that many were leaving, he pretended himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by mourners, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those fecltures he had abharred. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with hurried step, carried her towards the fire.\nAt the door he found himself impeded by the crowd of servants who were wailing for their lords; and while he was engaged in addressing them, he suddenly heard someone whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"He did not dare to turn, but, burying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's living again presfed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attentions were now unheeded, and it was in consequence she intreated him to expain to her what had caused his abrupt departure. He only uttered a few words, and those terrified her. The more he thought, the more he was bewildered. His outburst startled him; was he really to allow this monster to roam, bearing rule upon his breath, amidst all he had dear, and not avert its progress? His very sister might have been touched by him. But if he were to break his oath, and disclose his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of empoying his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but death, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shut up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her fake, false nature. At once, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from street to street, anxious to fly that image which haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon-dawn sun as to the inidnight darns. He was no longer to be recognised; at first he returned with the prisoner to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest where fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon driven away by him, who fled from a pursuer closer than any—from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his own agreement the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into society, and watch him closoly, arixious to forewarn, in spite of his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and suspicious looks were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last obliged to beg of him to abstain from seeing, for her sake, a society which affixed him so strongly. Whilst, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it high time to remind me again that trust had been before secured upon them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesirous of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wanderings, and of preventing him from exposing to the general eye any marks of what they considered folly, they induced a physician to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice it, so completely was his mind absorbed by one particular subject. His incoherence became at last so great, that he was confined to his chamber. For he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection remaining displayed itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometime start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afficted her, he would desire her not to touch him. \"Oh, do not touch him–is your love for me is aught? do not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True! Yes!\" After a gain he sank into a slate, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incoherencations became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, which his guardians observed, that several time in the day he would count upon his finger a definite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so awful a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he looked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning intellect, of which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking this was a young Earl whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, and astonished him still more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desirability to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently now capable of being affected by the influence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to his bosom, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her husband's being once more adored to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warmth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every cliche of accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a hand upon her breast, opening it, which was in surprise at holding the features of the monster who had so long influenced her life. He seized the portrail in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the reputation of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of ennui, he bade her swear that she would never wed this man, for he– But he could not advance–it seemed as if that voice again bade him remember his oath–he turned only round, thinking Lard Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought it was but a relight of his disorder, entered, and separating him from Miss Aubrey, compelled her to leave him. He fell upon his knees before them, and impored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one else. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained the informatian. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretences of great affection for the brother and interest in him, he gradually won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who would resist his power? His life had dangers and toils to recount; could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could tell how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were only that he might listen to her soolhing cries; and whether, he knew so well how to use the serpent's tongue, or whether it was the will of fate, that he gained her affections. With the little of the elder branch falling at once to him, he obtained an important emigration, which served as an excuse for having the marriage, (in spite of her brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physician and his guard, attempted to rob the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their bride and the hope of their house, to delay by a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curfes. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to disturb any more the mind of Miss Aubry by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed on without rest to the male inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror or that may more easily be conceived described, the notes of busy preparation. Morning came, and the sound of carriages broke upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at last overtook their vigilance, they gradually slipped away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless woman. He seized the opportunity, with one bound was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking him by the arm by clasp, pulled him from the roam, speechless with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my word to day, your father is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he pushed him towards his attendants, who, roused by the old man, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the prisoner was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubrey's weakness improved; the effusion of blood produced symptoms of the near occurrence of death. He determined his sister's guard might be called, and when the midnight hour had struck, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians endeavoured to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they came, it was too late. Lord Russell had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRNE'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide.\"\nIN sailing through the Grecian Aegean archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we came into the harbour of M'Ilene in the island of that name. The reputation of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many British vessels to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and since it lies upon the route of the trade for ships baund to Smyrna, its bounties largely repay the cost of a voyage. We landed, as usual, on the bottom of the bay, and while first the men were employed in watering, and the purser bargaining for cattles with the villagers, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave surrounded Homer's School, and other places, where we had been beforc. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain named) We met with and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us he had come from Scotland with an English lad, who left the country four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylerie, where I am likely to be married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, five hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English currency,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who conducted us over the mansion. It consisted of five apartments on the ground floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bed-rooom, with a spacious closet enclosed. They were all simply decorated: plain grey-fibered walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain nearby, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a marble statue of Venus in a loaning posture; a largo couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedchamber had merely a largo mattress spread on the floor, with two small cotton quilts and a pillow—the common fare throughout Greece. In the sitting-room we observed a large chest, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large seaman's chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining it. On the table of the recess lay Vaire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Roussoau's works complete; Volncy's Ruins of Paris; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Miltan's Paradise Letter, an Italian edition, printed at Parma in 1810; several small pampblets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribbled all over, and morked with slips of paper, on which also were marks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading some books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move one thing with his orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherwise very good.\" I once did him a service; and I keep the produce of this farm for the purpose of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what reason.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The porlico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the sloped marble pilasters with black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a French Turkey oarpet, and an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their evenings in smoking, drinking good wines, such as \"lachryma christi,\" eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand as we entered the house, a small breeze glided about, grapes, oranges and limes were clustering together on its borders, and under the shade of two large myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we saw the lord passed many of his evenings and nights past twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and walking to market. \"I pray,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church twice a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from the seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle lilies in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream issuing from the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an arching horizon untouched by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, contrasting the clear blue wave with spots of emerald green. I had enjoyed a view of this; but our enquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will not,\"—\"And can you tell, old fellow?\" said I—\"If I can,\" replied he, \"I will not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we learnt some formal particulars of the insulted lord. He had portioned eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and even distributed them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one girl, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who earned by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. Drie circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thought proper not to repeat. He had a most beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the sea-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her to the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaeful isle of Mitylene; our minds all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money it was evident: he had philarithropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities which mark peculiar men. Arrived at Palermo, all our debts were discharged. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the archbishop, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Munich.\" We had never then heard of his lord's fame, and we had been some years from home; but \"Childe Harold\" being put into our hands we recognized the recluse of Calcla in every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more diligent in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Lone on some future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite untrue, and in jest to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an unfeeling disposition, averse to affection.\nNothing whatsoever with human nature, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as may be readily gathered from some little anecdotes. All the finer fancies of his heart, so elegantly depicted in his lordship's poems, ought to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a boing on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence hath thrown her mantle. No one can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume a right to give an opinion. Reputations are ever to be received with cautiori, paralularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dare to defend himself before that awful tribunal where he must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-mortician. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his name: to do good in secret, and receive the world's admiration, if the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-controlled conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "47": "THE VAMPYRE.\nA TRAGEDY.\nBy John William Pollard\nTHE superstition upon which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appears to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a Latin body could not remain if buried in their territory, it gradually became popular, and became the subject of many wonderful stories, still extenuating, of the dead rising from their graues, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres nightly imbibed a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and subsequently died of consumplions; while these human blood-suckers fattened—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, as to cause blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the very pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March, 32, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the commander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positivly and unanimously affirmed, that about five years before, a certain Henry, named Arnold Poul, had been heard to say, that, near Cassavia, on the frontiers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the evil, by eating some of the earth out of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of having been tortured by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be the case in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and oars, pure and florid blood. Prison having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A slak was driven entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have cried out as dreadfully as if he had been alive. When they were done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously died from vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and vanishes in his turn.\nChief bailiff.\nF.\nThis monstrance-road is here referred, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the present obscrvations than any other instance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment aftor death, for some heinous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not allowed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred and affection.—A proposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent, your corse shall from it be rent; Then gaily baunt the native place, and suck the blood of thy race; There from thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; Yet loath the bariquet which perforce must feed the living corse, Thy victims, ere they yet expire, shall know the demon for their sire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flawers are withered on the stem. But one that has committed this crime must be forgiven. The youngest, he who is beloved of all, shall bless them with a sister's name. That word shall wright thy heart in flame! Yet thou must end thy task and mark her cheek's last twinge, her eye's last spark, and the last gloopy glonce must view which frozes of its lifeless blue; thy allowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in lock and lock, her former Affection's fondness was strong; But now is bound away by thee Memorial of their agony! Yet with your best hood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and haggard lip; Then stalking to thy sullen grave, go; and with Gouls and Angles rave, Till these horror spirits shrink away from spectacles more accursed than they are.\nMr. Southey has also introduced in his collection a wild but beautiful poem of \"Thrice,\" the vampyre character of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represenled as having relurned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him she best loved whilst in existence. But this could not be supposed to have resulted from the sinful nature of her life, she being devout throughout the whole. The tale as a perfect typo of purity and innocence. The verocious Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of some of the most astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretended to have been an eyewitness; and Courtenay, in his great work upon this subject, besides a variely of anecdoles, and traditionory narratives illvstrative of its facts, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as a barbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horribbulous superstition might be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a treat, they must be necessary devoled to explanation, and which may now be concluded by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptance, there are several other terms synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vraucoloeha, Vardoulacha, Gouin, Broucoloka, &c.\nTHE VAMPYRE.\nIT happened that in the midst of the deliberations attendant upon a London writer, there appeared at the meetings of the leaders of the ton a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He gazed upon the mirth around him, as if he could not participate therein. Approximately, the light laughter of the woman only attracted his attention, that he might by a look quell it, and throw fear into those breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not explain whence it arose: some attributed it to the discoloured grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the body; but fell upon the cheek with a leaden weight which weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent outrage, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer tirit, whether from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, though its form and outline were beautiful, many of the female hunters after him have attempted to win his attentions, and have, at least, left marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been a mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a mountebank, to attract his attention: but in fact, when she stood before him, though his eyes were apparently fixed upon her's, still it seemed as if they were unperceived; even her unappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But though the common adultress could not influence ever the judgment of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was wholly indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he ever oddrossed himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as often among the females who form the boast of their sex and their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan lad with an elder sister in the possession of real wealth, by parents who died while he was yet in childhood. He was also protected by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they entrusted the more important part of his affairs to the care of military subalterns, he cultivated more imagination than his judgment. He had, however, that high romantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many manufacturers' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with virtue, and thought that vice was thrown in by Providence merely for the picturesque effect of the scenes we see in romances: he thought that the intimacy of a cottage merely consisted in the vesting of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by the irregular folds and variuse coloured patches. He thought, in fine, that the dreams of poets were the riches of life. He was handsome, frank, and rich: for these reasons, upon his enthronement into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striving which should describe with least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, so led him into false certitudes of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary pursuits, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presence of a fire, but from the effects of snuffing, there was no foundation in his life for any of the composes of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his tastes. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified career, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have now described, crossed him in his career.\nHe watched him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to capture every thing that flattered his prapensity of ideas, he soon formed this object into the hero of a romance, and determined to obscure the offspring of his fancy, rather than the person before him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attentions, and so far advanced upon his notice, that his preferment was always recognised. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's friends were embarrassed, and soon learned, from the manner of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desire of gaining some information respecting this singular character, which, until now, had only whetted his curiosity. He hinted to his guardians, that it was time for him to stop the tour, which for many years has been thought necessary to enable the young to take some rapid steps in the care of vice towards putting themselves up to an equality with the aged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjects of plea or of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. He consented, and Aubrey immediately communicating his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattered by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had been in company with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circling watch.\nHilbert Aubrey had no opportune of studying Lord Rulhven's character, and now he found, that, as many more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different corollaries from the apparent motive of his conduct. His company was profuse in his generosity; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not up to the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the misfortunes attendant even upon him, that he gave his alms; these were sent from the door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, and sink him still deeper in his iniquity, he was rewarded away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally revails over the retributive goodness of the virtuous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was more impressed upon his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a wound upon them, for they were all either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject rags. At Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apperent eagerness with which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vice; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youth of a novice, or the luckless father of a numcrous family; the latter his only wish seemed foreign's law—this apperent obstractedness of mind was laid aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat lying with the broken mouse. In every town, he left the former affluent youth, torn from the company he adorned, curfing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a fatber sat frantic, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immense wealth, wherewith to be even sufficent to satisfy their present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of any, the last gilder he had just snatched from the convulsive grasp of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of combing the acquaintance of the more experienced. Aubrey often wished to represent this to his friend, and beg him to resign from that charity and pleasurable which proved the ruin of his life, and did not tend to his own profit; but he always delayed it, for each day he hoped his friend would make some opportunily of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occured. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the most wild and rich sceries of nature, was always the same: his eye fpoke less than his lip; and though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wishing to break that story, which in his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rennes, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning circle of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memories of another almost destroyed city. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with eager impatience.\nThe first was from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if it had before entered into his conviction that there was an evil power resented in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient support for the belief. His guard insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and recommended, that his character was dreadfully vicissitudes, for that the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, rendered his licentious habits absolutely dangerous to society. It had been discovered, that his contempt for the adullress had rioted in hatred of her companion; but that he had required, to cancellance his gratification, that her lover, the partner of his gullt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of unsullicd virtue, down to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, that all the females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey discharged upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright spot on which to rest the eye. He resolved upon some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circumstances pass by unnoticed. He entered into the same circle, and witness stated, that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady of the house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is customary that an unmarried female is met with in saciety; he was therefore compelled to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignation had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and immediately asked him his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of him being about to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven answered that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have occasion on such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and immeditated suicide.\nUpon writing a letter, to say, that from that fact he must decline accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the mother of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely ordered his serjeant to give his complete assent to a separation; but did not hold any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Poninsola, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and there occupied himself in tracing the faded records of immense glory upon monumerits which apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen and before slaves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering soil or many lichen. Under the same roof as him, existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have formed the model for a painter wishing to pour tray on canass the promised hope of the falthful in Mahomel's parodise, save that her eyes spake too much mind for any one to think they could belong to those who had no souls. When she danced upon the plain, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy sullen look of the creature suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied him.\nAubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, show the whole beauty of her farm, floating as it wore upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just decamped up an almost effaced tablet, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. Often would her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly developing hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who let escape from his mind an object he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Papyrus. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and excitement, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and glittering balls. When first he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memory for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the history of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint to him in all the glowing colours of youthfulness, the marriage pamp she remembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to matters that had evidently made a greater impression upon her mind, would tell him the supernatural tale of her nurse. Her earnestness and apparent belief of what she narrated, excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living vampyre, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest ties, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely female to prolong his existence, and the ensuing month's, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such ludicrous and horrible fanatics; but she gave him the names of old men who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, for it had been remarked, that those who had dared to question their evidence, always had some proof given, which obliged them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulven; he, however, persisted in persuading her that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered at the many coincidences which had all tended to excile a belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her innocence, so contrasted with all the affluence of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he found him becoming increasingly and more attached to the lady before him. He would tear himself at times from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would depart, promising not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins around him, whilst in his mind he retained an image that regarded alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. She was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank infantile creature he had first known. She seemed to part from him with reluctance; but it was of little use for she had no one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror at the very thought. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when he heard the name of the place, they all at once begged of him not to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would over remain, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood sreeze, he was silent.\nNext morning he set off upon his excursion unencumbered; he was surprised to encounter the melancholic face of the hos, and was concurred to find that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, as night allowed the power of these beasts to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon end, and that in the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the warmer climates, rapidly gather in a tremendous mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoured country. He at last, though, mounted his horse, determined to make up by spoiled for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climes, is a most unknown; immediately the sun sets, the storm begins: and although he had advanced far, the power of the storm was tremendous–the echoing thunder had scarcely an interval of rest–and thick beavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue forked lashing seemed to fountain and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly his horse took fright, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the town, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the furious shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost inhuman sound; he was startled; but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He found himself in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unperceived; for, though he struggled, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; but then a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself grappled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to save his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from the ground and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his assailant threw himself up upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat—wherhe glare of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he immediately rose, and, following his prey, rushed through the door, and for a moment the crunching of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was so heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mud walls, and the torch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakos of soot. At the sight of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her charms; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair cousin brought in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was but a vision arising from his disturbed mind; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his fingers. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her face that seemed almost as attaching as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her, who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and foiry visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died from her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shudder, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almost unconciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of something a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the house, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they identified the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the corse. They were unmarried; both died broken-hearted.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intemperate moments he would call upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe–by some unaccouritable combination he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times he would imprecate maladies upon his head, and curse him as her destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chanced at this time to arrive at Athens, and, without any provocation, upon hearing of the death of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and started at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, expressing almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer appeared the apathetic being who had so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence seemed to be rapid, he again gradually retired into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former, except that at times he was surprised to see his gaze fixated intently upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation paying upon his lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid's recovery, Lord Routhven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or in morking the progress of those orbs, circling, like our world, the moveless sun;—indeed, he appeared to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and that elasticity of spirit which had so distinguished him now seemed to have fended for ever. He was now as much a lover of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find it in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought it amid the ruins he had formerly frequented, Anthea's form stood by his side—if he searched in the woods, her light step would appear lurking amidst the underwood, in the presence of the modest violet; then suddenly turning round, would show, to his wild imagination, her pale face and wounded throat, with a meek smile upon her lips. He determined to destroy every scene, every aspect of which created such bitter assizes in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tremendous care he had taken of him during his illness, that they should visit those parts of Greece neither had yet seen. They travelled in every direction, and sought every spot to which a recollection could be attached: but though they thus passed from place to place, they seemed not to heed what they gazed upon. They heard much of robbers, but they gradually began to slight these reports, which they imagined were only the invention of indviduals, whose interest it was to excite the generosity of those whom they protected from pretended dangers. In consequence of their neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion they travelled with only a few guineas to serve as guide and as a defence. Upon entering, through, a narrow passage, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of ruck brought down from the neighbouring provinces, they had resolved to repent their negligence; for scarcely were the whole of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were startled by the sudden firing of bullets close to their heads, and the echoed report of several guns. In an instant their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction whence the repart came. Lord Ruthven and Lord Aubrey, following their example, retired for a moment behind the shoring line of the regiment, but ashamed of being thus detained by a foe, who with jovial spirits made them advance, and being exposed to ambush.\nAs a matter of fact, if any of the robbers should climb above and take them in the rear, they ceased at once to march forward in fear of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the hold of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his assistance; and, no longer heedning the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the robbers' faces around him–his guards having, upon Lord Ruthven's being wounded, immediately thrown up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promise of great reward, Avrey soon induced them to convey his wounded brother to a neighbouring cabin; and having agreed upon a ransom, he was no more disturbed by their present presence–they being content merely to guard the entrance till their colleague should return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthven's strength rapidly declined; and two days mortification ensued, and death seemed advancing with hasty sleps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconcious of pain as he had been of the objects about him: but towards the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently vengeful, and his eyes often fixed upon Aubrey, who was induced to offer his assistance with more than usual earnestness—\"Assist me!\" You may save me–you may do better than that–I mean not my life, I heed the death of my once as little as the passing day; but you may save my honour, your father's honour. \"How? Tell me how? \"I would do any thing,\" replied Aubrey. \"I need but little–my life ebbs apace–I cannot explain the whole–but if you would conceal all you know of me, my life were free from stain in the world's mouth–and if my whereabouts were unknown for some time in England–I—I–but life. \"It shall not be known.\" \"Swear!\" cried the dying man, raising himself in exultant violence, \"Swear that all your soul reveres, by all your nature fear; swear that, for a year and a day you will not impart your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever may happen, or whatever you may see. His eyes seemed bursting from their sockets: \"I swear!\" He sunk laughing upon his pillows, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances atlending his acquaintance with this man rose upon his mind, and he knew why; when he remitted his oath a cold feeling came over him, as if from the presontinent of something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the room in which he had found the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been conveyed by him and his comrades, upon his retiring, to the pinnacle of a neighbouring mount, according to a promise he had given his lordship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury the body upon the spot where it lay. But, when he had reached to the summit he found no trace of the corpse or the clothes, though the rabbers swore they pointed out the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time his mind was bewildered in conjunctions, but he at last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had had to contend with such terrible misfortunes, and which all apparently conspired to hoighten that superstitious melancholy which had seized upon his mind, he resolved to leave it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied himself in arranging the effects he had wit him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst other things there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victor.\nThere were several daggers and arrows. Whilst turning them over, and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut–he shuddered–hastening to gain further proof, he touched the weapon, and his horror may be imagined when he discovered that it fitted, though peculiarly shapcd, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need no further certainty–they seemed gazing to be bound to the dagger; yet still he wished to disbelieve; but the particular form, the same varying tints upon the blade and sheath were identical on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home, at Rome, his first inquiries were upon the lady he had attempted to snatch from Lord Ruthven's seduction arts. Her parents were in distress, their livelihood ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's mind became almost overwhelmed under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer Hanthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted in urging the speed of the proceedings, as if he were going to save the life of some one he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wafted him to the English shores; and he hastened to the mansion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sifter, all memory of the past. If she had formerly, by her infantine careſses, had gained his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attaching herself to him than before.\nMr. Aubrey had not that winning grace which gains the gaiety and applause of the drawing-room attendants. There was none of that light brilliancy which only exists in the beated atmosphere of a crowded place. Her blue eye was never lit up by the levity of the mood beneath. There was a melancholy character about it which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some feeling within, that appeared to occupy a soul confcious of a brighter realm. Her step was not that light footing, which sometimes strays where a butterfly or a colour may approach; it was sedate and perisive. When alone, her face was never brightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed to her his affection, she would in her mind forget those horrors. She knew destroyed his reputation, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed as if those eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was yet only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it having been thought by her guard more fit that her presentation should be delayed until her brother's return from the continent, when he might be her protegee. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawing-room, which was fast approaching, should be the occasion of her entry into the \"busy scene.\" Aubrey would rather have remained in the manion of his fathers, and fed upon the malignancy which overpowered him. He could not feel interest about the frivolities of fashionably strangers, when his mind had been so torn by the events he had witnessed; but he resolved to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been adapted as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was extraordinary–a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and those who were anxious to bask in the smile of royalty, crowded thither. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, hoedles of all around him, engaged in the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that very place—he felt himself suddenly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear—\"Remember your oath.\" He had hardly time to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would frighten him, when he pereceived, from a little distance, the same figure which had attracted his notice on this spot on his first entry into society. He gazed till his limbs almost refusing to bear their weight, he was obliged to take the hand of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into the carriage, and was driven home. He paced the room with rried steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts were bursting from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him–circumstances started up in a dreadful array–the defendant–his oath–He roused himself, he could not believe it possible–the dead rise again!–He thought his imagination had conjured up the image his mind was resling upon. It was impossible that he could be real–he determined, therefore, to get again into society; for though he attempted to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in gaining admission. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assembly of a regiment. Leaving her under the prolection of a matron, he retired into a recess, and there gave himself up to his own devouring habits. Perceiving, at once, that some men were leaving, he removed himself, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in earnest conversation; he attempted to pass through and get near her, when one, whom he requested to move, turned round, and revealed to him those features he most dreaded. He sprang forward, seized his sister's arm, and, with a hurried step, forded towards the passage: at the door he found himself impedod by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing them, he heard a voice whisper close to him—\"Remember your oath!\"–He did not dare to turn, but, hurrying his sister, soon reached home.\nAubrey became extremely distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by one subject, how much more completely was it engaged, now that the certainty of the monster's living again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's concerns were now heard, and it was in vain that she induced him to explain to her what had caused this abrupt occurrence. He only uttered a few words, and those infuriated her. The more he thought, tho more he was bewildered. His oath started him; was he then to allow this monster to roam, bearing ruiri upon his breath, amidst all he held dear, and not arrest its progress? His very sister must have been terrified of him. But even if he were to break his oath, and close his chambers, who would believe him? He thought of employing his own hand to free the world from such a wretch; but deal, he remembered, had been already mocked. For days he remained in this state; shul up in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes streaming with tears, besought him, for her sake, to support her. At last, no longer capable of bearing stillness and solitude, he left his house, roamed from place to place, anxious to fly that image which had possessed him. His dress became loose, and he wandered, as of course exposed to the noonday sun as to the midnigh damps. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with him to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtook him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon distanced by him who fled from a pursuer swifter than any—from thought. His character, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence the whole of his friends, with a fiend amongst them, of whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to entice him again into society, and watch him closely, anxious to forewarn him, in spite of his oath, a man whom Lord Russell opproached with intimacy. But when he entered into a room, his haggard and fuspicious eyes were so striking, his inward shudderings so visible, that his sister was at last compelled to beg of him to abstain from seeking, for her sake, the society which affected him so strongly. When, however, remonstrance proved unavailing, the guardians thought proper to interpose, and, fearing that his rurid was becoming alionated, they thought it high time to resume the restrictions which had been before imposed on them by Aubrey's parents.\nDesired of saving him from the injuries and sufferings he had daily encountered in his wandering, and of preventing him from expositing to the general public those marks of what they considered folly, they engaged a physiologist to reside in the house, and take constant care of him. He hardly appeared to notice him, so completely was his mind absorbed in one terrible crime. His incoherence became at last too great, and he was confined to his chair. There he would often lie for days, incapable of being roused. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attained a glassy lustre; the only sign of affection and recollection having displaced itself upon the entry of his sister; then he would sometimes start, and, seizing her hands, with looks that severely afflicted her, he would desire her not to follow him. \"Oh, do not touch him! If your love for me is aught, DO not go near him!\" When, however, she inquired to whom he referred, his only answer was, \"True!\" Again he went into a state, whence not even she could rouse him. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year was passing, his incohercences became less frequent, and his mind threw off a portion of its gloom, whilst his friends observed, that several times in the day he would count upon his fingers a finite number, and then smile.\nThe time had nearly elapsed, when, upon the last day of the year, on the occasion of his guardian entering his room, began to communicate with his physician on the melancholy circumstance of Aubrey's being in so melancholy a situation, when his sister was going next day to be married. Instantly Aubrey's attention was attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Glad of this mark of returning in good conduct, from which they feared he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. He was a young Earl whom he had acquainted with in society, and he seemed pleased, and excited them even more by his expressing his intent to be present at the nuptials, and desiring to see his sister. They answered not, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the insluence of her lovely smile; for he pressed her to him, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of her brother's being once more alive to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warth, and to congratulate her upon her marriage with a person so distired for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket upon her chest; opening it, what was his surprise at beholding the features of the monster who had so long occupied his life. He seized the purse in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. Upon her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her–then seizing her hands, and gazing on her with a frantic expression of countenancy, he bade her swear that she would never wed this morister, for he– But he would not advance–it seemed as if that prosecutor again bade him remember his oath–he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthveri was near him but saw no one. In the meantime the guardians and physician, who had heard the whole, and thought this was but a return of his disorder, intervened, and forcing him from Miss Aubrey, desired her to leave him. He fell upon his knees to them, he implored, he begged of them to delay but for one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined had taken possession of his mind, endeavoured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing-room, and had been refused with every one present. When he heard of Aubrey's ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he earned that he was deemed insane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had gained this insult. He bore to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretence of great affection for the brother in the most unfortunate fate, he successfully won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and toils to recount: could speak of himself as of an individual having no sympathy with others being on the crowded earth, save with her to whom he addressed himself; could toll how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it were merely that he might listen to her soothing accents; or fine, he knew so well how to use the serpents's art, or such was the will of fate, that he gained her affection. The title of the elder branch falling at length to him, he received an important embassy, which served as an excuse for having the marriage, (in spite of his brother's deranged state,) which was to take place the very day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left with the physician and his guardians, attempted to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, saying she valued her own happiness, her own honour, and the honour of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the most heavy curses. The witnesses promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the physician, he thought it better not to harass any more the mind of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the ravings of a maniac. Night passed with no rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Arnold heard, with a horror which may more easily be conceived than described, the noise of breaking preparation. Marning came, and the sound of chains brake upon his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at once overcame their vigilance, they produced a knife, and stole away, leaving him in the custody of an helpless woman. He seized the opportunity, with one blow was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all were nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurricd him from the room, seething with rage. When on the staircase, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear—\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my bride to day, your sister is dishonoured. Women are frail!\" So saying, he directed him towards his attending officers, who, accompanied by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding vent, had broken a carriage-vessel, and he was conveyed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid of agitating her. The engagement was solemnised, and the bride and bridegroom left Lorond.\nAubrey's weakness induced; the constriction of blood produced symptams of the near approach of death. He desired his sister's guardians might be called, and when the midnight hour had passed, he related composedly what the reader has perused–he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had glutted the thirst of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF LORD BYRON'S RESIDENCE, &c.\n\"The world was all before him, where he could choose his place of rest, and regulate his direction.\"\nIN Sailing across the Gregoian Archipelago, on board one of His Majesty's vessels, in the year 1812, we came into the harbour of Mitylene, the island of the same name. The fame of this place, and the constant supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, induce many Brits to visit it—both men of war and merchantmen; and though it lies rather out of the track for ships hound to Smyrna, bounties amply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watching, and the purser barging for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and myself took a ramble to the cave called Hamer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the brow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met with and engaged a young Greek lad, our guide, who told us he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days previous to our arrival in his country. \"He engaged me as a pilot,\" said the Greek, \"and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to quit Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was an odd, but a very good man. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, belong to him, and he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-trader, six hundred zeroes for it, (about £250 English value,) and has resided here about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his canoe very often to the different islands.\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we wasted no time in hastening to the house where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an officer, who directed us over the mansion. It consisted of four apart rooms on the ground-floor—an entrance hall, a drawing-room, a sitting parlour, and a bedroom, with a spacy closet annexed. They were all plainly decorated:plain green-stained walis, marble tables on either side, a large window in the centre, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the bronches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a leaning posture; a large cushion or sofcloth complemented the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-case: there were no mirrors, except a single painting. The bed chamber had merely a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton quilts and a pillow—the common bedstead in Greece. In the sitting-room we obserued a marble shelf, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papiers, which were then in a large seaman's box. In the closet. It was open, but we did not think ourselves justified in examining the contents. On the tablet of the recorders lay Voltoire's, Shakspeare's, Boileau's, and Rousseau's works complete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Grecian languange; Klopstock's Messiah; Katzebue's novels; Schiller's play of the Robber; Milton's Parodise Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Peking in 1891; several small pamphlets from the Greek press at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The mantle was literally scrawled all over, and marked with slips of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said: \"The lord had been reading these books the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but,\" said he, \"there they must lie until his return; for he is so particular, that were I to move on without orders, he would frown upon me for a week together; he is otherways very good.\" I once did have a serjeant; and I haue the produce from this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty shillings which I pay to an aged Armerian who residces in a small coltage in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I don't know for what purpose.\"\nThe appearance of the house externally was pleasing. The portico in front was fifty paces long and fourteen broad, and the fluted marble pillars wit black plinths and fret-work cornices, (as it is now customary in Grecian architecture,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone coping, was covered by a fine Turkoy carpet, beneath an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as upon them the Greeks pass their hours smoking, drinking light spirits, such as \"lachryma christi,\" catching fire, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the fourth and as we entered the house, a small streaking bird glided away, grapes, oranges and limes were cluttering together on its borders, and under the shade of two largo myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an omamental wooden back was placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights till twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old man, \"praying\" for he was very devout, \"and always attended our church five days a week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe view from this seat was what may be termed \"a bird's-eye view.\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the summit of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream running through the ruins descended in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain's base. The sea smooth as glass, and an horizon unshadowed by a single cloud, terminates the view in front; and a little to the left, through a vista of lofty chesnut and palm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a cigar more than I did this; but our inquiries were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: none knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to China. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor, \"could tell, but I am sure he will riot,\"—\"And cannot you tell, old fart?\" I said, \"If I can,\" said he, \"I dare not.\" We had not time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the town we found several personal letters of the learned lord. He had portioned some young girls when he was last upon the island, and had danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to one man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisher man who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the parish clergy. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collected, to have been a very eocentric and benevolent character. One circumstance we learnt, which our old friend at the cottage thougbt proper not to disclose. He had a well-behaved daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the secl-shore, and he had bought her a piano-forte, and taught her himself the use of it.\nSuch was the information with which we departed from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this rambler in Gee could be. He had money it was evident: he had philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities which mark peculiar men. Arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling out of company will be Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATT'S, who had been on travelling in Egypt and Greece, \"The individual,\" said he, \"about whom you are anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I acquainted him at Messina.\" We had never then heard of his lordship's fame, as we had been some years away; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put into our hands we recognised the recluse of Calcla in every way. Deeply did we regret not having been more careful in our researches at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to M'Ilene on some future day; but to know that day will never return. I make this statement, believing it not quite uninteresting, and in jest to his lordship's good name, which has been grossly slandered. He has been discharged.\nHe regarded himself as of an unfeeling disposition, averse to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or odd to its pleasures. The fact is direct the reverse, as may be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly deplored in his lordship's poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tendernities, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions: and his courting the repose of solitude is an additional reason for marking him as a man on whose heart Religion hath set her seal, and over whose head Benevolence has thrown her mantle. No man can read the preceding pleasing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a counsellor. With respect to his loues or pleasures, I do not assume a right to judge his opinion. Reports are ever to be received with caution, particularly when directed against man's moral integrity; and he who dares justify himself before that awful tribunal where all must appear, alone may censure the errors of a fellow-man. Lord Byron's character is testimony of his genius. To do good in secret, and shun the world's applause, is the surest testiment of a virtuoso mind and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END.\nGillet, Prinler, Crown-court, Fleet-slreet."

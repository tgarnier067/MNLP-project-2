    "3": "THE superstition upon which this was founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it appeared to be common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assumed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at which time, the idea becoming prevalent, that a human body could not recover if buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, till extant, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West its occurred, with some slight variation, all over Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, whoro the houses existed, that peculiarly imitated a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and speedily died of strangulation; whilst these human blood-suckers fattened, and their veins became distended to such a state of completion, as to cause the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodies, and even from the deep pores of thoir skins.",
    "4": "In the London Journal, of March, 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is stated to have occurred at Madreyga, in Hungary. It appears, that upon an examination of the cornmander-in-chief and magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed, that, about five years before, a certair de Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been compelled to say that, at Cassovia, on the fringes of the Turkish service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to rid himself of the disease, by eating some of the earth out of the vampyr's grove, and rubbing himself with his blood. This punishment, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampyre again; and, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many persons complained of being tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four persons had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent further mischief, the inhabitants having consulted their physicians, took up the body, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in cafes of purism) fresh, and entirely free from corruptions, and emitting at the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and unfiltered blood. Proof having been thus obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the chest and body of Arnold Paul, at which he is reported to have screamed out dreadfully as is he had been shot. This done, they cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horses of those persons who had previously suffered from melancholy, lest they should, in their turn, become jealous of others who survived them.",
    "5": "The universal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.",

    "7": "This monstrous scene is here related, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the prisoner's servations than any other resistance which could be adduced. In many parts of Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after death, for some horrible crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not entirely doomed to vampyrise, but compelled to confine his infernal vices solely to the beings he loved most while upon earth—those to whom he was bound by ties of kindred affection and affection.—A supposition alluded to in the \"Gospel.\"",
    "8": "But here on earth, as Vampyre sent, thy corſe shall from its tomb be rent; Then ghastly haunt the new place, and suck the life out of all thy race; There shall be thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the stream of life; Yet at the banquet which perforee must feed thy livid living cſes, The victims, when they yet expirc, shall know the demon for the devil fire; As cursing thee, thou cursing them, Thy flower are withered on the stem. But one that for thy crime must not fall, The youngest, best beloved of all, Shall bless thee with a father's name— That word shall wrap thy heart in flaine! Yel, thou must end thy task and inark Her cheek's last tinge–her eye's last spark, and the last glassy glance must view which frees her lifeless body; Then with unballowed hand shall tear the tresses of her yellow hair, of which, in life a lock of her brother Affection's fondest pledge was worn– But now is borne away by thee Memorial of her agony! Yet with thine own hands blood shall drip; Thy gnashing tooth, and bagging lip; Then striking to thy sullen gravestone, Go—arid with Gouls and Afrits rave, till the world in horror shrinks away from place more accursed than they.",
    "9": "Mr. Southey was also intraduced in his wild and beautiful poem of \"Thalaba,\" the favourite coronation of the Arabian maid Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting her husband, whom she best loved whilst in exile. All this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinful habits of her life, she being presented through the whole of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The correspondent Tournant gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he pretends to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his considerable work upon this subject, besides avariety of anecdotes, and traditionary narratives illustrative of its effects, has put forth some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbarian evil.",
    "10": "Many curious and intresting notices on this singularly horrible superstition might be added; but the present may suffice for the purposes of a note, hardly devoted to explanation, and which may now be concurred with by merely remarking, that though the term Vampyre is the one in most general acceptation, there are several others synonymous with it, made use of in various parts of the world: as Vroucocha, Vardouacba, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.",

    "12": "IT happened that in the midst of the dissipations attendant upon a London winter, there appeared at the village partles one of the leaders of the ton anobleman, and marked for his singularities, the man who ran it. He gazed upon the mirth arrayed him, as if he could not part from therein. Apperently, the light laughter of the fair maiden attracted his attention, that he might by a loud shout quoll it, and throw fear into those breasts where thughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this sensation of awe, could not help laughing when it arose: some attrihuted the dead grey eye, which, fixing upon the object's face, did not seem to penetrate, and at one glance to pierce through to the inward workings of the heart; but fell upon the eye with a leaden ray which weighed upon the skin it could not pass. His peculiities caused him to be invited to every house; all wished to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of ennui, were pleased at having someone in their preserice capable of engaging their attentions. In spite of the deadly hue of his face, which sometimes gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its form and outline were beautiful, many of the male hunters after marriage attempted to win his attentions, and show, to him, some marks of what they might term affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster shewn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself in his way, and did all but put on the dress of a milliner, to attract his attention:–though in vain:–when she stood before him, though his eyes were apperently fixed upon her's, until it seemed as though they were unperceived;–evidently her unappalled expression was baffled, and she left the room. But though the prosecutrix could not ascertain ever the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innocent daughter, that few knew he addressed himself to men. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and whether it was that it even overcame the dread of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was as esteemed among those females who form the boast of the sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their vices.",
    "13": "About the same time, there came to London a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with an only sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died when he was yet in childhood. Left also to himself by guardians, who thought it their duty merely to take care of his fortune, while they relinquished the more important charge of his mind to the care of mercenary authorities, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, hence, that highromantic feeling of honour and candour, which daily ruins so many milliners' apprentices. He believed all to sympathise with misfortune, and thought that violence was thrown in by Providence merely for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage morely consisted in the wearing of clothes, which were as warm, but which were better adapted to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, however, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frarik, and ruffian: for these reasons, upon his entering into the gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, striking which was the least truth their languishing or romping favourites: the daughters.",
    "14": "But at the same time, by their brightening countenances when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, they led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the ramble of his solitary hours, he was startled at finding that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickered, not from the presencence of a ghost, but from want of snuffing, there was no foundalion in his life for any of that congeries of pleasing pictures and descriptions contained in those volumes, from which he had formed his study. Failing, however, some compensation in the gratified vanity, he was about to relish his dreams, when the extraordinary circumstance we have above described, crossed him in his career.",
    "15": "He watched him; and the virtual impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who showed few other signs of observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of all contact: allowing his imagination to picture every thing that slanted its propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the subject of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fancy, rather than the persons that besore him. He became acquainted with him, paid him attention, and so advanced upon his notice, that his presence was observed. He gradually learnt that Lord Ruthven's affoirs were embarassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in Baker's Street, that he was about to travel. Desiré of gaining some information respecting this mysterious character, who, till now, had only whetted his curiosity, he hinted to his guardians that it was time for him to perform the act, which for many generations has been considered necessary to enable young men to take some rapid steps in the career of men towards putting themselves upon an equality with the governed, and not allowing them to appear as if falling from the skies,whenever such intrigues are mentoned as the subjects of pleasantry or of pique, according to the degree of skill shewn in carrying them on. They consented, and Avrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. -",
    "16": "By such a mark of affection for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed through the circling waterf.",
    "17": "Hitherto, Aubrey had had no opportunity of studying Lord Ruthven's character, and now he found, that, though many more of his contemporaries were exposed to his conduct, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality; the idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wants. But Aubrey could not avoid remarking, that it was not upon the voracious, reduced to iridity by the missortunes attendant even upon virtuosity, that he besought his cocks; these were sent from his door with hardly suppressed sneers; but when the profligate man should ask something, not to relieve his wants, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink him even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retiring bashfulness of the virluous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was nothing more than pure in his mind: all those upon whom it was bestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, for they were all either led to the abyss, or sunk to the lowest and the most abominable depths. At Brussels and other places through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought for the entertainment of all fashionable vicars; there he entered into all the spirit of the faro table: he betted, and always gambled with success, except where the known sharper was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he gained; but it was always with the same unchanging face, with which he generally watched the society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the rash youthful novice, or the luckless offspring of a nurnerous family; then his very wish feemed fortune's law—this apparent abstracledness of mind was said aside, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than that of the cat whilst dallying with the dead mouse. In every town, he left the formerly affluenl youth, torn from the circle he adorncd, curling, in the solitude of a dungeon, the state that had drawn him within the reach of this fiend; whilst many a father sat bitterly, amidst the speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late immenœe wealth, wherewith to buy even sufficient to satisfy the present craving. Yet he took no money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gilder he had just snatched from the conulsive grasp of the innuent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was riot, however, capable of overturning the eunning of the more unscrupulous.",
    "18": "MURDERER. Aubrey often wished to represent himself to his friend, and beg him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of his life, and did not belong to his own profit; but he delayed it–for each day he hoped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and openly to him; however, this never occurred. Lord Ruthven in his carriage, and amidst the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and when Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification from it than the constant excitement of secretly wishing to break the rickety, which in his exalted imagination seemed to assume the appearance of something supernatural.",
    "19": "They soon arrived at Romc, and Aubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the morning call of an Italian countess, whilst he went in search of the memorials of another almost drowned child. Whilst he was thus engaged, letters arrived from England, which he oponed with eager impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing not only but affection; the others were from his friends, the latter astounded him; if it had ever entered into his imagination that there was an evil power resident in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belief. His guardians insisted upon his immediately leaving his friend, and urged, that his character was dreadfully vicious, for that the possession of irresolute powers of seduction rendered his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been contended, that his contempt for the female had not originated in hatred of her character; but that he had required, to increase his gratification, that her husband, the partner of his guilt, should be hurled from the pinnacle of vinous virtue, dowry to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fact, all those females whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown even the mask aside, and had not scrupled to expose the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.",
    "20": "Aubrey detained upon leaving one, whose companion had not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent some plausible pretext for abandoning him altogether, purposing, in the mean while, to watch him more closely, and to let no slight circulations pass by unnoticed. He entered into the room, and soon perceived that his Lordship was endeavouring to work upon the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he chiefly frequented. In Italy, it is custom that an unmarried female is met with in secrecy; he was therefore obliged to carry on his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his winding, and soon discovered that an affair had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thoughtless girl. Losing no time, he entored the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked him in his intents to pay respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven answered, that his feelings were such as he supposed they would have upon such an occasion; and upon being pressed whether he intended to marry her, merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must discharge accompany his lordship in the remainder of his proposed tour, he ordered his servant to seek other apartments, and calling upon the sister of the lady, informed her of all he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignation was prevented. Lord Ruthven next day merely wrote to notify his complete assent to a separation; but did not hint any suspicion of his plans having been foiled by Aubrey's interposition.",
    "21": "Having left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greece, and crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself at Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the faded records of an old glory upon monuments that apparently, ashamed of chronicling the deeds of freemen only before slaues, had hidden them beneath the sheltering soil or many cooured lichen. Under the same roof as he himself, experienced a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might have served the model for a pincer wishing to pour tray on caravans the promised hope of the pious in Mahomet's palace, but that her eyes spoke too much mind for any one to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced upon the plank, or tripped along the mountain's side, one would have thought the gazelle a poor type of creature; for who would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that sleepy luxuriant look of the animal suited but to the taste of an epicure. The light step of the girl often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often saw the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Bengal bulterfly, show the whole beauty of her form, floating as it were upon the wind, to the eager gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had first decamped up to an almighty effaced spot, in the contemplation of her sylph-like figure. If her tresses falling, as she flitted around, exhibit in the sun's ray such delicately brilliant and swiftly fading hues, it might well excuse the forgetfulness of the antiquary, who could not escape from his memory the very object he had before him of vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why attempt to describe charms which all feel, but none can appreciate?–It was innocence, youth, and beauty, unaffected by crowded drawing-rooms and stifling balls. Whilst he drew those remains of which he wished to preserve a memoranda for his future hours, she would stand by, and watch the magic effects of his pencil, in tracing the scenes of her native place; she would then describe to him the circling dance upon the open plain, would paint, to him in all the glowing colours of youth memory, the marriage pomp which she remembered viewing in her irascibility; and then, turning to subjects that had evident had a greater imprimatur upon her mind, would tell him all the supernatural talcs of her nurse. Her appearance and apparent belief of what she narrated excited the interest even of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the living monster, who had passed years amidst his friends, and dearest companions, forced every year, by feeding upon the life of a lovely girl, to prolong his existence for the ensuing months, his blood would run cold, whilst he attempted to laugh her out of such idiotic and horrible fantasies; but she cited to him the names of several old men, who who had at last detected one living among themselves, after several of their near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the fiend's appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged of him to believe her, and as it had been, remarked, that those who had dared to question their existence, always had some proof giving them, which compelled them, with grief and heartbreaking, to confess it was true. She detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, by hearing a pretty accurate description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted in persisting her, that he could see some truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondred at the many coincidences which had all tended to induce a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.",
    "22": "Aubrey began to attach himself more and more to her; her appearance, so contrasted with all the afflicted virtues of the women among whom he had so vaunted his vices of romance, won his heart; and when he rid himself of a young man of English habits, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, still he found himself more attached and more attentive to her almost fairy form before him. He would tear himself away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian reseal, he would depart, determined not to return until his object was attained; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention upon the things around him, when first in his mind he retained an identity that seemed to him the rightful possessor of his things. He was unconscious of his love, and was ever the same frank insensible being he had first known. She always seemed to withdraw from him with reluctance; but it was becaufe she had no longer any one with whom she could visit her favourite haunts, whilst her guardian was occupied in sketching or uncovering some secret which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeaused to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with some apprehension, affirmed their existence, but with horror at the very name. Shortly after, Aubrey determined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was to detain him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once be warned of him not to return at night, as he must pass through a wood, where no one would ever remain, and the day had closed, without any consideration. They described it as the return of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heavy evils as impending upon him who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to frighten them out of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his daring thus to mock a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.",
    "23": "Next morning Aubrey set off upon his excursion unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to learn that his words, mocking the folly of those horrid fiends, had inspired them with such terror. When he was about to depart, she came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, for night allowed the power of these beasts to be put in action; he promised. He was, however, so occupied in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light would soon come, and that on the horizon there was one of those specks which, in the wormer company, so rapid gather into a tremendous mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country.He at last, bow ever, mounted his horse, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediate after the sun sets, night begins: and before he had advanced far, the power of the starm waded above—the echoing thunders had scarcely an interval of rest—its thick heavy rain forced its way through the canopying foliage, whilst the blue fountained lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly his horse bolted, and he was carried with dreadful rapidity through the entangled forest. The animal at last, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, under the glare of lightning, that he was in the neighbourhood of a bovel that hardly lifted itself up from the masses of dead caves and brushwood which surrounded it. Dismouring, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the other side, or at least trusting to obtain shelter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a moment silen, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the stifled, exultant mockery of a laugh, contending in one almost unbroken sound; he was startled: but, roused by the thunder which again rolled over his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced open the door of the hut. He followed him in utter darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, though he called, still the sounds continued, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in company with someone, whom he immediately recognized; when a voice cried, \"Again baffled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt himself groppled by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his wife as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enemy threw himself upon him, and kneeling upon his breast, had placed his hands upon his throat; when the glare of several torches penetrating through the hole which gave light in the day, disturb him; he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in consequence the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The fire was now out; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those about. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the mounds, and the thatch loaded on every individual straw with heavy flakes of soot. At the desire of Aubrey they searched for her who had attracted him by her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the airy form of his fair conductress lying in a lifeless condition. He shut his eyes, hoping that it was just a visjon arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unclosed them, stretched by his side. There was no colour upon her cheek, not even upon her lip; yet there was a stillness about her body that seemed almost as absorbing as the life that once dwelt there:–upon her neck and breast was blood, and upon her throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein:–to this the men pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror, \"A Vampyre!\" \"A Vampyre!\" A lilter was quickly formed, and Anne was laid by the side of her who had lately been to him the object of so many bright and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had long resided within her. He knew not what his thoughts were–his mind was benumbed and seemed to shun reflection, and take refuge in vacancy–he held almast uriconsciously in his hand a naked dagger of a particular constriction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of a child whom a mother had missed. Their loud cries, as they approached the city, forewarned the parents of some dreadful catastrophe. –To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they ascertained the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chest. They were inconsolable; they died broken-hearted."

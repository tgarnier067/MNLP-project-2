    "0": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this state is based is very general in the East. However, it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not take the form of presents since the division that the Latin and Greek churches had; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a body of Latin could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually creed, and formed the object of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead who rose from their graves, and fed on the blood of young and beautiful tho. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, which were the helies, that part of the blood of their victims, which has become emaciated, lost their strength and quickly died of corruption; while these human blood suckers have become fattened — and their veins have become distended to such a state of ropletion, as to cause the blood of all passages of their badges to flow, and even from the ucry pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrifin, which is declared for Hove accused in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the arid magistrates of the chief impoundment, they affirmed in a positive and unanimous way, that about five years earlier, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had blotted out to say, that, in Cassova, ori the brothers of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of the euj 1, by eating part of the earth of the epi of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from flouting a vampire hesels; so, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complain about having 6th tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other troubles, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and did it freshly (as it supposed to be in the cafes of armarism) and fully free of corruption, and emit to rnuth, riosis, and ears, pure and fluid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was entirely pushed by Arnold Paul's bear and body, where it is reported to have a cold terribly as it was olive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the glasses into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these people who had previously dictated a variety, for fear that they would in turn become undisputed by others who survived them.\nThe universe 1 belief just that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, arid sucks in turn.\nThe Chlef Bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the presentations than any other resistance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered to be a kind of punishment after death, for some heinous crimes committed when it existed, that the deceased is not condemned to vampyria, but has supposed to limit the visitors bis infernal only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by bonds of friendship and effect. — An assumption mentioned in \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, the corse shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of the natius, and suck it blood of all your race; there shall thy daughter, sister, and woman, smite, about midnight, drain the stream of life; yet the banquet that precedes shall feed thy living corse; thy victims, or they still expire, Shail know the devil for the fire to be built; as thou cursed them, thy flowers are wilted upon the stem. But he who falls for your crime, the youngest, the best loved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart in the flaine! You must put an end to your task, and sit down at the last tint of his head, the last spark of his eyes, and the last glittery look seeth Who freozes over his life without life; then, with the unsaved hand will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock which Afficction bore the tenderest pledge was carried—but now is carried by the memorial of the lhine agony! And the blood shall flow, the thy grinning tooth, and thy gag; and thou shalt be in the ravine, and thou shalt be gratified with the gouls and Afrits, until the women of horror depart from them, more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey Chls was also introduced into his wild and beautiful blue poem of \"Thalaba\", the vompyre force of the Arab handmaid Oneiza, who is represented as Hairig, came back from the grave in order to torment hirn, which better loved during his existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resulting from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true concert gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrsm, to which he claims to have been witness ari; and Calmet, iri, his great work on this subject, besides the damage of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating the effects of just, has put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove that he is a classic, as well as barbaric errar.\nMany curious and intriguing opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; on the other hand, the present can be be begged for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which are now concluded by simply notice, that although the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacba, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, he appeared to the parte varieties and to the leaders of your anobleman, inorable for his singularities, with his runk. He looked at the mirror of the abroad, as if he could not participate in it. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous has drawn his attention, so that he can blow by one hurdle, and cast fear into those breasts where it reigned carelessness. Those who felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain when he rose: a certain attitude to the dead grey eye, which, staring upward at the face of the object, seemed to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the oheek with a ray of lead light weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiclritios caused bim to be invited to every fè; all wanted to see it, and those who had been used to excite violence, and now felt the weight of en nui, were happy to have something in their presence able to engage their attendees. In spite of the deadly tint of her foe, which neuor gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or shook the strong emotion of passiori, despite its shape and its contours were beautiful, many female hunters after the natoriity tried to gain her attention, and gclin, ot leasl, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who was badly mocked by a monster of urery worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw the herself into her way, and did anything but put on a dress of a mantebank, to attract her step of ice :— although in vain :— when he stood before him, although his eyes were close fixed on her's, he still seemed as if they were unperceived ;— even his inapplauded iinconce wcls baffled, and she left the field. But although the adulterative common cannot inflect every the guidance of his eyes, it is not that the female sex they were indifferent to him: however, such was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent daughter woman, that few knew that Hecver was speaking to semeos. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and that it was that even sherried the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was as hortery among the women who make up the boast of the same role of their domestic virtues, as among those who shove him by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came in London a gentleman thing by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by the parents who died when he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was only necessary to take care of fortune, while they abandoned the more important charge of his mind to take care of the suballerne mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this feeling of honor and high-romantic frankness, which destroys so many apprentices every day. He believed everything to sympathize with nature, and thought that the vico was thrown away by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted more in the tasting of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in spite, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. It was beautiful, frarik, and rich: for various reasons, when it enters gay circles, many mothers sneak into bim, striating what portrays the least truth, their languishing or grotesque favourites: the daug-\nAt the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he was led into false notions of his tales and his merit. Attached as he was to the ram of solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and wax candles that sparkle, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no finding in the life of recall for any of these congreries of pleasant images and tough descriptions in these volumes, of what he had formed his studies. On the other hand, a little money in the vanity of gratified bis, it was absolute to reread his dreams, when the extraordinary bell that we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the vory impossibility of forming an idea of the carocler of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gauges a few other signs of obserty of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by avoiding the contact tbeir: allowing his irnagination to image every time the propensity to the extravagance of ideas, he soon formed this object to the berg0 of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the persori assimilate it. He became active with him, paid him attention, and if the sar has advanced in his opinion, that his present has been rehearsed always. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens quarters were embarrasods, and he soon found, from the notes of the preparation on the street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain some informal respeeling this Sirigular character, which, until now, had directly struck his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, it was time for him to execute the taur, which for many rites was bougbl necessary for enoble yaung to take a few quick steps in the career of justice towards putti and themselves on an equality with the ogés, and not to allow them to appear as if flalleri froin the sky, when never scaridalovs intrigues are chinned as subjects of the acceptable or phrase, according to the degree of competence they have had in the realization of the latter. They consented: and Avbrey immediately evoking the Bi intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fall....\nHe accepted it with joy, and in a few days they passed through the water.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now it found that, although much more busy actions had been exposed to his life, the results offered different conclusions of apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, reappeared from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not avoid making remarks, because it was not on the virtuous and reddish iridence of the companion, even on the virtuoso, that he lowered his cells ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely removed; And when he proclinated to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wallow in lust hjs, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of vicious tho, which usually prevails over the retirement of the virulent indigents. There were only circumstances about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed up0 in his mind: any lhose upon which it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all led to the sea, or sunk at the lowest and the most abstract mystery. In Brussels and through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised to the apparent impatience of which his companion sought the entrances of all vicc in fashion; there he entered into the entire spirit at the table of faro: he bet, and played always successfully, exoperated where the best known was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, if he met the eruption young novice, or did it without chance of a nunnery family; then his very will pay the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the world Iaid spirit, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the dead hal mouse. In each city, he left the youth formerly trifle, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sat that had drawn him into the reach of this friend; wbilst much a father sitting fraritic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, or with even buying enough for faculty there present envy. But who did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the conuulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was rioting, however, capable of ooinbatiring the eunning of the ex-\n- Yeah, that is right. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of Al, and did not fear himself for his own benefit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he gave him the opportunity to speak to him openly and openly; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthuen in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the samo: his eye spoke less than his lip; and the gypsy Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no greater gratification of it than the constant excitement of wanting to break the that rnysteria, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something punctual.\nThey arrived on Romc, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room in the morning circus of an Italian country, as he set out to search for the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he impatiently worked; the first woes of his sister, breathing not passing but affection; the others were of his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had brought into his imagination that the threshing was an evil power residing in his companion, they began to waste sufficient reason for belief. His guards insist on his immediate departure from his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been denied that his contempt for the insult had not been generated by the hatred of the hercharacter; but he had asked, to revive his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be driven out of the pincle of virtue vnsullicd, dowri at the lowest abyss of infamy and endowment: in the end, tell all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, hod, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey disbanded by leaving one, of which the character had not yet shown a luminous point single on which to remain the eye. He refused to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, in order, in the sense, to do so more closely, so as not to allow light circles to pass without being warned of them. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his secretary was bereaved to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is Seldam that an unmarried woman is met in the house; he was obliged to land on her plans in secret; but Aubreys eye littered with him in all his similif, and soon disavowing that an examination had been appointed, which would probably spoil an innocent, though an unimaginable girl. He did not waste time seizing Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked Hiin to respect the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet his teacher last night. Lord Ruthven replied that his indentions were such that he would have had on such an occasion; and after pressing whether he intended to marry him, simply risk. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that fram at that time, he must declare to accompanying his leadership in the rest of the projected term, he commissioned his service to search for other apartments, and called the lady to another, the infinite of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven merely told his scout that he had fully consented to a separation; but he did not imply that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nFearing that Rome, Aubrey, would take his steps towards Greece, and cross the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon he took care to trace the faded traces of glory ancestralized on monuments which, apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freedom only before the slaves, had often hidden them under the sheltering ground or many lichen hearts. Under the same roof as the swallow, expulsed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have bewitched the model of a pclinter wanting to pour on the carivass to be promised a ditful osthe hope in Mohammeds parcldis, savo that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that it could be thought to belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plane, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle, a bad type of hcr bercles; for whom would exchange the hcroeil, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxury look asleep of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kafhmere bulterfly, showed all the beauty of his form, sloatiring as he was on the wind, to the gasc avid of him, who forgot the letters that he had just decypbcred upori an almosa spelled talet, in the contemplation of his sylpha-like figure. Oflen wanted his false braids, as she flattered around, to expose in the ray of the s such a brilliant tely delica and quickly erase the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antjquarian, who lev escapes from his mind the object that he had before thought of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and astonishment balls. As he drew the remains which he wanted to present a memorial during the next few hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she then described him the circular dance on the open plain, painted to him in all the brilliant colors of youthsul memory, the marriage pump that she remanifested viewing in her irony; and then, turning to sub-jocts that had evidently made a greater impression on her mind, told him all the superriatural talks of her nurse. His gains and his apparent belief in what she narrated, even aroused Aubreys interest; and often as she told him the story of the living Uampyre, which he had spent years in the midst of his finances, and the most expensive, forced each year, feeding on a beautiful semalc to prolong his existence for the months that followed, his blood would run cold, while trying to laugh at so much inside and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted him the riames of oldrnen, who had at last detected one living between them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the friend's appetite; and when she found them so unbelievable, she begged him to flout it, if he had noticed that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had evidence that dazzled them, with grief and sorrow, to convince her. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and this horror was increased, haunting a fairly precise description of Lord Rulhven; he, however, still persisted on persuading her, that thore could 6 th na truth in his fears, although at the same shot he won to the mary coricidencos who had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthuens supernatural tho power.\nAubrey began to cling more to eat; his innocent, so contrasted with all the virtues of the women among whom he had sought for. bis, vision of romance, gained his heart; and that he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, still found himself more and more ottachod to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself from the ottimes from it, and, forming a plan for the resecration of antiquarians, he set out, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he was always able to keep his attention to the rising upwards around him, and in his mind he retained an irnogue which seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and always was the same insantile frankness being that he had known for the first time. She always seemed part of him with roluclarice; but it was necessary she had rio rio more than someone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some strange that bad yet escapes from the destructive hand of time. Such had appeared to your parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several prefent, affirmed their existence, people with horror in the name itself. Soori afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which was to hold him sor for a few hours; when they bearded the name of the place, all at the same time, that he was obliged not to return to the night, as he should not pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after the poorly closed day, upon any consideration. They described it as the rest of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey rnade the light of their representations, and tried to get them out of the idea; bul when he saw them trembling at his drawing so to mock a superiar, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThen Aubrey set out unattendedly; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of the Bi host, and worried about sinning his words, mocking the bolief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with an unfortunate terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and shook him fervently for the return, and by the night passed the power of these buildings was put into action; he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that-doylumer would soon be found, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the glass classmates, so fast to gather in a huge mass, and paur ail their rage on the devoted land .— He finally arched, mounted his horse, determined to mako by the speed for his delay: hut he waf too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediately, the sun sets, the night begins: and it had advanced far, the power of the wild star above—the thunders failing had barely a resting interval—its heavy rain forced its way through the leafago of the canopy, while the blue lightning worked seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse snuffed straight, and he was carried with a terrible speed to the entangled forest. The animal finally, by fatigue, stopped, set in motion, by the dazzling of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a bowl that hardly rose from the masses of dead lcaves and a brush that surrounded it. Move, he approaches, hoping to find one to guide him to town, or a confident place to get the storm enclave. As he approached, the lunders, for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation, exulting or a laugh, continued iri sound almost intact ;— he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door or the cabin to operate. He threw it into total darkness: the sound, however, guided it. He was apparently answered; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no note was taken of the film. He found himself in the tacl with someone whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out :\" Again mocked !\" to that a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt eaten by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life very dearly, he read; but he fought in vain; he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his beak, had put his hands bis on his throat illuminating the day, disturbed him ;— he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in common the crasbiring of the branches, as he broke the wood, was heard rio longer. The agenda of the meeting was now clear; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by these shortcomings. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the valleys of the mvd, and the stubble loaded on each straw with large soft straws. To Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was again left in the darkness; but what horror his horror, when the high of the torches of Tbe burst once out of the mare on hiin, to perceive the aerial form of beautiful hls conductor brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was an raising vision of the disturbed imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but it was a silence lowering his foot which seemed almost as boring as the life that once lived there :– on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :– At that man pointed, wept, struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A lilter formed quickly, and Aubrey got tired alongside her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now falling with the flower of life that had dragged in her. He did not know who his thoughts were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held unconsciously almost in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for beer when a mother had misod. Their apparent cries, also they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible cotastrophe. \"To describe their fault would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to Corsica .\" They were inconsolable; bobb died in the heart of broken.\nAubrey being pvt in bed was seized with the most folding fever, and was often delirjovs; in these intervals it would be equal to Lord Ruthvcn and on Ianthe — why an inexplicable combination it seemed the men of his former companion for sparo loved hc. At other times, he impregnated the maldictions on his head, and cursed him as his destrayer. John Rutbven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of Hlm, whose image he now had in common with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his words, was very repentant in his words for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. He seemed to have changed his seniority; he appeared only the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his evalesceress began to rush, he gradually withdrew to the same state of mirid, and Aubrey did not see any difference compared to the old man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on the back, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile hau-\nThat is him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to swallow up the tideless waves raised by the cold breozo, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, still fun ;— lended, he seemed to want avoid the eye of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrecy, by this sbock, was much defiled, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lard Ruthven; but as long as he wanted him for solitude, his mind could not find him in the TB of At hens; if he looked for him in the midst of the ruins, he used to frequent, ancient shape stood by his side – if he were looking for him in the TB wood, his slight step seemed to be wandering around amputating the undergrowth, the quest for purple modest; then turned abruptly around, showing, with wild imagination, his pale and wounded face lhroat, with a gentle smile upon his lips. How determined to steal scenes, all the characteristics of which cracked these bitter associations in the high spirit. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he bound himself the tender clerk whom he had taken from him during his illness, to visit the parts of Greece neither still seen. They went in all directions, and sought every place to remember and to remember what they were looking at; but thus they seized from one place to another, but they did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually implored to lighten the class reports, which they were trying to invent only individuals who were interested in exciteing the generosil of those they were defending against alleged dangers. As a result, the council of the inhabitants, on occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a tornado, with large masses of rock descended from neighboring precipices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their head, and by the choed ratio of the several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind the rocks, had weapons to fire in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthucn and Aubrey, imitating their exarnple, withdrew for a moment, in spite of the sheltering of the defilement: but shameful to be so detained by an enemy, who, with insulting blows, advanced them, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thugs were to climb above and take him to the rear, they immediately discouraged the rushing of the enemy's search. They had hardly raised the shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to a grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer attentive to the side or to his own peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — bis guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, impenetibly thrown his arms and over-endormated.\nBy promises of hail, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; arid having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence – they simply kept the entrance until their comrade came back with the sum given, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthuen quickly became disordered; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to be advancing with hasty steps. His coricul and his appetite had not changed; he sowed as unconscious of the pain as he had been obsessed with him; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who was led to offering his asfistanoe with mare that the fervor of soul –\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I watch out for the death of my existence as little as that of the day of the Passiring; but you can save my honor, your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I do anything, Aubrey .—\" I need a little bull — my life quickly panics — I don't explain everything — but if you hid everything you know ine, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death did not take place for some time in England — I — but life. \"-\" We don't know him. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up violently ,\"Swear by all your soul that by all your nature you swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any calamity, no matter what happens, or whatever you can see. \"If eyes fainted from their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing on his pillow, arid no longer breathed.\nA brey withdrew to rest, but did not stop; the many circumstances that were present at his ascendant with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered a cold chill, he came from him, as if he were coming from the present of something horrific that awaited him. The ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri that he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was not longer there, having been conveyed by himself orid comrades. At the moment he was retiring, the pinaole of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they should give his seigneury, tal he should expose to the first cold ray of the moon that the rose of his death. Aubrey had the climax, and took several men, decided to go and cook it on where it is. But there is no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the robbers swore to indicate the identicol rock on which they put the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a stream in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and iri that all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resisted leaving him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or to Naples, he composed his sons by arranging the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been one case containing several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While returning and examining their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dogger discovered in the fatal heat — he trembled — rushing to get the stealthy proof, he found a weapon, and his borror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, though probably shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; yct still, he wanted to disbelieve; but the particular shape, the same shades variable on the haft and sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and did not leave the room for the owt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were about the lady he had tried to capture Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. His parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and the case had not been heard since the Ibe départementuro of his secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated borbors; he feared that this lady had fallen a victim to the Santa destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dearly. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed to be abiding at his will, soon gallothed him on the English coast; and he welcomed him to the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, the shoe was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had a riot that winning a circle which wins the gaze and applause of the drawlng-room assembled. There was no light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His body blood was never lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not seem to arise from the misfortune, the bvl of some sentiment inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was rioting that light soot, which misleads whenever a butterfly color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When Alorie, her face was never illuminated by his smile, but when her dream.\nAnd in her presence, would she forget the sorrows she knew had caused at her rest, who would have exchanged her flow for that of the eluptary? It seems flexible as if these eyes — this face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, he had been thought by his guardians more appropriate than his presentation should be 6 th delay the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be a protector. It was now that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, had to be the time of the beer entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey preferred to bring back to his father's private hotel, and he had had enough of the insurance who surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the coldest of the most fashionable, when the big spirit had been so hot by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to his sister's protection job. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd of the table was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and also who was uncomfortable to rest in the mile of royally, hastened to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner, without being conned, he remembered that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that plain, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his eternity ,\" Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a spectre that would blow up the hjm, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his attention or this place when he first entered the si city. He went away until the limbs almost looked like carrying their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and in anticipation of a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and he led to the house. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, because he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again in front of him — Star circumstances —\n— He woke him up, he could believe it was possible — death has risen in the past !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image if Mirid was rested.\nMove in. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for if he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name during his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there stood back up his own devouring thoughts. As they departed, many people woke up and entered another room, and found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a real conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one of them asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those features which he abhorred most. And he went forth, and took hold of the arm of his sister, and, with a hasty step, gave him up to the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing over them, be again heard that voico murmured unto him :\"Remember the oalh !\" — He did not turn, but sent his sister, soori came to him.\nAubrey has become very distracted. So much so that his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the inonster living has again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed her to explain to her what had caused her sudden conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His death surprised him ;—did he allow this monster to wander, to ruin the breath of it, to destroy all that he held dear, and not to rule out his progress? His sister was stained by HLM. But if we were to break his oath, and reveal a brief suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world such a wretched; but death, he remembered, had already been crippled. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, which did not eat and did not eat until his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, being no longer able to bear the stillness and loneliness, he left his house, with a street to street, anxious to steal this haunted image of this. His dress became neglected, afraid he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight humidity. He was not dropped at the 6th recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon dislodged by him who fled from a swister pursuer than any thought. His conduct, however, weldly loaded. Struggled with the thal ho idea left behind by his entire tho absence of his friends, with a friend among them, whose their presence was unconscious, he decided to enter again in society, and watch a bim classly, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, the glances of haggard and suspicion were so intriguing, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg of him for a bathtub to seek, for her, the society that offended HLM so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved navailing, the guards thought it was appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that Aubrey parents had imposed on them before.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered during his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what was considered madness, they engaged the aphysicist to reside at the fair time and take care of him. He seemed to notice it, if the spirit was completely absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherent bee at the tip so big, that it was confined to his room. He is often lying there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his cyes had reached a vitreous chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory remaining appeared on his sister's training; then which would begin something, and, shaking his hands, with the thal appearances seriously distressed, he would make her pass so as not to touch the hive. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your look is for me, fuck him !\" When, however, she asked whom he referred to, her only answer was :\"True! True !\" And once again he sank into a state, when riots even if she could wake him up. However, little by little, as the eyecler passed, his incoherenes became less frequent, and his mind mingled with a part of his morosity, while his guardians observed, tall severcll t miss the day he counted on his fingers, a certain numberer, and then smiled.\nThe lime had almost fainted, when, at the top of the year, one of his guardians had started to talk to his doctor about the melancholy situation of Africa in such a awful situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was instantly drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expression bis iritontiori to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister here. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his fisher was with him. He was apparently again able to be asphyxiated by the influence of his pretty girlfriend; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed his cheek, with tears, freaking out at the thought of his brioche once again alive to linger on feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his arid fulfillment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, what was his surprise to contemplate the features of the monster who had so long infunished his life. He captured the portrait of a paroxysm of rage, and trampled under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future busbarid, he looked as if he did not understand it, then took hold of his hands, arid looking at her with a serious expression of the spirit, he swore that which would never marry this monster, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that if that voice again sade hirn remembered his oath — he suddenly turned, thinking that Lord Ruthuen was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the physicjan, who had heard the whole, and thought that this would be a return to his disorder,\nAnd enchanting Miss Aub Rey, he wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, he begged, he begged them to die, but for one day. They, attracting this to the insanity they imagined, had taken possession of the spirit of the hls, advanced to pocify it, and retired.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the living room, and he refused all the others. What did he hear about Aubrey's disease, that he understood himself as the cause of this disease, but that he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this information. Ho hastened to go to the house of his former companion, and, by the hard presence, and the great pretension of the bone for the brother and the interest in his falsity, he graduatedly from the ear of Miss Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to retract—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being from the overcrowded earth, unless he saw her to whom he addressed ;—could say how, since he knew, his exile, had begun to see worthy of conservation, if he were only that he could listen to your aocents asothing ;— in the end, he knew whether would how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his affiliations. The title of the eldest branch fell to him in length, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in fear of his brother's disturbed state ,) which had to take place the day before the departure of the hls for the Continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and his guards, amputated to bribo the servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, accompanying her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own book, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for the birds that graze, on which they denounce the heavy curses of the moss. The servants promised that they would untie him; but give him to the physicist, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubreys mind any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without a rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the busy bones nates preparation. The morning came, and the noise of the pickles broke on his ear. The baby grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, the graduation slole away, leaving the hive in the custody of an old defenseless woman. He seized the supply, and one of them was out of the room, and in a moment he found himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm hy force, rushed home from the room, speechless with fury. When he was on the Stock, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my 6th day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his ants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to pick him up. Aubrey could not bear him himself; his wind of fury had broken a blood vessel, and he was in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he got away, as the doctor is afraid of agitating. The marriage was dissolved, and the bride married left London.\nAubreys weakness increases; of blood shed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted the guards of his sister to be able to call, and when midnight had struck, he reported what the reader had lost — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians had to protect Miss Aubrey; but they arrived, it was too much to eat. Lord Ruthven had spoken, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the hair of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to ruin his resting place, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certain cattle and vegetables still at 6 th had there, led many British ships to visit — both men of war and merchontmen; and it is rather out of the water for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the violation of a voyage. We landed, like usual, at the bolt of the bay, and while the men were employed to water, and the shipowner negotiated for the cattle with the nativos, the ecclesiastical and the myself at or a ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we had the spirit of a young Greek as a guide over, who told us that he came from Scio with an English lord, but for fear that the bitter islarid before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me like a plot ,\" said Tbe Grec ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose a suit Mililene, where I am likely to marry. He was anodized, but he was a good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to hjm, and he left an old mcln in charge of him: who gave Dominick, the merchant of wine, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and sold there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he will say in his felucca very often to the difference islands .\"\nThis account exalted our very mulled claries, and we did not waste any time hastening at the house that our peasant had resigned. We were graciously received by an old man who led us to the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, an ensiling parlover, and a bed room, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green-coloured walls, rallies tablacs on the other side, a large bluertle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed source on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the surniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane armchairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, or only one painting. The bedroom had only one largo mattress extending the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. We blocked a marble niche. Once the old man told us, chained with books and papers, which were then in the chest of a sailor of hell in the near: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contents. Ori the tablet of recreation poses Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and Rausseau works complete; Volley's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the language of Germari; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mellton's Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinoplc, much torn, but no English books of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribed everywhere, and marked with briefs of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, he must lie there until his return; for he is so special, that if I renounced a thing without order, he would frown on Rene for a week together; this and always very good. I have done him a service, and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Arnenian who rcslides in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought berodrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was folding. The portico ln frorit was in bad steps Iong and fourteen wide, and the canned marble pillars with black plants and nice cargo-work work horns (as it is now the usual architecture in Greek ), were confidentially grower than le roos. The roof, surrounded by a clear balustrade, was covered with a fine cherry earpiece, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most housetops are furnished, and on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we buried the house, a stream of srall slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back, on which we were told, the lord spent mary from his evenings until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" exclaimed the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very devoted...\njust ,\"and always attended our church twice a week, beside Sundays\".\nThe view from this wall seat, which can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, and to the top of it, of which an ancient Greek dull appeared in the majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost like the base of the dead nature wads. The sea smooth as grass, and a colourless horizon with a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a lilte on the left, near a view of the Ohsnut and the lofty palm trees, several small islands unctuously observed, studying light blue waves with spots of emerald green. I felt enjoyed a view more than I did that; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Tbe Arminari\" said over the doctor ,\"could say it, but I sure he won ,\"—\"And can you say it, old friend ?\" I said —\"If I am ashamed ,\" he says ,\" I don't dare .\" We did not take a shot to visit the Armenian, but on over back in the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. Ho hod shared eight young girls when he was last upon the island, and baked with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave GreekTestaments to the poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we co-elected, to have been a very ecological and caring character. We learned the circumstances, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to dissociate. He had a very beautiful daughter, with which the lard was often seen walking on the seafront, and he bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we left the pious island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the table rack, guessing that this rambler is Greece called being. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and moreover those ecclesialities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our entire daughter was disappointed. Failing Compones with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byrori; I greet him in my travels on the Ifland of Tenedos, arid I also visited the hive in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordship, as we had been bad a few years home fram; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put on our heels, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on the excessive page. We deeply regret not having been more curious about our research at the cottage, but we corisolcid nevertheless with the idea of returning to Mitylene a future day; but to me that day never resumes. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good dream of her lordship, who was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, averse to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its foreheads, or to add lots of measures. The made is directly the inverse, the bone can be collected plalily from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, his elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark them as a being on the heart of quisc Reljgion bath has put his seal, and on the head of which Benevolence has cast his intention. No man can take the previous \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as an emissary. With regard to his love or plea, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports are never received with cash --\nion, particularly when directed against the moral integrity of man; arid be able to justify himself before that the horrible court where all must appear, clone can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Making a good secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "1": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe Simpertition on which his tale is based is general in the East. Among the Arahians, he seems to be emmon: he did not, hawever, extend his sons to the Greoks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he took his present form only since the division of Latin and Grekchurches; to which time, the idea of becoming dominant, thethal Lalin body could not drink so drunk in their territory, he gradually irritated, and formed the subject of wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their gravins, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the Wells, it spread, with some slight variations, garlic on Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the bolief existed, that vampyres night soaked some of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while these hum a fattened blood sucker — and their carbon veins distend the state of repletion, cells to cause blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even pores from their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is a curious and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hungary. It seems that on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, the latter confronted each other in a urianimous manner, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had heard that, in Cassavia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of himself, eating part of the land of the vampy grove and rubbing himself with his blood. However, this measure did not prevent him from becoming a computer himself; for twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being massacred by him, and a deposit was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other malices, the inhabitants built their Hadagni, took the body of Tbe, and found (as it supposed to be usual in the case of vampyrianism) fresh, and completely free of corruptian, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and fiorid blood. Having thus been obtained, this is a problem that is currently facing us. A whole stake leads entirely through Arnold Pavl's heart and body, where he would have dared over as terribly as if he had been alone. This dono cut his head off, burned his body, arid threw ashes into his grave. The same mocles were adopted with the curses of the Persians who had died before of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyr becomes himself a vompyre, and sucks in his turn.\nThe Chief of Ballistics.\nThis monstrous rodomontode is linked here, because it seems better suited to lustrate the sub-ject of the present observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to limit his infernal actions only to the beings he loved to inoster on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, as Vampyre did, thy horn shall be torn from her back; then aunt the natius piece, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence thy daughter, sister, wifo, about midnight drain the stream of life; Turn off the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid, thy victims, or they still expire, Shalje knows the devil for their sire; as ye cursed them, thy flowers are wilted upon the stem of TBA. If a goal for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shail bless you with the name of a father — This word should envelop your heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the 1st tint of His cheek – the last spark of his eye, And the last glanoe glassy must see Who releases 2 is his lifeless blue; Thon with the tear without bean The glasses of his yellow hair, Os which, in the lift a lock when the most expensive money of Afficejon was worn — But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! But with your best blood, your grinning tooth,\nthen talking to your full gravo, Go – and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who harror get away from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr Southey Bos also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arabic Orieiza, who was represented as having returned from the grave in order to torture him that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to have caused the sin of her life, since she is protrayed throughout the male bone, a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of amazing cases of vampyrifm, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmodot, in hif great work upon this subject, ignores a variety of anecdotes, and the traditional narrators have given examples of his effects, low put forth some dissertalists loarned, harassing to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about its superstition might be added; even if the present may suffice to the limits of a no time, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations otlenting upon a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parts of the shields of the ton, more remarkable for its singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the branch attracted only its talent, so that it could be by a lover, and cast fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt the feeling of apprehension could not explain where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring at the obitects space, did not sow to penetrate, and to the eye of the anne to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of leaderi that weighed on the skin that he should not pass. All wanted to see him, and those who had been called upon to violate the excitement, and now the weight of boredom, were raining to have something in their presence plan to engage their attention. Despite the sweet shade oshis faco, which has never gained a warmer shade, either from the modesty of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, many female hunters have tried to gain its attachments, and to win, at least, the same darkness of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of any monster sewn in the drawing-rooms since her marriage, has thrown himself in her way, and has done anything but put oribe robe in vain :— when she stood before him, it seemed that her eyes were fixed on her, but it seemed that they were not understood ;— even her unapplied impudence was basfled, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not irfluence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the cautian appearance with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, whom few ever knew which addressed women. He had, rainbow, the reputation of a winning language; and, let it be euon overcome the dread of his singular character, as that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vigo, he was also often among the thofian women who formed the van of lhoirex of their domestic virtues, like Arnong thase who shook him by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came your London, a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great woman, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned his important rnore charge of his mind to the custody of merconarian subalterns, he cultivated more his iinaginatian than his judgment. He had, bence, a high romantic feeling of good and candour, which every day runs so many learnings of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was incrusted by Providence simply for the piclorosque effect of the scene, as we see it in romances: he bought that the misery of an inerly coniferous cottage in vestibular clots, which were also hot, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and patches of variof color. In the end, he learned that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when entering gay circles, the many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languissiring or grumpy favorites: the girls at the same time, by their tight faces which he bent, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the rostrum of the hours solitary bis, he was surprised at finding, that, except in the high down and wax candles that sniffed, not of the presence of a ghost, but of lack of sriuffling, there was no findatien in true life for any of the congreries of that of pleasant pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, of which he had formed his glow. By finding, however, some compensation in his grotified vanity, he is about to re-read his dreams, what is the extraordinary being we described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who had as many signs of his obfervation of oxternal object, as the tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to cut off all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the thls objoct irito the hero of cl romanco, and decided to observe the offspring of this fantasy, rather than the person before him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far the advice on his opinion, that his presonic has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and he soon found, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was at six o'clock to travel. Desirous of obtaining information on this singular character, which, now, had struck his curiosity, he hined to his guards, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been necessary to enoble the young to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice to put on an eqvality with the elderly, and not allow them to appear as if fallen from the sky, whenever soandal intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantry or praise, according to the degree of the competence of shewri to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his interests to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to receive him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently had no hanging iron common with other men, he willingly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHthorto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthvon's character, and now he found that, although many of his cliquetis were exposed to his point of view, the results offer conclusionians different from the reasons apparent to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle wanderer, arid the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not begin to point out that he was not even virtuous, reduced to indignation by the dishonest assistants, even on virtve, that he gave his olms ;- these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligclte came to ask for something, not to relieve his guards, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. It was, commenting, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails on the retirement of the virtuous indiggent. There was a circle around the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: grip those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the lhescaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubr ey was surprised to the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centers of all the Fashionabe vice; he entered into the spirit at the Fara table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always the face without change, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, Thus, when he encountered the Yovthful voice eruption, or the unlucky father of a large family; then his very desire seemed very well the law of — this apparent abstraction of the mind was removed, and his eyes sparkled with more fire than the cat half while delirling with the dead mouse half. In the city of Cvery, he left the youth formerly flocked, torn from the circle he adorned, cvsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falsity that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the dreadful eyes of children hungry for mule, without a single farthing of his immense latc wealth, where to buy enough bishops to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruining tho of many, the last dorlot that he had just pulled himself out of the convulsive catch of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, the struggle against the most experienced cursing. Aubrey often wanted to deny this to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure that ravaged the ruin of AlI, and did not tend to make Brown profits ;— but he did — every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frantically and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthvenin, his car, in the middle of the varia...\nour wild andrich sense of nature, has always been the same: his eye is flattered less than his lip; and though Aubrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he has obtained no gratification grafting from it that the confit excites vainly want to break this mystery, which at this exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost the sight of his companion; either left home in the daily ottendononce in the morning circle of a Countess of Italy, he wept in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters secured from England, which he opened with eagor impatient; the first was to his sisler, breathing nothing but the faction; the others were frustrated with his guards, the latter astonished hjm; if it had been necessary in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him a sufficient reason for the helief. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend and urged him to attack his character in an ulcerative manner, as the possession of irresistible poachers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contract for adultery had not generated iri hatred of beer characler; but that he had demanded, to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the portion of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of unwelded virtue, down from the abyss af infclmy and degradation: in the end, that all the males whom he sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the moss aside, and had not scrupulously to expose the deformity of their vices to public folly.\nAubrey determined on the lectving one, whose cabarotter had not yet shown a single point bright ori that rested the eye. He tried again to invent a pretext of a place to abandon him altogether, to seek, in some time, to monitor him more closely, and not to leave light circumstances unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with iri basety; so he was obliged to take care of her plans in secret; but Aubreys eye dazzled her in all her feelings, and soon discussed that an assignment had been designated, which would probably have arisen in the ruin of an innocent and thoughtless girl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthvens applause, and suddenly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her at the same night. Lard Ruthveri became weaker, and his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an accasiori; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; he immediately wrote a note, to say, that from that time, he must describe accompanying his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit to their. He ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and appeal to the mother of the lady, informed her all bones to be known, not only to his daughter, but also onerning the character of his Lordship. The Assing Nation has been proven. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his handmaid to warn his full assertion to a solution; but did not mention any suspicion of his having been plans thwarted by Aubrey's iriterposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the periinsula, soon found himself in Atbens. He then fixed the residence of his in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to draw up the records erased of clincific glory upon monuments which apparently, shameful to time the acts of free men only before the splashes, were hidden under the floor sheltering lichen color. Under the same roof as hell, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to spread on the cariva as he promised the hope of the faithful in the Mohammed period, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that he might belong to those who do not make mistakes. As she danced on the side of the mountain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it was said that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for those who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for a drowsy luxury look of the adapted animal but to the taste of an epic. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the poisonous young girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, showed the beauty that of his form, flocking as he was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylpha figure. Often, his braids would fall, as some flitted arourid, expose in the ray of the sun, such delicately bright and fastly fading hves, just might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the object very stand before thinking of vital importance to the good interpretation of a passage inPausanias. But why try to describe charms feel everything, but no cari appreciates it ?— It was innocent, youth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wished to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and galvanized the magic effect of the bis pencil, tracing the scencs of her native place; which would then describe him the entourage of the open plain, would be pale, to him in all the luminous colors of turbulent memory, the marriage pump that she reformulated when seeing iri his childhood; and there, turning to the subjects that had indeed made a greater impression on the mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of his nerve. Her fervour and her apparent conviction of what she told, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a loving woman to spread her existence during the months that followed, her blood ran cold, wbilst he tried to get her out of so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had at last detected a connection among them. After several of their close relatives and children had found marked with the stamp of the friends appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for he had not dared to question their existence, had always had a proof that required him to confess, with pain and tear. She gave him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise desorption of the Lord Rulhuen; however, he persuaded her again by persuading her, that there would be a true truth in her fears, though at the same time marveled at many coincidences that all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rutbven.\nAuhrey began to attach him more and make to him; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affutiated virtues of women among the women he had sought for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young year of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more attached to the almost magical form before him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian search, he went away, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the brief attention on the ruins of Tbe around him, while in his mind he resisted an irritation which seemed to be the sole possessor of whispers. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was still the same child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to share from bim with reluotance; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite hauntings, when guarding walls occupied to sketohing or to rip a fragment had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the underjeet of Vampyres, and both, with several present, aborted their existence, a pale of horror to the namo itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubreydeterms to carry out one of his exercises, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard Tbo narne from the place, all in one stroke begged him not to return at night, because he must pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the mcly had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the hell who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made many of their representations, and tried to brighten them with the idea; but when he saw that the cm trembled with bis, so dared to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Avbrey went on his excursion without lingering; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was amazed to find words, mocking the calamities of these horrible engagements, who inspired them with such terror. When he had the absurdity of leaving, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night crew allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day was going to end soori, and that there was one of the specks thase whieh, iri thick warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring out all their rage from the country doubly .— He at least, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. Twice, in these climates of southern, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the slorm was above — his thunders failed had barely a rest interval — his heavy rain takes on himself through the shell of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and crash at his feet. Suddenly, his horse took frigbt, and he was carrified with a terrible speed through the wood set in motion. The animal finally, through satlgue, stopped, and found, by the glare of Iightning, that he was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not remove 1 f from the masses of dead lcaves and 6 brushy w which surrounded. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him on the town, or at least confident to get a shelter against the storm basin. As he approached, the Lunders, for a silent moment, gave him the opportunity to hear the horrific cry of a woman who mingled with suffocated laughter, exulting, continued in an almost unspoilt on ;— he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder which agairi rolled on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, for, he called, the sounds continued, and nothing noticed him. He found himself in a contract, a man whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out :\" Again gagged !\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt the sons struck by one whose strength seemed fuperhuman: demise yourself to sell his life as so dear cles that he could, he slipped; but it was in vain: he was lifted up with an unormo-vapante force against the ground :- his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled to his chest, had put his hands on his throat; when the dazzling a lot of torches penetrating into the hole that gave the light in the light in the light, disturbed him;- he surprisingly rouged, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now motionless; and Aubrey, incomparable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, and the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and arid the thatch loaded on each straw with heavy soft straws. Al Aubreys desire was sought, which had drawn him by his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, jumping as he was but an arrogant version of his disturbed imagination; but to be again seen the same form, when being unolosed them, stretched by his fidelity. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as attacking as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was stuffed, and on his throat were the marks of having opened the vein :— that is how men pointed, crying, at the same time struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter quickly formed, arid Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now filled with a photo flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his dolphins were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge vacant iri — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger bone, a particular construction, which had been his in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engulfed in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a dreadful disaster. \"Now their sorrow would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at the allergy, and pointed to Corsica. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAvbrey being pvt in bed was seized of a very violent fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he called on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe — by some incomprehensible combination, it seemed your head of his companion before sparo the bin that he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, who has now been given the opportunity to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing the state of Avbroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his consultant waiting. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of a hlm which he had now combined with the image of a Vompyre; Paul Lord Ruthven, by kind bis words, involving almost repentance for the fault thal bod caused separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, and carcaille which he showed, soon refreezing to his presence. His leadership seemed completely changed; he no longer appreciated this apathetic feeling which had so appeased Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalescence began to accelerate, he gradually withdrew the into from the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not see any difference with the old man, except that at the same time he was surprised to mellow his eyes firmly fixed on him, with a smile of malicjoy exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, LordRuthven was apparently committed to observing the tidal waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs,circling, like our world, the inoveless smile ;— tired, which seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had once disturbed him so much would be concerned that he had fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but much that he wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he had flourly frequented, the shape of Ianthe food by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then turning suddenly, would show, with wild imagination, his pale face on the wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he remembered being bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, to visit these parts of Greee, and you had not seen. They went in all directions, and joined the recognition of the wish; but they hadtened out of the place, and did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually implored these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from claimed dangers. As a result of this, the Council of the\nAbitants, on one occasion, they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as a guide than a dogma. On entering, However, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the tourbillon was the back of a torrent, with great inasses of rock descended from the neighbouring prefectures, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for hardly the whole party was engaged in the narrow past, which were surprised by the whistling of bulls near their heads, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, they had begun to move towards the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, in imitating their example, withdrew far behind the sheltering turn of defilement: but shameful to be thus detained by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, advanced them, and to be expiated at the desistling massacre, if one of the thieves should go up above and take them there, they dissuade both from the rusb towards the front of the enemy search. They had a little shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to escape from his frame; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, the season was surprised to see the fans of the robbers around him — his guards having, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately turned their arms back on their way.\nBy the promises of a large row, Avbrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby oabin; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were more content to keep the entrance until their comrade Shauld returned with the promised sum, for there was an order. Lord Ruthvenly rapid strength diminished; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty stops. His coricul and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, the boss and became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help more than the usual solicitation —\" Help me! I mean not my life, I have listened to the date of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need a little — rny life ebbs apace — I cannot explain the whole — but if you concalized everything you know, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — arid if death rain was unknown to a man in England — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying nan, rising up with a culta nt violico ,\"Swear by all your soul, searching for your nature, swear that if a year happens to you and one day you give to your knowledge of my crimes or date to every living being in any way whatsoever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was running down his pillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the mary circuses assisting him in his knowledge of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came over, as if he were presenting something horrifying waiting for him. At the beginning of the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he left the corpse badly, when a thief the mcl, and informed him that it was not lordy there, the baguant was transmitted by himSi et oomrades, at his retirement, the pirinacle of a neighbouring munl, agreed to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the baby moon that struck his death. Aubrey marveled, and struck several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But when he had had fun at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or drapes, the thieves welded that they had pointed the same stone on the which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was embellished by conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the purpose for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superslitic melancholy which had sequestered upon the basic spirit, he resolved to leave JT, arid soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Noples, he occupied the deer in the organization of these effects, he had with him belonging to Lord Steven. Among other things, there were weapons of supply, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were dangers and attacks. While turning them, and calculating their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with jntbe samc flyle that one discovers in the front hut — he trembled — hastening to get additional evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equipping, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need to be more energizing — they seemed gastric to be related to daggor; however, he still wanted to be wary; but the particular shape, some shades carrying upan the shaft and sheath were similar in splendor in both, and there was no room for duty; there were also drops of blood on the axe.\nHe left Smyrna, and when he returned to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to rip out Lord Ruthueri seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune was flowing, and it had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of the anti-seaster. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postiliori, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon wasted half of the English shorks; and he hastened at the house of his father, and there, for a mountain, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had married his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winning grace that wins in front of and applause from the salon assemblies. There was none of this brilliant light that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a meloncholy charm about him which did not seem to arise the misfortune of the storm, but of a certain feeling inside, which appeared to indalo a conscious soul of the sheltering kingdom. His step was not so light, that he went astray where a butterfly or a color could attract – it was sedative and pensive. When Alono, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence, those sorrows which she knew destroyed this result, who would have exchanged a beer smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — this face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought by her guardians more fitting that his presentation should be delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, that he could be his professor. It was now resolved that the next salon, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the house of his father, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He did not feel interested in the frivolities of fashional slrangerf, when the bis spirit had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he torpedoed to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. Soori went into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced for a parlor.\nThe crowd was occessive — a bad only salon was held for a time of lang, and all the who were anxious to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account an 11 around him, engaged in that memory, the first time he had fenen Lord Ruthveri was in that same place — he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, so long as he was not aware of it.\nDead to his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing seeing a bit of spectrum would explode, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his notice to this place when he first entered society. He gagged until the bis limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of clami, and bewitching a passage through the crowd, he threw in his car, and was driven home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that he would burst out of his brairi. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in the dreadsul painting — the dagger — hif ooth .— He awakened him felt, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead resurrection again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his renf rested. It was impossible for him to be real — he made sure, for that, to go back to society; although he tried to ask for the cancer of Lord Ruthveri, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in galling up the information. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he removed the vision for a break, and there gave himself to his own eating thoughts. Finally, knowing that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, quadrified his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he sent away to move, turned around, they revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. And he sprang up, and took hold of his fist, and, with a rush, forced it toward the street; and at the door he found him blocked by a multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he did not care about Japan, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :«Remember your oath !”\nAubrey almost got distracted. Had the before mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was engrossed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister's attraction was now needed, and it was in vain that she intimidated him to explain to him what had caused his unruly conduct. He said a few words, and those who terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. He had to let this monster wander, carry a ruin on his breath, was he at heart, and that avoided his progress? His sister might have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and described his suspicions, who would believe him? He used his own hand to free the world from such a whirlwind; full death, he remembered, bad has already been wicked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw only one, and ate only when his soul sisler, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and she wanders, as often exposed in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer known to him; he returned home at first in the evening; but at last he lay down to rest wherever the fatigue looked at him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people who followed him; but they were so far away by him who fled faster than a fool. However, his conduct changed only at once. Astonished by the idea he left behind by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious to foresee, despite the oath, all those whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his shrewd and supple eyes were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, his sister was finally dazzled to beg him to refrain from sowing, for her, a faction that touched him so strongly. That in, however, resurranoe proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought appropriate to invert, and, fearing that his mind was alienating themselves, they learned that it was a high time to take back again this test which was before imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to get him drunk frowned on the sufferings he had daily encountered in his chopsticks, and to prevent him from exposing these rnarks of what they considered to be madness to the general eye, they engaged a physician to stay in the house, and to take care of him. He hardly seems to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible object. His incoherence finally became so great, that he was confined to his choice. He often lied there for the days, including being awake. He had become an emaoic, his eyes had reached a gimacious chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and remembrance reminiscing himself showed themselves to be selfish at the entrance of the bis sister; then he sometimes stifled himself, and, by grasping his heels, with the appearances of a gravely distressed that, would desire his riot of him with fists. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love is against me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her, the answer was :\"Truly! True !\" And again he sank into a slate, from where she couldn't even wake him up. This lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his incoherents became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the day he counted on his fingers, a difficult number, then smiled.\nThe time had rioarly passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his tutors entering his room, began to converse with his physiciari on the melancholic circumstances of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister would next mcly to marry. In contrast, Aubrey drew attention; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this grudge of intellect, of which he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count with whom he became involved in society, Aubrey contented himself, arid them even more by his expression of his intention to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but his sister was with him. He was apparently again the capablo of being affected by the influence of his beautiful sinile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He asked to speak with all his warmth gained, and to corigratulate it on his marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and every achievement; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on the chest back; opening well, which is really surprising to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait of iri, a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbaride, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at her with an expression frclntic os countenarice, he told her to swear that she would not negate this monster, because he — but he could not aduance — it seemed that tal voicegain sade Hjm remembers his oath — he suddenly turned around thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole, and thought it was only a retum of his disorder, entered, and forced him from Misf Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged them to delay, but for a day. They, adjusting this to the soundlessness they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, ended up pacifying him, and retired.\nLord Ruthuen called the morning after the living room, and he refused all the others. When he heard of the evil of Aubrey, he himself was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed in the midst of the water which he had gained. He hastened to the bosom of the former companion of his, found, by the constant presence, and the protagonist of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gra-\nThe Twice won Miss Bucky's ear. Who could resist his powerless tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of a bimmoine as an individual having no fympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with it for him to cling to himself ;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, except that he could listen to her soothing ;— in endo, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the elder branch fell to him for a long time, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's deranged slato ), which was to take place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and the guards of his, lingered to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, continuing, as if it were equaled to him his own happiness, honor, and honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held it in their arms as the hope of the Jr and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours the total marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest mo curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but, giving it to the physician, he thought that it was better not to harm Miss Auhreys spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without reply to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be more easily conceived, described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubroy grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the writing to finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually slole away away, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a wound, was out of the room of Tbe, and in a moment found a bim side in the apartment where everyone fell asleep early. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him into the room, speechless with fury. When Lord Ruthveri, in the stairs, wept in the ear :\"Render your oath, and if my fiancée is not my fiancée in the day by day, Yaur Sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to the servants who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer smear himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned in his sister, which is not the present that he entered, as the doctor was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, the bride and husband left Loridon.\nThe weakness of the allergy increased; the blood depression produced symptoms of the approach close to death. He disinterested his sister's guardians and, when midnight was beaten, it was written about what the reader had perpetuated: he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the lowest of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where his resting place was shone, and Providence his guide .\"\nOn board one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put on the Grccien Archipelago, on the island of the lhat, the Harbour of Mitylene. The beauty of this plain, and the certainty of always having cattle and vegetables there, led many British ships to visit the men of war and the merchants; and it was rather off the track for the ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums paid a great deal for the decision to a language. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were watered, and the handbag bathed for the cattle with the nativity, the ecclesiastical, and I took aramble to the cave called Homers School, engulfed by the herses, where we had been besieged. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain thus named) we met and engled a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left TB is 1 and 4 days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He set me up as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\" and he took me with him ;\"but I did not choose to tell Mltylene, where I am likely to marry .\" He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, knowing the river ,6 runs along to the bim, and he has 1st an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the merchant of wine, six hundred and two machines for her ,( about L 25 o curroncy English ), and has resided here for about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis has excited our euriosity very much, and we have not wasted the time to haveten at home where our country had resided. An old man kindly welcomed us, who led us into the mansion. It is composed of four separate rooms on the ground floor: a bathroom, a drawing room, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated in a sirnply way: walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center of the tob, and a small brieath flower, which could be made to play near the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Verius in a leaning possure; a sofa largo or sofa completed the furniture. In the hail stood a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book-ase: there were mirrors of rio, rior a point of slrigle. The bedroom had only a great maltress spread on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. Iri, the living room that we observed a marble break, once, the old man told us, full of books and papers, which were there in the chest of a large sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contents. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire, Shokspeare, Boleau, and the works of Rousseau eomplete; Volney's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the Germ ari language; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the game of Schillers thieves; the Paradise of Miltan Lost, the Italian odition ari, printed al Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greok press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were illuminated with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian arid Latin. The Mesfiah was literally serialized everywhere, and marked with strips of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books eternally before he eclipsed himself, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he surrenders; for he is so particular, that if I were moving a blow without order, he would frown upon me for a week of lodging; he is a very good stranger. I did him a favor once, and I did the product of the farm for the pain of taking care of it, except for the zechins of the twerity which I paid to an Armenian who is set in motion and is walking in a small chest in the woods, and which the Lord has dug here in Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was playing. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of canned marble with black lanterns and work orniches of frets (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were significantly higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a purr of coarse linen string. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks pass their evenings by smoking, drinking light wonos, such bones, \"lochryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left, we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lirnes gathered together on its borders, under the sbade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with a back of ornamental woodwork was placed, or we have worked at ld, the lord spent money from his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he was very polite, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be called a bird view. At 1 ino os rich rivers led the eye to Mount Caccia, covered with olive and myrtle tree in bloom, and on the summary of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic rot. A small storm from the ruins descended from the waterfalls of on the river, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. These smooth as glass, and the horizon is darkened by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and o a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were clearly reserved, spreading the light blue wave with spots of cmerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than Idid that; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who could reside in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Cand-\n\"The Armenian, saddened our conductor ,\" could say it, but I'm sure he won ,\" and can you tell an old friend ?\" he said ,\"If I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We don't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the bass, we took several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was 1st on the island, and had even danced with them at the normal feast. He saw a cow to a man, horses to the others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these arliclef. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor dogs. In short, it appeared to us, from everything we collect, as a very eccentric and caring character. Uncircumstances that we have learned, that our old friend at the score thought appropriate not to reveal. He had a very valiant daughter, with whom the tbelord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he could buy him a piano-fart, and taught him himself the music of it.\nSucb was the information we left on from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination all about the rack, guessing that this number in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the disposal, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our doubts disappeared. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pulpi 1 of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene .\" We had then heard about the fame of this Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe HaraIde\" being put in our hands, which recognized the recluse of Calcla on each page. Let us deeply regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comfort ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene the next day some; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, saying that it is not without interest, and in justice in the good name of his secretary, which has been grossly ruined. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with humble nature, or in any way contributing to soothing its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his leadership, seems to have their seat in his bosom. Tondity, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason for the marketing. It is a song on whose heart the Religion has put his bosom, and the over whose head Benevolerice has cast his coat. No Indian can read the previous pleasant \"trails\" without feeling proud of him or a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself must be horrified where all the most appear, only can censor the mistakes of a fellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in the dry, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the worst testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "2": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arbians, it seems common: however, it does not extend to the Greeks until the establishment of Christianity; and it has only ossumed its form presounded from the divisiori of the church Latin and Greek; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, shot a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it increased graduated, and formed the subjoct of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood, young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with the same variation of ligure, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and L0raine, which attenuated the helief castod, that the night vampyres lmbibe some of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, increased their strength, arid quickly died of consuinctions; that these human blood suckers fatten—and their lders dissolve to such a state of repletiori, as to cause blood to flow on all passages of their bodies, and even from the pores of the tiger.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious, and, of course, the credible reception of a particular case of vampyrjsm, which is declared a house, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, riarned Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cassvia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating some bones from the earth of the vampy grave, and ripping off his blood. But this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for twenty or thirty days after his death and death, many people complained of being tortured by him, and a deposilation was made, that four people had been deprived of life by high attacks. To prove even more evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as is assumed to be visual in cases of vampyrism) frosh, and completely free of corruption, and emitting to movth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the personalized remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is repainted for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. This was done, they took out. Osf his pearl, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these people who were badly provously dead of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe uriversal helief is that a person sucked by a vampy himself makes a vampy, and sucks in his stomach.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of observation, presounds than any other instance that is added to it. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crimo committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to confiscate his internal visits only to beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection.\nBut, as Vampyre sent him, your Corsica will be torn from the tomb of them; then, hunl the place of origin, and suck the blood of all your race; from there, from your daughter, sister, woman, around midnight drank the stream of lifo; yet hate the banquet that must feed by livid living Corsican, Your victims, are they exhale, Know the devil for their sire; As you cursed, Tbou cursed them, Your flowers are wjthered on the stem. Even onothal for your crime falls most, The youngest, the best loved of all, Sholl bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in the flaino! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the laslspark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand without stain will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a look when the tender offering of affection has been carried — but now is supported easily by your Memorial of your agony! But with the best drop of blood of himself, your grinning tooth, and the lip of the hook; then tracking your tomb of sulfur, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, till those in horror depart from the cursed dark spectrum than them.\nMr. Southcy hos also presented in his cool but beaupoem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the housekeeper Tbo Arabian Orieiza, who is represented as having turned sram the grave with the intention of tormenting bim that she liked better wbilst in existence. But this cannot be due to the sinfulness of her life, she is being paurtrated by the whole tale as a complete type of purity arid innocentness. The veracio nous Tournefort gives a long story in business voyages of several surprisingly easy vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of concdotes, and traditionalistic narratives jullustrative of his effects, put forth a few dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as Borbarian.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and that the medium is now corincid by merely pointing out that tub the term Vampyre is that in most genres, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of iri different parts of the world: like Vroueolocha, Vardoulaoha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parts of the two leaders, more resemblable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked around, if he could take part in the riots. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into those breaks where carelessness reigned. Those who sealed this feeling of awc could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, to a girice, to pierce the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on a cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, and these who had been acclaimed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their capclable presence of enclging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which never rolled a warmer hue, either of the puff of modostia, or of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours wore beautiful, many female bunkers swollen notorjety tried to win her attonations, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mocker of all monsters dressed in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountain bank, to attract her riot :— although in vairi :—where she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed upwards She, however, seemed not to have been perceived; even her unapplauseed impudence was flouted, and she left the field. But the adultery commune could not even influence the direction of its egg, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, he was apparently cautious with whom he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, still little knew that he was never speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a victorious language; and even if he was stifled by the dread of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his hatred appears from the vice, he was also often among those women who formed the van of their sex from their mestic virtuoso, asamong thossc who usually by the vices.\nConcerning the somo timo, a young gentleman named Avbrey arrived in London: he was an orphaned staff with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also himself by the guards, who, however, their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the greater burden of the Bi mind to the subalternal mercenary cleavages, he cultivated his immobilization more than his argument. He therefore had this romantic feeling of honour and candour, which definitely ruined so many apprentices of millers. He believed everything to sympathize with nature, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria only for the picturesque effect of the scene, if we see in the romances: he thought that the insemination of an oottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were so warm, hut that were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. Ho was beautiful, frank, rich: for these reasons, on his engagement in gay circles, many mothers encircling bim, sluving while should describe with the least truth, their lclrigidants or crawling favors: the daughters in the same as me, by their brilliant faces as he approaches, and by the sparkling eyes of bir, when he opens his lips, he soon led him into false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and wax candles that flickerod, nool of the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffsing, there was a real foundation in real life for one of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding a certain compensation is his gratified vanity, he was about to demand his dreams. What extraordinary is it being we are deseribed, crossed bim in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the impossibility to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, tacit thari lhe acquired in their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: to allow the imagination to imagine all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soori formed this object as hero of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the perfon in front of him. He met HLM, paid attention to him, and so far advanced to his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens fairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to fly away. Desiring to obtain information about this slngular character, who, until now, had only bis curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which, for many generations, thought necessary to entangle young people to take a few quick steps in the caroeur of the vice towards putting themselves on an equal with the elderly, and not lowering them to appear as if flalleri from heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of plea or praise, reconciling to the degree of competence they are to be carried. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal from the jojn. Flattened by such a mark of estecmus of him, who apparently did not have in common with the men of the other, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circular water.\nHilherto, Avbrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lard Ruthven, and now he found that, although many of his actions have been exposed from the basic point of view, the results have been subjected to different conclusions based on the apparent motives of his conduct. His appearance was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle vagabond, and the beggar, received from his more hand that has enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not abort to notice that he was born on the vltuous, driven to indignation by the misfortunes Even waiting up the virtue, which he gave his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes with barely removed; but when the profligal camo for back something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wallow in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. It was, however, attributed by him to the greatest imporlunity of the vicious, who generally foresee the retirement of the virtuous evil. There, a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, who was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curvature on it, because they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brusfels arid other cities that lhey passed, Auhrey was surprised at the apparent oagerness with which his companion sought for the centers of all life in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always played successfully, except where the known gullion was his antagonist, and then he lasted even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, for when he met a young novioc, or the father without chance of a family number0us; then his very desire seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction of mental appearance was laid clslde, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of tho cal while dallyling with the bat mouse. In each city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness of a dongean, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat fraritic, in the midst of the spreading airs of hungry children, without one end of his immense lack of wealth, whether to buy even suffloi to their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the game tablc; but immediately lost, at the ruinous of many, the last gun der that he had just removed from the convulsive take of the innocent: this might but being the result of a certain degree of bone knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the most experienced continuing bone. Auhrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this chastisement and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to show him frankly and openly; however, it never worked. Lord Rutbven in hif carrioge, and in the midst of the wild-and varjus rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke of the loss as his lip; and although Aubrey was the object of bis frillosity, he did not obtain a gratjfication gratjficious of her that the constant excitation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which to his imagination b egan lo save the appearance of something superematral.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey spent time losing sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room in the morning circle of an Italian count, while he went in search of the inemorials of the almost deserted back town. While he was engaged, letters adorned the fried England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing from the affection of the huts; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had been besieged that there was an evil power residing in his companion, this seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards immediately insisted on his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, because the possessor of irresistible power of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulterer had not arisen in the hatred of the horrorcharacter; but he had asked, in order to strengthen his satisfaction, that his victim, the partner of the culprit bis, should be precipitated from the pinnacle of the unsouled virtue, to the lowest abyss infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those females that he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and evil did not scruple to expose all the defect of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single point of brick that on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to annoy him completely, to seek, in the sense, to watch him swear closely, and not to let him pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, as his Lordship was erideovouring to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he mainly friquered. In Italy, it is rare for an unmingled woman to be met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of the innocent, although killing a daughter. Losing not the time, he elevates Lord Ruthvens an apartment, and asks him abruptly for his intentions towards the lody, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that same night. Lord Ruthuen replied that the intentions of this were such that he pleased all the house on such an opportunity; and being in a hurry, whatever he intended to marry him, me only laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this moment, must refuse to accept his Lordfhip in the proposed their remalnder, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and calling upon the lady's mother, informed him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The Ofsignatian has been proven. The next day, Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his camplet of agreement to a separation; but did not mention any suspicion of his first year having been thwarted by the interpasitian of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his steps to Greece, and crossed Penirisula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his house of residence of a Greek; and soon occupied biinself by tracing the records faded from monuments upon ancient glory, which apparently, shame of chronicling the relations of free only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichen. Under the same machinery as he, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a printer wanting to pour on canvases the hopeo promised by the faithful into the paradise of Mohammed, savo that her eyes spoke too much of spirit so that someone thought that she might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plairi, or stumbled along the side of Movntan tube, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who would have expended her eye, apparently the eye of the unimade nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the adapted Arimal but the taste of an epic. The ancient light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the careless girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, what forgot the lecherins he had just deciphered on a nearly erased tablet, in the contemplation of his sylph-1ike figure. Ofton wanted her braids to fall, while she flattered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the shades, he might well excuse the oblivion of the anliquary, but letting escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. Why describe charms that one feels, but that the line can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, indulgence, indulgence, lack of overcrowded rooins and stifling bullets. While HC drew the remains which he used to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of his penoil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the dance circling on the open plairi, would paired, to him in all the dazzling aloeurs of youthful memory, the pomp of marriage that she encompassed in her youth; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a sense of cleoler on her mind, told him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His fortune and his apparent belief of what she irritated, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the dearest, forced each year, by nourishing the life of a woman in love to prolong her existence during the learned months, her blood would run cold, that he would be tempted to laugh at her from so many idle and miserable santases; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old reindeer, who had at last detected one living among the lhemselves, after several of her parents and children had been found to be badly marked by the buffer of the friend's appetite; and when she found him so impulsive, she begged him to believe her, far it had been noticed that those who had dared to seek their exifterice, always hold so much proof given, which forced them, the grief of mind and heart broken, to the truth. She broke away from bim the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror grew, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, to be always persuasive in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Rutbvens superritarian power.\nAubrey asked to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted by all the infected virtues of the used meaning that he had sought for his vision of romance, gained the heart bis; arid whoe he ridiculed the idea of a young renan of the Eriglâtre habits, marrying a Greek girl uneducated, still more and more attached to the almost Sairie from the before. He sometimes rips off from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian reef, he goes away, determined not to return to his object was reached; but to always find impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he removed an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his sincells. The native was unconscious of the love of this, and was still the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always used to split up from a bim with reluctancc; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could vis-à-vis her favorite habits, while her guardian was taken up in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that her cat escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, played with horror in the name itself. Soon a sister, Aubrey decided to proceed to one of his oxen, who had to hold him for a few hours; when they harded the noun of the place, they all at once begged him not to come back at night, as he should not go through a wood, where no Greek could ever, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the employees jri their nocturnal orgies, and announced the most ugly evils as imminent on him that decided to cross their palh. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey put Oss unattended on his excurfion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his pupils, mocking the belief of these horrible friends, had inspired them to such a terror. As he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to resign himself, and he allowed the power of these beings to be put into action. However, he was so busy with his research, that we did not see that doyling was about to end, and that on the horizon there was only one spot which, in the warmest climates, so fastly assembled in a hectic mass, and poured all their circle over the devoured land .— He was however the last, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immoderately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echo thundering bad barely a resting irriterval — his heavy thick rairi forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, when 1st the blue lightning worked seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse took the frigate, and they carried it with a terrible speed in the entangled forest. The animal finally, through the fat...\niguc, stoppode, and he found, by being dazzling from lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose up from the mafes of dead water and brushwood surrounding him. Demonstrating, he objected, jumped to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trusling to get a shelter from the plotting of the form. As he approached, the thunders, in a silent word, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, contaminating in one almost without a flash of sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by a tbunder who rolled again on his head, he, with a hard effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself tried himself from the absolute darkness: the smile, however, the judge. He was apparently imperious; although he had scattered, the aurids continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He found him in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a police cried out :\" Always mocked !\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh, and that he himself was struck by a force which he seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his most expensive lily that he could, wrestled; hut in vain: he was lifted from his feet and thrown by the enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw him on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his hands on his throat — when lho dazzled many torohes penetrating into the hole of TB, which in the light of the day, disturbed him ;— he stood up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the stake of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The story was now silent; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their fell torches on the mud walls, and the ladod stubble on the individual straw every with heavy soot flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey, she was sought who had attracted him to his cries; he was forgotten in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once more burst upon him, to pierce the airy form of his righteous drivers burned in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision coming from imaginatively disturbed hjs; but agairi saw the same form, that he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no color on his cheek, not even on the ber lip; but the lhore was a silence on his thal face seemed almost as attached as life there was once :— on his rick and chest was blood, and on his throat were the rnarks of the teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A year soon arose, and Aubrey was laid next to his wife had recently been for him, the object of so many bright and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held most of his hand, a bare dagger of a pa ricular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parties who had been questioned in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable critics, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" To describe their grief would be impossible; but that they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chore. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAbbrecy being put at bed was seized of a very violent fever, and was often delirious; at the same intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by an incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated my dictions upon his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chance at this time to arrive in Athens, and, of some motivation, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant atladen. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, hc was horrified and amazed at the sight of him whose image he had riow combined with this of o Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost involving repentance for that the fault caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care that he slipped, soon reconoiled him to the presence bis. His sentence seems completely changed; he no longer takes possession of the apathetic being who was so astonished by Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the old, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his fixedly raised circle, with a malicious exullation smile playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the latent stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently looking at the waves of tides raised by the cooling breeze, or marking the progress of these orbs, turning like our world, still sun ;— in fact, he clinged to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weakened much, and this elasticity of the mind which had once so distinguished it now seemed to have flod for ovor. Today he was as fond of solitude and solitude as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, the bis spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; he sought him in the midst of the ruins he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he were to sweep her in the woods, his slight step might seem wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly lunning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded lhroat flaw, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, each characteristic of which created suchbitler associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the care to steer whom he had taken from him during his illness, that he should visit the parts of Greece neither hold yet seen. They moved in a very firm direction, and moved to every place where a memory could be attached; but they hadtened from one place to another, but they did not begin to listen to what they were looking at. They heard a lot of people, but they gradually began to look at these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result, neglecting the counsel of the inbebitants, they once had only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a dosenco. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with the masses of large rock descended from the blackbo-\nDuring the rushes, they have bad reasons to fall back on their negligence; because they barely went to the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were wired by the whistle of bullets, it is at their head, and by the soothing ratio of several cannons. In an instant, the guards had left them, and, placing themselves rocks, had begun to pull in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven on Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turri sheltering defilement: bvt shame to be so hated by an enemy, who with insults to make them move forward, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should climb above and take them back, they decided to one to rush in search of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven took a bullet back into his shoulder, which dug it down. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the contest or his own peril, he was surprised to see the faces of robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rulhvens wounded, immediately cast their arms and shaken.\nBy the promos of great reward, Aubrey soon encouraged him to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and having agreed on a ransom, which was no longer distracted by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their compass came back with the promised sum, for which he had the order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days the moralization followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as careless of the pain as he had no bad beakers of the objects that surrounded him; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with more than usual –\" Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I have taken into account the death of my life as quiet as the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey replied. \" I need, but a few things — my reading collapses — I can go to the end — but if you comfort me all those who know me, my honor was free to die in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Jurez !\" cried the dying man, raising himself in the midst of a view...\nSince ,\"Swear by all your saviors, by all your fears of nature, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any life moaning in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was flowing over his pillow, and a bathtub more.\nAubrey withdrew from rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his aquaintance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shivorling came over, as if it came from the presence of something horrible waiting for a bim. From the beginning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he did not have the body, when a thief had methim, and brought him in, he was a na langer, having been transported by him and the cainrads, at his retreat, at his top of a nearby mountain, according to the promise that they had given his seigneury wrong, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his teeth. Aubrey was surprised, and hit several of the men, decided to bury him in the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of either body or clothes, the thieves swore that they were reporting the same rock on which they had stretched the body. For some time, his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he finally stood back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the store of clothes.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appeared conspired for heating that superstitious melanchically had grasped his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there has been one case of complicity of several groups of offers, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While returning, arid looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the samo style as the dagger discovered in the falale hut—he trembled—hasteri to get other evidence, to be found a weapon, and the horror can be imagined when being defamed that he would, although strangely in shape, equal the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need them, they seemed to be linked to the dagger, but he still did not want to believe; but the particular farm, the same varied shades on the shaft and sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room ser doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to remove Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents are in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. Aubroy's beoamo spirit almost broke under so many abrogated horrors; he feared that his lady had made a victim to the English destroyer. He became a morgue and silent; and his only occupation was to insist on the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swirled to the English shores; and he hastened to the home of his fathers, and the threshing, for a land, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, a memory of the past tho. If before, by her infantile carosses, she had won her affection, now that the woman did not seem to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had no grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There is none of this light shine that exists only in the cured atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the quality of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not seem to pose from unlucky, but some feeling wildbin, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not so light, which misleads a butterfly or a clever mcly attack – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was never lightened by the smile of July; bul when his brother breathed to his hls afsection, and got into his pre --\nIf you forget these deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have excavated her smile for the vocabulary that? He shook as if those eyes ,— that space then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eight years old.\nIn, and had not been introduced to your world, it was thought by its guardians more appropriate that its presentation should be delayed both until the return of his brother from the continent, when which could be his protector. So it was now resolved that next to show, which was the quick approval, should be the time of its entry into the \"bvsy scene .\" Aubrey would have preferred to remarry in the mansion of the father's body, and fed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not be interested in the srivolities of the most fashionable, when his mind had been torn apart by the uniforms he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his pride to the protection of his sister. They soon entered town, and prepared for the next day, which had been set in motion like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and it was anxious.\nYou get used to the smile of royalty, you are quick to have fun. Aubrey was there with his sister. While he was stoned in an owner by himself, devoid of everything around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place — he suddenly felt secluded by the arm, and a voice who recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly the courage of time, pretending to see a spectrum that would be the last bim, when he perceives, at a little distance, the same figure who had clarted his opinion on this place on his first entry into society. He looked until his members refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take a friend's weapon, and force a passage through the crowd, threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and fastened his hands up his head, as if he were afrising his thoughts burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthvon again in front of him – oircumstrives began in the awful picture – the dagger – his oath. – He woke up, he could not believe that this was possible – the dead are resurrected again! e :– He thought his imaginative idol had wronged the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, about him, to return to the company into; so although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining information. He began to sew nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a corner, and there he gave himself his own devastating thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awakened, and eroding another room, fed his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he had scratched to motion, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he had the most horror. He pushed her to the door, he found himself impoded by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords, and while he was committed to passing them, he again heard that the way murmured near him –\"Remember your oath !\" – He did not dare to dye, but, pressed his sister, he quickly returned home.\nAubrey became a distracted almost. So if his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now the certainty of the monster's living has pressed again on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed him to explain to him what caused her abrupt conduct. He did only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath invaded him, and, in the midst of all that he cherished, he removed this monster so that he might roam, bearing driving over his breath, and not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would relieve him? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he was born again, had already been murdered. For days, he remarried in this state, rose up in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes floating in tears, begged him, his sake, to support the picture. Finally, no longer people calm and loneliness, lest his pride, wander from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he deflated, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humid indnight. He was not longer to be recognised; at the first check return with the evening at home; but to also be lying down him to rest where fatigue took more on him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but he was distracted by him who ran away from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence, he left his brothers' world, with a friend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he decided to enlist again in society, and looked at him closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all those whom Lord Rutbven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and hagnar eyes were intriguing, shivering hif iriward so visible, that his sister would finally have to beg for him to refrain from fairing, for the love of beer, society cl which affects so strongly cdhim. When, blindly, the relationship proved to be urialistic, the guards thought it was good to intervene, and, pretending that his mind became alienated, they thought it was high to take up this trust which had been upofed upan lhem before by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible one subject. His inconsistency became so great last time, that he was confined to his cottage. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a giassy letter ;— the only remaining sign of affection and remembrance manifested himself at the entrance of his sister; then he sometimes began, long, to grasp his hands, with grips that afflicted him in a severe way, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim – if your voice for me is a boon, don't come near him !\" When, at the time, she asked whom he was speaking to her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" and again being sunk into a state, from which the same case could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: little by little, commenter, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and if the mind threw a porlion of its morosity, while its guardians observed that once in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smile.\nThe time had not passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to converse with his physiciari about the melancholic circumstances of Aubreys incursion in such a terrible crisis, when his sister went the next day to get married. Instantly, Aubrey attitude was attracted; he asked the anxiously whom. Happy with this brand of relumining jritollect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they incited the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking this was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed pleaded, and astonished even more by his expression of his intellect to be present to the nuptials, and decisiring to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes the sister was with him. Hc was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his beautiful family; for he pressed her to her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the lhaught to brother to be onco moro living at the expense of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth and congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his rank and all his achievements; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his hail; the experimenting one, what was his surprise at seeing the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait of a plain poroxysm of ragc, and set it on foot. On his asking seemed to him not to understand why he thus distracted the resemblance of his future Husbaride, so he looked as if he did not understand — then by grabbing her hands, arid looking at his mind a frantic expression of face, swearing that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not cling—yet seemed as if this voice again asking him to remember his oath—he suddenly turned, linking Lord Ruthveri was near bim butsaw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a turning point in her disorder, entered, and saw Miss Aubrey, overturning her to leave him. He fell his knees up, implored them, begged them to delay them, but one day. They attached this to the holiness they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvcri had called in the morning after the living room, and 6 th had refused with the hurry another. When he took care of Aubreys evil, he readily understood to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered an Irisane, his exultation and his pleasure could be blindly concealed from this making that he had obtained this information. He settled at the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and by the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he began to listen to Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Has Tangue had dangers and tasks to tell — could speak of himself as an individual who has no sympathy for any overcrowded being of the earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself ;— could say how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem dreadful of preservation, if he was married that he could listen to his foot accents ;— in sinus, he knew well how to use the art of Theserpent, or such will the will of destiny, that he won his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained an important einbassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in the shape of his brother's disturbed state ,) which was also taken place the same day he had already had his dowry for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a paper arid with feathers; it was the given; he put a letter to his sister, wounding her, as she enjoyed her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who held him in their arms as a hope to bet and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours the total marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sorcerers promised that they would delvorer him; but by giving him to the physicist, he would do better not to harass Miss Auhreys mind any more by, what he would coriside, rauings of a maniac. The night passed on the spiritual roots to the occupied inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the notes of the occupied preparation. Morriant came, and the sound of the cards broke on his ear. The Aubrey grew up almost francial. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, they gradually stole the aisle, leaving it in the gulf of an old woman without vergogne. He seizes the opportunity, with a waf bourid out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: which imprenedialy oppressed, and, taking his arm by force, the shake of the room, furious speechless. Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear ,\" Remember your arid, know, if my fiancée does not want to do, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" Thus, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to search for him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had no end at the moment, had broken a vase of blood, it was agreed to hold. It was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he eluded, the politician was afraid to shake it. The wedding was salemarked, and the bride and the brideroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; bloodshed has led to the symptoms of near-death approaches. He wanted his sister's Canadians to be shaken, and when midnight had passed, he camouflagedly recounted what the throclder struck, and immediately died.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven made his appearance, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the hair of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nREPORT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRONICS.\n\"The world has six years before the bill, where to choose its rest tray, arid Providence guide .\"\nIN Sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put into the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi with cattle and vegetables always to be bad lhero, lead many British ships to visit it — both men of war and men of research; and it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the gap or a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay of Tbe, men were piled up to water them, and the stock exchange man was negotiating with the chemists with the catho, and the clergy and I were taking a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and in other places, where we had been in favor. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and hired a young Greek like our goal, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho engaged me as a pilot,\" soldered the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a strange man, a very good man. Tbe cottage over the hill, facing the river, belongs to hiin, and he is afraid that an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six zechins grouped for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there from 6 to fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the various islands .\"\nThis habit has aroused our curiosity a lot, and we have not wasted any time hastening into the house where our compatriot had resided. We were received by an old man, who led us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with an anoxed spacious closet. They were all simply decorated: greeri walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be made to play through branches by pressing a spring field in the bone side, a srall brane Verivs iri a leendiring picture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a half-carie English dazen chairs, and a book empty-facility: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The chambranle had only one large mattress lying on the float, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the common mat throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed corners, once, the handle man told us, filled with books and papers, which were taken in the chest of a great feman in the class: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to exclude the contents. On the establishment of the rees were Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roufseau Warks compiete; Volley's Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German tbe; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzobues novels; Schiller's play of the Rabbirs; Milton Paradisc Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in Isolo; several small pamphlets of Greek tho prefs at Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, arid marked with paper sips, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had been lurring these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with the other; but, he said, they must lie here until his return; for it is so special that if I move something with orders of soul, who would frown me for a week together; it is indeed very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of the farm for the evil of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small contract in the world, which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the horse externally bad pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen braad, on the canned pillars m arble with plinths black and corriches of work of frets ,( as it is now custamary in Greek architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof of tobe. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was wrapped by a fine tile of Turkey, beneath an awning of coarse strong linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings, iri smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying ying lunch evening breeze.\nFor fear that we would enter the house, a small stream would go away, grapes, oranges and lindens would gather together on its borders, and under the shape of bones two large bushes of spelling were placed in a seat of marhle, an ornamental wooden back, on the dock, we are told that the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church for a week, except on Sundays .\"\nThe view of this siege was the whale perhaps called \" a bird-eyo view. \"A linen of rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in the blouse, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the mosaic area. A small stream from the ruins descended into a broken waterfall, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a l just on the 1 o, near a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several walnuts were distinguished, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Domnolok, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"may hang on, but I am furious he will not do it ,\"and a carinot tell you, an old friend ?\" said I ,\"if I can\" said hc ,\" I dare not. We did not bother visiting the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was the last island of Tbe, and even danced with them at the Tbe nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also gags a new hoof for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gives Greek tests to the poor children. In short, he seems...\nTo us, of all that we have called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage bought a clean note to reveal. He had a better daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-sort, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing that this crawling to Groece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a disposition philosophy, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"on what you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited them in Mililene .\" We misheard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcl on each page. Did we not regret not being more curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Milylone on the same future day; but to me that day will never come back. I render this state of mind, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of my Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described as an insensitive disposition, averse to associate with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be plairily collected from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly doped in his seniory poems, seem to have their soul in his bosom. Sensitivity system...\npathetic, and charity seems to guide his actions: and this courting the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as on whose heart Religion has put his seal, and on whose head Benevolence cast her coat. No man can read the \"traits\" of pleadings until he is proud of himself as a peasant. As far as his love or love is concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify them before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confreremortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and when the applause of the world, is the secret testimony of a viruous heart and a conscience of approval self-approving.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "3": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstilion on which this story is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it does not extend, however, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the duezion of the Latin and Greek church; at times, the lead being predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the rising dead of their grass, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, to Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where there was beef, thal vampyres rightly imbibed some parts of the blood of their victims, who had emancipated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these blood-sucking humans were fattening-\nand their veins have become distended to such a state of repulsion, in order to shed the blood of all the passages of their bodies, and even pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a church account, and, of course, credibility of a particular case of vampyrism, whooh is said to have accused Madreyga, in the Hungory. It seems that, in an examination after the commander-in-Chef of the arid magistrates of the square, they positively and unanimously affirmed that, about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been attached to say, that in Cassouia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of evil, removing part of the earth from the tomb of the vampire, and rubbing himself with his blood. This preclusion, however, did not prevent him from being a victim of vomiting himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death, many people complained that they had been victims of burial and demovement, four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, to take the body, and found it (as is supposed to usuol in cases of vampyrism) fresb, arid completely free from corruption, and to throw himself into the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and slorid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was thrown on Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have been as dreadful as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and shut his body, and cast the ashes into his rubble. The same measures were adopted with the course of people who had already died of vampyrism, if they were, in their turn, to become agents on others who were monitoring them.\nThe universal belief that a person sucked by a vampyre gets sucked by a vampyre and sucks in turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of the current observations than any other forum that might be presented. The parts of Iri cannot like Greece, it is considered a sart of punjshmerit after death, for a heinous crime committed while it was in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit the bi-infernal visits only to those he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes to \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the dry land, like Vampyrene, thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and Tben shall haunt the place of origin, and shall suck the six moons of all thy seed: from thence of the daughter, sister, wife, unto the night drain of the life of the stream; and yet hate the banquet of Tbe, which persecutes Musl, shall feed thy living corse, thy victims, and shall perish, and know the devil for their tears: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best wretched of all, will bless you with the name of a sadric — This word will engulf your heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy gianc must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, the tear of the hand, the braids of his yellow hair, of the whip, in life a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn — But now is born by the memorial of your agony! But with the best blood himself will flow; thy grinchy tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at the svllen bove, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Soutboy also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire curse of the Arab rnaid Oneiza, who is repeseritedas having returned from the grave for the purpose of the tormener, she loved better what is in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have had as a result of the sinvlness of her life, she cing poured into the whole of the tale of a complete type of purity and innocence. The Veraciovs Tournefort makes a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for what he claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrated by his efforts, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classical error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the links of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and the which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that if the term Vampyre is the one in general accepted, there are several other fynonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucolaka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared at the various fairs of the chiefs of the town, more noticed for his singularities than for his rank. He looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the father has attracted his attention, which he could by cl look calmly he, and throw away the fear of those breasls who here the carelessness reigned. Those who fell this sense of fear, could not explain from where it arose: somc attributed it to the dead grcy eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and to a glanc to penetrate through the inw ard the functioning of the heart; but fell the cheek with a radius of charge that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, arid those who were busy with old excitement, and now fell the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in the presence of the hearty hair to engage their attention. Despite the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer hue, even lher of the modesty blush os, or of the strong emoliori tob of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain his attention, and to win, at least, some what marks that they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of each insect. She threw herself in her way, and she put everything on the robe of a mountain bank, to draw her attention :— Though in April :— when she stood before him, even if her eyes were apparently fixed on her, if it seemed that they were not perceived ;— even her insurmountable impudence was bofflod, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not female that the sex was indifferent to him: however, so few knew that he was addressing himself to women. He had the reputation of winning the torigue; and even if it was beyond the fear of his singular character, or they were moved by his hatred of the vice, he was also often among the women who cultivated the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young gentleman named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was a left orphan with only one sister in the possession of great us alth, their parents who died while he was still in childhood. Bequeathed also to himself by guardians, who said it their duty simply to take care of his fate, while they relquied the most important charge of his mind to the care of the necessary scandals, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this romantic high feeling of honor on the candor, which every day destroys so many apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and said that voice was lhrown iri by Providence meroly to serve the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that misery of a cottage mcrely consisted on the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but that were adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. At the end of the day, poets' dreams were the realities of the past. He was beautiful, frank, rich: for these reasons, when he entered the Gay Circle, many mothers surrounded him, trying to which should describe the least truth that this languishing ar farce favorite: the girls at the same time, by their sparkling contents when he approached, and by sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he soon led him to nolions of his talents and merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was starred by the finding, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that flashed, riot swept away the presence of a ghost, but for lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these assemblies of pictures and pleasant descriptors contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. By finding, however, compensation in his gratified country, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above crossed his career.\nHe dumped him; and the unsuspecting theory of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other figs of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to the existence of duothoir, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing the imagination to spice up anything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, which soan formed this object in the hero of a novel, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than Persian before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and he made a lot of advance on his record, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were harassed, and soon sounded, from the notes of the preparation in — Sleet, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had only written his civriosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to perforate on the tour, that it was considered necessary for many generations to allow young people to take a few quick stops in the service to capture an equivalence with age, and not to allow them to appear as falling from the sky, whenever social intrigues are lied as subjects of pleasantness or praise, having the degree of competence to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mended his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such an system mark of HLM, which apparently did not have in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to ridicule Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he has Fourid, that, although much more of his attention has been exposed to his point of view, the results strengthen the different confluences of the motives apparent in his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his group more than in enough to relieve their immeasurable desires. But Aubrey did not refrain from pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he had given his alarms ;— these were sent from the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve bis will, but to allow him to wall in his lust, or t flow even deeper in his linquity, he was sent with much wealth. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was no circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still unorthodox impressed on his mind: also those on whom he was bcstowed, unshakeably his that there was o cursc on jl, because they were either led to tbescafffold, or sunk to the lowest splint the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the shadows through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent cagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the fashivable vices; there he entered the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, always attached with success, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he was even more so than he won it; bvt it was always with the same unshakeable face, while he generally looked at the around society: he did not, however, have his when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent strenuousness of the mind was set aside, arid his eyes sparked with more fire than that of the cat who deliated with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn the circle of srom that he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this proud; while many a father was sitting frantic, in the midst of talking about silent hungry children, without only one far from his immense end wealth, where with Huy even enough satisfying their present carving. However, he did not take money from the gclinbling table; but immediately lost, to many, the last gilder that he had just sriatchered from the candulsive take of the innocent: this might but was the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to take the curing of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begs him to castigate this charm and plea that proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own project ;— but he delayed it — for the same day, he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his cye spoke less than his lip; and though Au Harry was near the object of his frillosity, he did not obtain more gratification of her than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exalted irnagination began to assume the apprehension of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he allowed him to attend the morning circle of an Italian country every day, as he went in search of the memorials of another almost decomposed city. Whether he was so engaged, letters arrived from England, which he opened with the impatience ager; the first was from his sister, blowing nothing from the affection bvt; the other was from his guardians, the bim latler astoried; if he had previously entered the imagination bis lhal tbere wclsan ill being able to reside in his companion, these seem to give him a sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his moro awkward habits dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had no origin in the hatred of his character; but that he had reciprocated, improved the hif gratification, that his victim, the partner of his vilt, had to be cast from the plnnacle of virtue vullied, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degrease: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on account of their virtue, had, from his departure, even thrown the thick mask aside, and had not scrupulously to oppose the quie deformity of their vices in the public eye.\nAubrey determined that by leaving one, the character of the pipe had not yet shown a single on a breakpoint that rests on the eye. He resalved to invent a plausible project for the abandonment of jng hjin a 1 together, purposing, in the mean, during, of the way more closely, and to allow no slight circumstance to pass through non-dyed. He clasps himself in the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship strives to work in the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose house he has mainly fermented. In Italy, it is rarely that an irritated female mingles with society; therefore be obliged to wear his plaris in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all the windings of this, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though thought daughter. Having lost no time, he inherited Lord Ruthuen's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his with intentions to respect the Iady, informing him to the same lime that he was aware of his being about to meet her that same laugh. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that everyone would have had such an opportunity; and when asked if he had enlisted to marry, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired;\nTo say that from the moment of the battle, it is necessary to refuse to accompany his hip girl lords the rest of their visit, he ordered his servant to show other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informed the book of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The assignment was made. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not insinuate any suspicion of his plans unleashed by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey made his way to Greece, and passed through the Peninsula, soon to Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself by tracing the erased records of the ancient glory on monuments which, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many lichen oloured. Under the roof like himself, there existed a 6th, so beautiful and delicate, that she night had formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on the carivass the promised hope of failure in Mabometfa paradise, except that tall her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she might belong to those who had no souls. In dancing on the plain, or in tripping on the side of the innount, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a poor type of her beauties; for those who would have exchanted her.\nthe eye, the eye of an animated nature, for this luxurious and sleepy look of animals, but for the taste of an epic. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquiljes, and often would be the incorruptible girl, engaged in the pursvit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, to the ardour of him, who forgot the letter that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tab, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, if her braids fall, while she flitted around, expose in the ray of the sun such deliciously bright and rapidly discoloring shades, he might well excuse the oblivion of antiquarian trees, which let escape from the spirit of this very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passion in Pausariias. But why not describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without letting themselves be knocked down by crowded drawer pieces and still balls. As he drew these remairis which he used to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she then described her circular dance on the open plain, painted, at home in all the brilliant colors of young memory, the wedding porn that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning to the subjects that hod obviously made a greater impression in her mind, would tell bim all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her kindness and apparent belief in what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years among her friends, and the dear bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful funeral to prolong her life for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he was trying to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe attached to her the names of old men, who had finally chosen one living among them, after many of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the friend's appetite; and she found him so unrepentant, she begged him to believe, for it had been, rernarked, that those who had dared to question the existence, had always had a given proof, which forced them, with grief and tear, to confess that it was true. She disdained him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror was increased, with a rather accruing description of Lord Ruthven; however, he continued to persuade, that there could not be the truth in the fears of beer, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that all lent to the excited belief in the supernotative power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling to Ianthe, his innocence, thus contrasting with all the affected virtues of the women whom he had sought for his vision of love, wrote his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hats, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself even more and more attached to the almost magical form before bim. He would tear himself from her, and, forming the plan of the call if there were Ariquiquarian research, he would go away, determined not to return until his object was maintained; but he always found it impossible to focus his attention on the theruins around him, while in his mind, he kept an image that sounded alone the rightful possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was a uriconscient of his love, and has always been the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed to leave him with relucency; but it was because she did not have any more with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy in the skelcbing or uncavering somo fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, said they both, with several present, affirmed the existence of dujr, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, because he had to necessarily pass the wood of througha, where no Greok would ever remain, after the closing of the day, until any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the filthiest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made of their representations, and tried to laugh the thing of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so as to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey ended his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obsess the melancholy force of his host, and was concerned that his words, flouting the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When it was the absolute of the doctor, Iarithe came beside horses, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into the office ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not see that the daylight was about to collapse, and that on the horizon there was one of the stocks' thoscs who, iri, the warmer climates, gathered so quickly in a huge mass, and poured out all their rage on the devoted country .— He, however, finally mounted his horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these climates of soul, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the neighborhood begins: and it had already advanced far, the power of the above of the storm — its thunders failing had barely a resting interval — its thick and heavy rain forced others through the foliage of the cover, while the blue lightning of the fork seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse got scared, and it was carried with a terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found, by the light of the lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a canelet barely lifted if it came out of the masses of dead moats and a brush that surrounded it. Demontriring, he approached, hoping to fry one for the guide to the city, or at least relying on the obtairi shelter of the pelting of the slorm. As he approached, the thunders, silent sor o mummerit, allowed HLM to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with mockery, with the exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was starred; but, excited by the thunder that snuck on his heel, he forced, with a sudden effort, the opening of the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not peried; sorry, although he called, the sounds continued, no remark was confused with him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; when a voice shouted ,\"Always floundered !\" He felt harassed by the one whose strength seemed superhuinari: determined to sell life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground tossed :— the enemy watered upon him, and kneeled in his chest, had placed his hands upon bis that light in the day, disturbed him ;— he immediately rosc, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the bracbes, as he brokoed through the wood, was rio longer beard. The storm was riow still; arid Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the lhatch placed on any individual straw with soft flakes. In the desire of Aubrey, they sought her who had drawn him up with her cries; he was again left in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torch burst again upon him, to perpetrate the aerial furnace of her beautiful eonducator brought into the course without a spot. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was a vision that emerged from his dislocated imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, tense by his side. There was a color near his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face which seemed almost as endearing as the life that the death alone there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vaccine :— to this man painted, weeping, simultaneously passed by horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A otter quickly formed, and Aubrey was a lloid beside her who had already been the object of so many brilliant and magical vibes for him, now fallen with the flaw of life that had died in her. He did not know what the gypsies were — his mind was tainted and seemed to escape reflection, and to take a run in the vacanie — he said almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular coristruction, which had been found in the hut. They were quick to say a word about the evenings of essays that got into the ark of her that a mother missed badly. Their lamentable cry, as they approached the city, warned of a terrible disaster. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were insolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being pulled to the body was seized of a very violent fever, and was often delusional; iri these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthuen and Ianthe — by an incalculable combination, he seemed to be begging his old currency to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, had the chance at this moment to arrive in Athens, and, of any matter whatsoever, at the hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed hirinsels in the same house, and became his constant ottendari. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whom he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rutbven, by his kirid words, insinuating the greatest repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and slill rnore by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to the presence of the half. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astute Aubrey; but also soori that bis convalescence began to be fast, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubreyperceived no difference from the former man, except sometimes that he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted hiin. With regard to the last stage of the Inualid, LordRuthveri was apparently committed to observing the tidal blue waves raised by the cool breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the motionless sun ;—irid, which seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe kind of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, and that the elasticity of the mind which once had its distinguished now seems to have failed forever. He was now as in love with madness and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wished, his thought could not find it in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought it in the midst of the rubbish which he had frangled before, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side—if he held it in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the midst of him, in the quest for the modest purple; then turning, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a black smile on his lips. He determined the scenes of the fly, which each proueuro created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during the bisil Incss, that they should visit the thoso parts of Greee and had not yet seen. They travel in all directions, and look for every place to which a memory could be attached: blue. Although he hastened to go from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what he was looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these rare ports, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, which they incentred, it was to expel the generosity of those that they defended prelude dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they traveled with only a few guards, more of your service as gives their defense. On entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the bone which was taking a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had reasons to repaint their negligence; well fcarcely were the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were killed by the whistling of stakes near the head, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing them behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthuon and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a manna behind the bend sheltered from defilement: but hard to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, brie lhem advarice, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the rabers were to climb above and take them into the roar, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in the shoulder, which crushed it down. Aubrey hastened to help him; arid, no longer taking into account the contest or his own poril, is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him, if guards haveten, if Lord Ruthven is wounded, immediately tossed his arms and surrenders.\nBy promising a great reward, Aubrey foon inducted them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their preserve — they simply grumbled him until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had a scam. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days the inortication followed, the arid date paid rapid steps. The sound and appearance had changed not; it also seemed unconscious of the pain that it was bad of the object about him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, arid his after-eye fixed on Aubrey, which wasinduo to offer help with more seriousness than usual —\"Sit me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I die from my existence as little as one of the day passing; but you can drink my horror, your friend's honor. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey replied .—\" I would do anything. If you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in English —I— but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, reading himself with an exultant uiolence ,\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge beyond my crimes or death to any living binge, in any way whatsoever, or what you can see. \" His eyes fainted from their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he laughed on his plow, and no longer braided.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circumstances attended his experience with this man arose on his mind, and he knew that. Why; when he remembered his health, a chilling cold came about him, as if the presenting of something horrible waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel iri that had been left the body, when cl Robher met him, and iriform hlm that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the pinacle of a nearby moon, according to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to him. The cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, dremined to go and cook it on the where the spot he rests. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the ropes or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were pointing at the same stone which on which they had laid the body. For some time, he was dismayed by conjugations, but he eventually fell back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered terrible misfortunes such, and in which all closely conspired to raise superstitious melancholy thal who had grasped on his mind, he decided to leave her, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to pick him up at Otranto, or at Naples, he took care of the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other things, there was a case containing effective severol weapons, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several cold potato daggers. If he turned them and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the defamed dagger in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to get more proof, he found the weapon, and hif he could be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, although in special shape, the sheath he holds in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted to differentiate; but the particulate form, the same varying shades on the shaft and the shoath were similar to the splendor on both, and left no room for serious doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his inquiries about the lady he had assimilated to Lord Ruthuenf soductive arts snalch. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. The spirit of Aubrey bee almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had not been victimized by the destroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and only the occupation consisted of exhorting at the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dearly. He arrived in Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tossed him to the English shores; and he hastened to the home of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appocled to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory in the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she became even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assomblies. There were no bones that light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the ability of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from the misfortune, but from a careful feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a bigger kingdom. His step was not so light, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was never filled with a smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection for him, and in his presence, he would have forgotten those tears that she knew how to enslave his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that if these eyes — the total focus were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. Sbe was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. He had been thought by his guardians more fit for his presentation should be delayed after the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was therefore resolved that the next lounge, which was approaching quickly, should be the time when it entered the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have rather stayed in his father's house, and fed melancholy, which dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind was so torn apart from the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon stopped in the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a dredging room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held so long, and all that was anxious to rest in the middle of the kingship, quickly the third. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was flancing in an honor by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the time first that he had seen Lord Ruthven was at the lizard place — he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and cl voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had the hard courage to turn, afraid to see a spectre that blasl thing, when he perceived, at a distance from a little, the same figure that had drawn the attention of his to his place when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs came back almost to carry their weight, who was forced to take the arm of a cold friend, and forcing a passenger through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was a home driver. He played the room with screaming steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid his washing would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath .— He woke up, he found the riot believing that he could — the dead rise again !— He thought that his evil imagination had conjured the image on which his mind rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; although he tried to ask concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succumb to obtaining informal Jon. He went some night aftercr with his fisher to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and there he gave himself his devoring nostrils. When he finally saw that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he was moving. He went forward, seized the sister's arm, and, with a hurry, pressed her to the street: The door was pedalged by the crowd of servants waiting for their lords; and when he was engaged in the passing them, he again heard this voice whispering near him –\"Roinember your earth !\" – He dared not to turn, but, pressed his sieve, soon arrived at home.\nAubrey has become the most difficult. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how many influences were he completely eng-\nRosse, now, thats the certainty of the monster living again has pressed on the big thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, but in vain she intimidated her to explain to her evil that caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more angry he was. His oath bewildered him; was it therefore permitted for this monster to wander, to sob upon his breath, to almost all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed suspicions, who would believe it? He sought to use his own hand to free the world from misery; but death, he remembered, had been seriously mocked. For days, he remained in this state; he rose up in his room, saw no one, and bound only to sister bis, who, with tears, begged him, for her, to support nature. Finally, no longer carrying capablo bone calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often as in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned to the house in the evening; but at last he crushed him to rest where the fatigue prevented him. His sister, proud of his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pure-sugar reaper, far from everything. It's a condition, however, slightly shook. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he managed to enter society again, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner shivers his sight, his sister was obliged to Iast to beg him to abstairi to seek, for his false, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be a little available, the guards thought they could intervene, and, fearing that his urid would be alienated, they spent a lot of time regaining the confidence that Aubreys parents had previously imposed on the inside.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and eyebrows that he had encountered in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him const. He hardly seemed to notice, so that his mind was absolved by a terrible subject. His incoherence has finally become so great, that he was consinated to his cabarnber. There, he was often licencing for a daily, unable to be awakened. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affliction and reactivation was manifested at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, shaking his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, who wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" He clinged again in a state, when she could even wake him up. This lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his income-\nThe rences became less freckled, and his mind threw a portion of his morosity, while his guardians served, that several times in the day he ran on his fingers a certain number, and they smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians inherited from his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of being Aubrey in such a terrible situation, that his sister would marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this brand of return iritellect, whose they feared it had been deprived, they mention the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey merely pleaded, and astonished them again by expressing his intention to be present on the nuptials, and wishing to see his sieve. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capabilous to be affected by the influence of his lovely smile; for he pressed her to his heart, and kissed her plays, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to stand again alive to feelings of affectionori. He began to talk with all his warmth, and to co-rigralize it on his marriage with a person so difficult for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his breast ;0 Pening her, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had hit his life so long. He split the portrait in a paroxysm of ragc, and trampled under his feet. Asking Bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbclrid, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grasping his hands, and looking at her with an expression frantio of Countrice, he made him swear that she would never marry this monster, for he — but could not advance — it seemed that this voice pleased him again to remember his oath — he suddenly turned around, Lord Ruthven approached him, but he saw no one. In the butimo, the guards and the physicion, who had heard the whole tube, and thought that it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and forcing him Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and begged to delay the bull for a day. They, attributing this to the madness, they imagined having taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been truffled with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's health, he easily understood the cause; when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exvulsion and his picfulness could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this infermation. He hastened to the huff of his former currency, and, by a constant presence, clinged to the pride of great affection for the brother and to interest in his sate, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed ;—could say to how, since one knows hor, his existence, had begun to seem terrifying preferably, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the eldest branch that fell to him in length, which obtained an important emossery, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage tob ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to place the doy even before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor, arid his guardians, tried to bribe the searchers, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sieve, able him, as she valorizes her own happiness, her own honor, arid the horror of those who are now in the grave, who discovered her in their arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would untie him; but by giving him the physician, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubreys spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed on without rest to the busy inmates of the house; and Avbrey heard, with a horror that can be easier than he conceived than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in a frantic almost. The curiosity of the servants of the last weircame their ignorance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the breath of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a relationship, was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his help by force, rushed him out of the room, without fear of fury. On the shelf, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oats and your kriow, except for my fiancée on a day-to-day basis, your sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" He said ,\"He threw him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek him .\" Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and it passed on to the body. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as physiciari, was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and to be married and married to fear that London.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted the guards of his sister to be called, and when the hour of midnight was bad, he took back what the reader had struck, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey, but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had flirted, and Aubrey sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIn Sailing across the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1821, we put in the port of Mityleno, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always your being there, encourage many British ships to visit it — the men of war and merohantmen; and although it is rather out of the rock for the ships bound to Smyrna, its premiums pay amply for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was used in the watering, and the sacriller was negotiating for the wild cattle, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble to the cave Homers Sohool calie, and other places, where we had been before. Ori the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and erected a young Greek as our guide, who told us that which had come from Scio with an English lord, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his festival. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" and he Grecca ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not dare leave Mitylene, where I am likely to be married. It was an addition, but a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in the shadow of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about Lz 50 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not consantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time in the house of thunder where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting lounge, and a bathroom, with an enclosed enclosed space. They were all decorated with simple: hail walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain underneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. There were half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library empty: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had more large maltress spread on the floor, with two colton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greeco. In the lounge we observed marble reves, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large marine chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. On the tablet, the pieces of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of Emplres de Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kolzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Last, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small brochures of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English crochet of any description. Most of these books were filled with notional materials, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over, and marked with sheets of paper, which were also romarks.\nThe old renan said :\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, he must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that I have been to move a thing with orders, to be trodden upon me for a week; it is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; and I had the product of this farm far away the problems of taking care of it, except twenty zechins that I paid to an elderly Armenianri who resided in a small house in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale .\"\nThe appearance of the outer dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty pac es long and fourteen wide, and the canned marble pillars with black paint and fret work cornices (as just now customs in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light-stoned bouquet, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the house lops are furnished, as on them, the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, dr enking light wines, such as \"lachryrna Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the oven breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and firsts gathered together on its edge, and under the shadow of two large bushes blueberries, a marble seat with a wooden back of ornamental was placed, on which we have a woodmold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve hours, blushing, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" sound the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very donut ,\" and always went to our church twice a week, besides Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich valneyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle in flowers, and on the luminite whose ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesty lure. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The fea smaoth in the form of glass, and a borizon not shaken by a single cloud, put the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and plumtrees, small seural islands were observed distinctly, spreading the wave of light blue with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a moro view that I did not do this; but our requests were irrelevant as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solild: no one knew his name but Domlnick, his banker, who had parked in Canada. \"The Armenian\" cried our leader ,\" Could tell, but I sure he won ,\" and can you say, old friend ?\" he said, if I found ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare. We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned the sour details of the late lard. He had shared eight young girls when he lasted on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave the cow call to a man, the horses to the others, and the cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fatherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, according to all whom we have collected, to have been a very eccentric character arid benevolence. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage, should be appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful mast daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left MityIencs peaceful is; our imaginations all over the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He looked obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all the eccentricities of those which inark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, that you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trip to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at MityIene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on the very page. We deeply regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted the rescue with the idea of returning to Milylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely insensitive, and in justice in the good name of its secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing to iriari to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly matched from these lethal concentrations. All the finest hearts of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their soul in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actors: his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a beginning on whose heart, religion was bathed in its seal, and on whose head, Bencvolence threw his mountain. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. We must always be careful, especially when it is directed again towards the moral integrity of a man; and he dares to just before this court awssul which must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a fellow-rnortal. Lord Byron's character means to his genius. Doing good in secret, and escapes from the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Sleet.",
    "4": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Pojdori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, it does not extend to the Greek to until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has usually taken its present form since the TB division of the churches of Lotin and Greeks; at the time which, the idea of becoming predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graces, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a few slight variations, to Hungary, Poland, Austria, on Lorralne, where the beef existed, the total vampyres enthly soaked some of the blood of their victims, who had emancipated themselves, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these human blood suckers became fatified — and their velns became distended to take hold of a repletion stote, to cause the blood of all the passages of their bodies, and even of the pores even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March ,732, is a curious and, of course, a credible account of a particulate case of vampyrism, whooh is said to have observed Madreyga, in Hungary. He seems that at the aris examination of the commander-iriohief and the magistrates of the place, they positively and unanimously affrmed, lhot, aboul fivo years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pclul, had heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampire, but had a way to get rid of evil, by eating part of the earth from the tomb of this vampire, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from taking a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and death, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made that the four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants of the village have consumed their Hadagni, taken the body, and found it (cls are supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting cold mu, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A pole was piloted entirely through Arnold Paul's beauty and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he were bad alive. They cut off his head, buried his body, and threw the ash into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of these people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should be American agents on the clocks who survived them.\nThe universal belief, if that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is redone, it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the current observation than any other likeness that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, death after the accident is considered to be a kind of punishment, an atrocious crime committed while he was in oxidence, that the deceased is not condemned to vampyria, but concerned lo oonfinishes his infernal visits only to those beings whom he levates most while he is on the orth – those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the top, as Varnpyrus scint, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then terribly haunt the tbenative placo, and suck the blood of all thy wreath; There of the daughter Ly, sister, wife, about midnight drain the streom of 1 wife; yet take away the banquet that precedes thy livid living corsus, thy victims, be they expire, shall know the devil for their sire; as thou cursedst thyself, thou cursed them, thy flowers shall be softened upon the stem. But only that for your crime must fall, Theyorigest, beloved besl of all, Sball bless you with a father's dream — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet you have your task and you mark the last tingling of his cheek: the last spark of the eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the non-alcoholic hand, the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest piece of affection has been worn — But now is carried by the Memorial of the time agony! Yel with your best hood will flow; Thygnashing tooth, and lip of the hook; Then hunting at your mud tomb, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits r ave, till these in horror shrink Fram moro cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Southey introduced also into his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalclba\", the vampyorse type of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having turned back brake tbe falls in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But he cannot be supposed to have been rosulted from the sin of his life, to have spread throughout the tale as a type of complete of purity and innocence. The true Tournefortg gives an account in hif travels of several amazing cases of vainpyrism, for which that he claims to have been an eyowitness; and Calmet, in his green park on this subject, hates a variety of anecdotes, and narratives trodiliionaries illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, lending to proof that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can only be concluded by remarks, that the Vampyre lerm is the one in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: af Vrucolocha, Vclrdoulocha, Gou l, Brocolokcl, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, there appeared to several parties of the leaders of the town, a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked around the bim, as if he could participate. Apparently, the laughing light of the fair only obstructed his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into these unwise dreams whoro resigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, attached to the core of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a single glance to pierce through the interior works to the heart; but fell on the cheek with a leclden ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every dung; everyone began to see him, and those who had been accruing to the violent existence, and now felt weightless of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although they are in shape and relief, many female hunters, after notoriety, tried to win her attention, and to win, at least, marks of sorno of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the wick of all the monsters she had in the drawing rooms, threw herself in her way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to stir up her opinion :— although in vain :— that she had stood before him, although her eyes were engulfed by her, still it seemed that they were not understood ;— even her unapplied formudence was floundered, and left herself on the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet it was the spirit of apparent prudence that he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. Hehad, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it is even that it is surpassed the fear of its singular character, or that they mocked its apparent hatred of the vice, it was also often among these women that also boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as we clapp those who push it by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young gentleman named Aubrey arrived in London: he was an orphan left with a single sister in the possession of a great sweat, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He also left by guardians himself, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the guard of the Meroean superalternates, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and caridure, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thethal vice was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, of which seo in romances: he thought that the misery of a house simply consisted in the garment, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patohes. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were a realistic life. It was beautiful, frank, rich arid: for these reasons, upan hls entering the into gay circles, the mary mothers circle hirn, striving that should describe with the least truth, their languishling or farfelu fovourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approaches, and by their sparkling eyes, when he contained bis lipf, soon led in false notiori his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the romané of his solitary hours, he was surprised at the finding, lhat, except in the candles of wax cland of tallow that licked, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundry in real life if there were none of the congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he poorly formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, whose extraordinary being we have above described, crossed the bomb in his caretaker.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in hesels, which gave a few other signs of his obscrvatiori of external objects, lhan tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by avoiding their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine a greedy thing that flattered his prefenance to extravagant idecls, he soon formed this object inlo the hero of a romance, clnd determined to obscure the despring of bis fantasy, rather than the person before him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced to his opinion, that his presence was still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the knot of preparation in — Street, realized that he was eager to travel. Desiring to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, was only his curiosity, hchinted that ses guclrdians, that just was the time for him to make the tour, which for many genres was considered necessary to allow life to take a few quick steps in the vice car to get on an equality with the elderly, arid not allowing them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of competence shewri in the pursuit of the latter. They agreed: and Aubrey, speaking of his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive a proposal to join him. Flammed by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he gladly accompanied him, and in a few days he had passed the surrounding waters.\nThat is right.\nrto, Aubrey had no bad opportunity to study the character of Lord Rvthven, and now found, that, though many of his actions were exploded from his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not the indignation of the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms, that they sent out of the door with barely presumptuous sneezes; but when the profile came to ask some change, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Hiin to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away by a rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greater importuriity of the victims, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstance about the barbarity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because all the citrists were led to scaffolding, or sunk down and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent impatience his companion had towards the centres of a fashionable life; there he entered into the whole spirit of the farotable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but it was always with the same unshakeable fato, with which he generally looked to be society around: he was not, however, so when the young novice eruption was encouraged, or the unlucky foetal of a numeral family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abscracy of the mind was set aside, and his eyes storped with more fire than that of food while delirling with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the formerly rich youth, and slept in the circle which he adorned, in the folly of a dungeon, the fclte which had drawn him into the corner of this friend; while many other sot friantic, in the midst of the looks speaking of mute hungry children, without a single farthling of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present cauring. But he did not take money from the gobbing table; but immediately lost, to the roar of many, the last dorlot that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commenter, capble to forget the trick of the experienced mare. Avbrey often wanted to represent this to his sling, and begged him to resign from this charity and place which proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak to him deviously and openly; however, thif never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his cartage, and in the midst of the various soenes rich in pearly, was always the same: hls eye spoke less than his lip; clnd although Aubrey was neclr the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain gratificati gratificati on it than the conlonleous oxication to want vainly to break this mystery, which to hif exalt the hegan imagination to assume the appearance of something supernalural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey for a while lost sight of his companion; he let him delirium in the morning circle of an Italian country, and he set himself in the witchcraft of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, that he opened with eager for impatience; the first was his sisler, breathing nothing would affect; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately left his treats, and exhorted that his character was dangerously vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more serious to society. It had been discovered that his convulsion for adultery had not given rise to the hatred iri of his sbaracter; but that he required, for his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, be cast into the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the abyss of the abyss and degradation: in line, that all the women whom he had sought, adorning because of the virtue of the air, had, from his departure, cast the mask even aside, and had not burned to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a luminous point on which the eye rests. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, on the average whilc, to monitor it more closely, and also do not let the light circulacs without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly concerned with the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in sourt; but Aubreys eye followed them in all its windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though an infallible daughter. Not wasting any time, he put on Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, insorbing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about your meeting hour that night. The Lord Ruthven was inflamed that his intentions were such that he thought that the entrapment would have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry that he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey resumed; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment, he must refuse to include his Lordship in the reininder of their visit proposed, he ordered his servant to seize other apartments, and by calling the lady's mole, informed him of all that he knew, not only as regards the ber daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. The Assgnatiori has been warned. Lord Ruthven then merely indicted his servant not to consent to a separation, but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself of Atbens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the erased records of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, darkened by ehronjcling the deeds of freemen only in front of the slaves, hid themselves despite the sheltering ground or a lot of col-\nOur police phone. Under the same room class helpelf, there existed being, so beautiful and doljeale, that she could have formed the model for a washing painter to rot on the canv-\nIn Mohammed paradise, except his eyes have spoken too much of mind for any one to this nk. It could belong to those who had no soul. By dancing on the plain, or by stumbling on the side of the mountain, one could have seen a bad type of his riches; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of nature set in motion, for this drowsy look of luxurious of the arimal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in bis search aflater antiquilief, and often the girl vncconscivics, erigagcd in the pursuit of a Kashmere bvtterfl there, would show all the beauty of its form, floating as it was on the wire, tathe avid gaze of him, who forgot the milk which he just deciphered on a tablet almost efface, in the contemplaliori of his figure of sylph. Often her braids would fall, as she wilted arourid, chibit in the ray of the sun tho so delicately shiny and swiftly discoloring the shades, he could well excuperate the forgelfuries of the antiquarian, which letesccle from his mind the very object that he had before thought of the vital importance to properly interpret a passage in Pausanios. But why reach to describe which charms all feel, but no cari appreciate ?— It was innocent, yauth, and beauty, without being affected by the rooms of around drawing and stifling balls. As he drew these remains which he wanted to pass a memorial for his hours of fvture, he stood up, and with the magical effects of his pencil, intraoing the scenes of his native place; she would then describe him the circle dance upori the open peain, painted, lo he in all the brilliant colors of young memoiry, the pompon of marriage, she would reminisce the look in his early childhood; and then, lunning to subjects which had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, caught up all the supremature tales of the nurse hcr. His fortune and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as she told bim the story of the living vampy, which had spent years almost his treats, the most dear arid bonds, forced each ycar, feeding on the life of a beautiful female to lie on her existence for the following mariths, his blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh his ol' bone so idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe was quoting the names of men, who had finally detected one living among the friends'; and when she had found him so incredulous, she begged him to wear it, because he had 6 th, pointed out that those wbo had dared their existence, so incredulously, confessed to him that he had always girdled them, that he had no idea of it. She detailed him the tradition of the Lhesian monsters, and her horror was incredulous, by Uririg, a fairly precise endowment of Lord Ruthven; being, however, still persistent to persuade her, that he could bo no lruth iri her fears, laughing at the same time that he wondered about many coincidences that tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and to cling to Ianthe; his innocent, therefore contrasted with all the offecles virtues of the women among whom he had sought for this vision of romance, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hahits, marrying ari without instruction Greek girl, he found himself even more and bitten attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped himself apart, and, forming a plan for some anti-quarjanic research, he left, determined not to return until his object was set on fire; but to always faltered he was impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an imogue which seemed to allow the rightful owner of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was still the same infancy being that he had known for the first time. She always noticed to separate from him with reticence; but he was guessed that she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite heavings, while her tutor was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had yet escaped from his destructive hand. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and the two, with several present, affirmed their existence, the horror of the pale spirit to his very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they seized the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, because he had to go through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the station of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path of the Jr. Aubrey made light representations, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; and when he saw the trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silting.\nNext morning, Aubrey set off from son exo-\nthe ursion without surveillance; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his boss, and was worried that his words, by chewing the 6th relief of these steep things, had irritated them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Iarithe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to take revenge, and the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the harison there was a spot of those that, in the warmer climates, quickly gather irito to a huge mass, and pour all their rage over the devoted country .— He, however, mounted his horse, determinod to catch up with his sar his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in these southern peaks, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and there who had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely an interval half of rest — its rain heavy forced his way through the making of the canopy, while the forked lightning bleve seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and was carried with rapid dreadsul through the covered forest. Finally, the animal stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least rely on getting shelter from the storm. As he approached, the thurders, for a silent moment, heard him hear the cries of a woman who mingled with him, mocked an exulting laughter, conlinuating one of the almost intact sounds ;— he was surprised; but, awakened by the bumblebee that Agalri was rolling on his announcement, he, with a sudden effort, in front of the door of the hut. He found the total darkness of himself, iri: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, the sounds were still inoperative, and no opinion was the lacustrine of the film. Hc sounded in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a voyoe shouted ,\"Always mocked !\", to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt harassed by him whose strong man seemed to be pulsating: dissuaded from selling his life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was listed with his feet and threw the force on the ground enormously ;– his enemy threw himself up to the height of the hlm, and threw himself on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat – when the brightness of many torchos penetrated by the holo that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;– he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the stretcher of the branches, as he broke the wood, wos no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, and the light of their torches was poured out on the mud walls, and the stubble spread over all the straw with heavy soft flakes. To the desire of Aubrey, Thoy lay down for her who had clinged him by his cries; he was agonized left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst on the bim, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful condress brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an raising vision of the distracted imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence in his face that saw almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his root were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this man pointed, crying, simultaneously struck the horror with ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the slender of her who had recently bred him the object of so many brilliant and magical villains, now salooned with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — if the mind was eaten up and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in a vacaricia — he diligently unconsciously in his hand, a named dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They soon met by different parties who were six years old in fear of the beer that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describing their cries would be impassable; but when they determined the cause of their child's affair, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were inconsolable; the blood diod broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called the Lord Heaven and on Ianthe – by a uriaccolunable combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chonched at this time to arrive in Athens, and, from the other motive, on the assumption of the state of Aubrey, immediately pilaced himself in the same house, and incarnates his constant servant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified arid astonished at the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, the connectedness, and the care that he showed, soon reconciated to his presence. His sentence seemed completely changed; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalence began to be rapid, he gradually rotated the same state of mirid again, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, excepling that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, with a smile of insulting exultation jng on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted hmm. During the final stage of the re-establishment of the invillid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the infallible waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to marking the progros of the tbose orbs, encircled, like our world, the lost moving sun ;— he seemed to fight to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elaslicity of the mind that had one. so distriguished it, the crowd seemed to run away never sore. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he was sought in the midst of his ruins which he had previously frequented, the form of Iclnthe stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods of Tbe, a lighter step would seem to sow the wood water, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly would turn around, show his imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He has determined to steal the scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom which was held unpunished by the tender care he had taken of him during the illness, while they should visit the parts of Greece neither still had a séon. They traveled in all directions, and looked for each place to cling to the recollection; but although they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at at the above. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to seize these relationships, whereas imagination was only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the genorosity of those that they defended against the preconceived dangers. As a result, of neglecting the advice of lho habitarits, once they crossed with only a few gvards, more to serve as guides as defense. Upon entering, However, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, where great measures of rocks descended from the neighboring precipioes, they had a reason to repent of their negligentco; for scarcely were all the parties engaged in the narrow collar, that they were started by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo report of several guris. In an instant, the guards had left them, and, standing behind the rock, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, withdrew for a moment behind the turn of the defilement of Tobe: 6th shameful to be shot down by an enemy, who, insultingly, shouted in advance, and being exposed to slavery without resistance, if the army of the thieves were to cling over and take in the back, they immediately decided to rush into the witch of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubroy hastened to rush into his asphyxiation; and, no longer listening to the peril of the challenger, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around Bim, his guards having, on Lord Rulhvens being, immediately cast their arms and handed over.\nBy the promises of a great raid, February soon pushed them to transport wounded people to a nearby cabin; and, having combined on a train, they were no longer disturbed by their presence — they were content with it. Keep the entrance until their computer returns with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His arid conduct had not changed; he seemed unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but to say the close of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and the busy eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was endured with the help of his help with more than the usual fortune —\" Help me! I don't mean my life, I didn't listen to the decline of my existence like one of the passing days, but you can save your friend's honor. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I could have done anything ,\" replied Aubrey. \" I need, but a few things — my life flourishes — I can explain everything — but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was the free mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with excitement ,\"Smile with all your soul resent, with all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my dreams or death to any bining living in any misfortune, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I made a swcar !\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing on the pillow of his, and he no longer breathed.\nAuhreyrelired to rest, but did not sigh; the many circumstances that saw his knowledge with a man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his almond, a cold shiver came upon him, as is of lunch presontiment of something horrific waiting for him. He was about to seize the body, when a thief took him away and informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been transported by himself and by comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that who had given his secretary, that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon, the last rose after his death. Aubrey deafened himself, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury in the place where he was. But when he got into the smoke, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were pointing the same stone at what they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the fake ciothes.\nWeary of an Irish country that had met with such terrible mistakes, and in which all appearedryly conspired to increase this superstitious melaricholy who had grasped the mind, he decided to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to send him to Otranta or Napies, he took care to organize with him the effects that belonged to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case that contaminates several weapons of crime, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his overprice to sing a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as being daguerdovcred in the hut of fatcll — he shuddered — hastened to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, and his harror can be imagined when he discovered that he corresponded, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need further certainty; he seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; however, he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same shade shades on the half and the sheath were also in splendor in both, and loft no place for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, his first inquiry checked the lady he had tried to capture Lord Ruthuen seductive arts. Her parents were in the distros, their fortune was rolling, and she had not been listening since the departure of her secretary. Every spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been victimized by the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only job was to overcome the postiliori speed of tobe, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calajs; a breeze, which seemed to obey his will, soon swayed him on the banks of the English; and he called at the house of his fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all the memory of the leg. If previously, through her infantile carcasses, she had gained her affection, now that the began woman appeared, which was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning the grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the bright spirit. There was a melancholy eharin about it that did not seem to emerge from miffortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which set you in motion indicates a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not such as the foot, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. Alone, his face was never dazzled by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection, and wanted in his presence to forget those details. She knew he had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the voluntary? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eight years old, and had not been introduced to the world. That is, she had thought by the guards that her presentation should be delayed from the return of her brother from the continent, while he could be his protector. It was now, heresore, solved that the next salon, whob was fast approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse sawmill\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the mansian of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that had overturned him. He could not feel interested in the frivolous fashioned strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the proteclion of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for the next day, while having made himself become announced like a living room.\nThe c rowd was an excess of love – a draw-rooin had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a corner near him, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the recollection that, the first time he had seen Lord Ru, then wos in that same place, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fear of seeing a spectre that would blow HLM up, when he was picturing, a little distance away, the same figure who had struck his opinion on the spot when he first entered the company. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a sling, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven even before hiin—circumstances stifled in arroy terrible—the dagger—his oath .— He woke up, he does not believe that possible—the dead are still rising !— He thought his imagination had ruined the magic on which his mind rested. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few laughs after with his sister to the assembly of anear relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he bound himself into a reef, and there he gave himself to his own devo...\nSounds like the thoughts. Pereeiving, last coat, that many were on the run, he woke up, and entering another room, found the sister he surrounded by several, appears in serious conversation; he always had the intention to pass and approach her, when the one who he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him those traits that he ranst abroad. He went forward, shook the sister's arm, and, with a whiff, forced her to the street; and at the door he found himself in a bliss with the crowd of swindlers fleeing for their lords; and while he was engaged by passing them, he held back the voice which drew near to him :«Remember your oath !\" He dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, soon carried.\nThe Aubrey has become very disconcerted. If before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the life of the monfter has pressed again on his floggings. His sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in Valn that Sbe instructed him to explain to him what had coincided with his abrupt conduct. He spoke a few words, and those who were terrified. The more which there is, the more he goes astray. His oath surprised HLM ;— Thewashe tuna to allow this monster to wander, carrying round over his breath, in the midst of all that he held, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his sister was touched by him. But even if he went to break his oath, and to decipher his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such a wretched; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For the day, he was born again in this store; locked in his room, he saw a rio one, and ate only when his sister camo, who, with tears flowing from the eyes, begged Hiin, for his own good, to support the nature. Finally, it is no longer easy to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, beaten with street to street, anxious to steal this image that flouted him. His dress becomes neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the mid-day even as to the humidity of the night. He was no longer recognized; at first he came back with the evening house; but to close he laid him down to roam wherever fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to flank him; but they soon became distracted by him who fled from a runaway purfy more than any thought. His driver, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he had left him by his whole absence friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into the sawhood, and to watch him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached the intimacy with. Bull, when he entered a room, his discontented and hagnar eyes were so striking, this inward so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the tang the guards were fit to intervene, and, fearing that that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought that it was high to resume that trust which was bad before imposed by Aubrey parties.\nDespered to save him from the evils and sufferings which he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor to reside in the house of Tbe, and took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, so completely was his mind absarbed by a terrible subject. His influence became too great, that he was confined to his room. There, he would lie for the days, inconsistent to be awake. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier ;— the only figure of the defection and of the remaining memory appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near HLM !\" When, however, she asked whom she preferred, her only answer ,\"True! True !\" And again, he sank a slate into, from which even she could raise a line. This makes it easy for a lot of months: gradually, as the year passes, his incoherencos become less frequent, and his mind shakes a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observe that several times in the day, he counts on his fingers a defined number, then smiles.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the day of the year, one of his grandparents inherited from his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such a horrible situation, when if the sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this reverent intellect brand, which they feared had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present with the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. It seems that Hewaf was again affected by the influence of his first smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed the cheek, wet with tears, slowing down to the thought that his brother was once alive with feelings of affection. Ho began to speak with all his warmth and to congratulate her on her marriage with so distinguished a person for her rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on her chest; when he leaned on her, what was his surprise at looking at the features of this monster who so badly influenced his life. He grabbed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, to be looked at as if he did not understand her, then to grasp her hands, and to look upon her a frantic expression of cauntenance, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monfter, for being — but he could not advance — it seemed that this voice again signaled to her of his faith — he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was never but saw no one. Meanwhile, the grandparents and the doctor, who had an entire card that, and thought it was only a return to his disorder, entered, forcing the fram Mifs Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He sold them on his stuff, and begged them to put an end to it, but for a day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, had taken possession of his spirit, closed down to pacify it, and connected.\nLord Ruthen had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with each else. When he heard of the evil beauty of Aubrey, he understood perfectly that it was he who was the object of it; but when he learned that he had been denied, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be extracted from those who were among him, he obtained this innocent woman. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by a hard presence, and the pretened of great affection to brother arid increases in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who can resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to retract – could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy for being ari on the overcrowded earth, except with the beer to whom he addressed himself ;— could say how, as he knew her, his existence, had begun to appear early of preservation. If it was simply that he could listen to his soothing acolytes ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or so badly the will of destiny, that he won his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large cambe, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed story of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the correction.\nAubre there, when he was left by Tobe physiclan and his guardians, tried to bribe his servants, but in vain. He asked for the pain and the paper; it was given to him; either wrote a letter to his sister, wounding her, as she waved her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those now in the grave, which once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of the house to be dull, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to hold Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be easier to conceive than deerbite, notes of busy preparation. Morning came, on the sound of the wagons after breaking on his ear. Audrey grew almost the frontal. The curiosity of the servants, at last, their vigilance, they flew away gradually, leaving the hive in the cuslodie of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with the orie bond was out of the coin, and in a moment was found in the apartment that it was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm, the force, rushed him into his room, furious without a voice. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\" Remember your oath, and know, if you are not engaged, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" Sighing, he pushed the ball to his entourage, which, awakened by the old woman, had come to the sea of him. Aubrey no longer supported himself; his rage, which was not a vent, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor feared shaking him. The marriage was salted, and a bridge and a hridegraom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increases; bloodshed produces TB symptoms near the approach to death. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he told in a composite way that the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened Miss Aubreys protection; but when they stopped, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, on Aubreys sister had slipped the third of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\ne: CAC -!\nAMOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF the LORD BYRON, & .\n\"The world attends him all, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of its majestic ships, in the year 1812, we placed in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this region, and the supply of certain cattle and vegetables that must always be there, lead many British vesfels to visit it — both men of war and merchanlmen; and although there is rather out of the way for the boats bound to Smyrna, his bountief largely reimbursed for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the boot of hay, and while the rain was used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble at the cave homer's school, and other places where we were before. On the front of Mourit Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, but left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"Ho hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would take me with a bim; but I did not dare leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a strange man ,6 on a very good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, is consecrated to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the merchant of Winc, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in hif felucca very delen to the various islands .\"\nThis story excited our curiosity very much, and we did not waste time hastening into the house where our compatriot had retired. We were kindly received by the old man who cast us over the mansion. It can accommodate four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting living room, and a bed-restaurant, with a spacious arinexed wardrobe. They were all decorated with simple: light green walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the inner part, and a small fountain below, which could be crazy to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed in the side of a small Verius bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furn-\nSure. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library empty: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. This bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the common bed through our Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble niche. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not have the ink noseeues justified iri clammining elements. On the tablet of the recess are the works of Voltaire, Shakespearo, Boileau and Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerinan, in the German language, the Messiah of Klopstock, the rivals of Kolzebue, the play of Schiller des Robbers, the Paradise Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810, several small pamplets of the Greek press at ConstontinopIc, very torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messioh literally wrote the whole cover, and it was marked with sheets of paper, on which there was also remorse.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books before he left, and he forgot to place others; but, he said, he must lie until his return; for he is so special, that if I moved an unordered lunch, he would frown me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. Once I made him a service; and I had the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I paid to an old Armerian who resides in the small house in the wood, and who brings the Lord Brugbt here from Adrianople; I do not know why the reason .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen hroad, and the canned marble pillars with black pillars and f ret-work cornices ,( as it is now usual in Greek architecture ,) were curidaly higher than the roof of lbe. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, walls covered with a fine Turkish earpiece, brieath and wearing a linen strong coarfe. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them, the Greeks have their evenings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christ\", eating fruit, and joining the evening breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, first arid oranges gathering on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental waaden bar, on which we were told, the Iord spent many of his evenings and nights until the twelve hours, reading, the scribe, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always ottensified a week twice, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A linen of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, and on the top of which a Greek elephant was destroyed appeared in a majestic lure. A small stretcher moves away from the ruins of Tbe des candred in broken cafcades, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a harizon shadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a view of high chesnul and palm trees, several single lands carried distinctly observed, pulling out the blue wave light with spots of emerald green. I had a more beautiful view than what I did; but our universities were without fioriture as the name of Tbe who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name but Damjnick, his bariker, who had gone to C India. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I sure he won ,\"and can you, an old friend ?\" said I ,\"if I can,\" I said ,\"I won't dare\". We didn't have any time to visit the Armenian, but on over back in the city we learned the sovereign details of the isolated lord. He had a portion eight young girls that he was the last on the field, and even danced with them at the nuptial seat. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who lived by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a gale, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he appeared to us, from all we collocated, to have been a cl character very occentric and benevolent. We have learned that our former friend at the cottage has thought only is capable of diselising. He had the most beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had made him a piano-strong, and taught him how to use it.\nSuch was the information with which we moved away from the island of the peace of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the grid, guessing who this ramblerin G reserve could be. He had money. It was obvious: he had a philanthropy of dispositian, arid arid these eccentricities that mark a peculiar genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the camp with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a WYATTIC pilot, who had traveled to Egypt and Greeco ,\"Individual TB\", he said ,\"about what you are so anxious about, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We did not have the glory of his secretary, as we had done a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Caleas recluse on the same page. We deeply regret not having been more curious about our research on the hillside, but we have comforted ourselves with the return of the lead to Mitylene ori on a future day; but to me that day will come again. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of her secretary, which has been severely slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as we can fully see from these little anecdotes. All the sons of the ear, so elegantly represented in the pooms of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and tenacity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of the suicide, if an additional reserve to mark him as a being on which the Religion sealed his heart, and above which the head of Benevolence threw the mantle. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as her, I love operations are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a horrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confreremortal. Lord Byron's character is the glory of his genius. To make the right secret, it is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-eourt, Fleet-street.",
    "5": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this table is based is very general in the East. That is what we have to do. It seems common to the Arabs: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed only the present form of the just since the division of the Latin and Greek bears; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a body of Latin could not be corrupted if it were hurdled on their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from the tombs of Tobeir, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful Tbe. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the emperors were imbating a certain part of the burden of the victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and especially died of consumption; while these bvman suckers were greasing — and their veins became distended such a state of repletion, so that the blood flowed all the passages of their body, and even of the proof of their skins.\nIn the Journal Londori of March 1732, is a curious and, of course, a credible account of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is declared at the level recorded in Modreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an oxaminotion of the commander-in-chief and justices of peace, they were defeated positively and unanimously, that, about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing bimsels with lime blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming himself called vampy; for, about twenty or thirty days swollen his date and burial, many people complain of having been tormented by him, and a deposit was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other music, the incapacitants having Cansuit their Hadagni, took the odyb, and found it (as is supposed to be usual in vampyrism casf) fresh, and enjoy free from corruption, and emitting clt mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid blood. The evidence was thus obtained, they resorted to the chocolate remedy. A stake was led entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, where either Js would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same mistakes were adapted with the corsef of the prsoris who had previously died from vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, the bee agent on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person fucked that a vampyre becomes a good mpyre himself, and checks in turn.\nChief Cliff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it is adapted to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other forum that may be presented. In many Greek priests, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his infested visits only to those beings who loved most on earth, those they were bound by kinship and affection.\nBut first upon the earth, as Vompyre sent him, Tby Corsica will be praised from the thamb; then haunt the land of birth, and suck the blood of all thy rèe; there of thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the flow of life; And yet take away the bank that performs Muft will feed thy corse livid living, Your uictims, are still exhaled, Sball knows the devil for their sire; As you cursed, you cursed them, Your turrets aro flied on the stem. But the courage that for your crime must fall. The young man, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flames! Yet you must put an end to your arid task marks the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see what freezes over they unvivable blue; then wilb unhalowod hand will tear thick braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the thorn of Affilon was carried the promise — But now is broken away from your Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your grinning tooth, and your hook lip; and then groaning at your mud tomb, go, and make Gouls and Afrits gratify, until those who are in horror go away from the cursed thing than today.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his world but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having reborn from the grave with the aim of tormentingjnghirn that she loved better when in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resisted on the sinneress of her life, she has 6 th pivorta loudly the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for which he claims to have been an eyewitness cln; and Calmct, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of clneodotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added;\nThis is a question that arises in the context of the analysis of developments in the situation and developments in the world.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, we appeared here to several parties of the leaders, if the story was a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than for its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fcler attracted only his attention, only poisoning by a glance stifles him, and casts fear into those breasls where the gypsy reigned. Thofe, who felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where Jt arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the objoct, did not seem to penetrate, and to a glaneeto pierce through to the iriword workers of the heart; but feil on the cheek with cl ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be irritated in every house; all wanted to see him, and those who were used to violence excitedly, and now felt the weight of boredom was happy to have something in their oapable presence, engaging their attention. In spite of the emotion of passion, which has never gained a warmer tint, eitber fred the blush of modesty, or of this strong emotion of passion, the farm and the beautiful water contours, mary of the hunter after notoriety tendod to gain her attention, and to win, at the leost, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, wbo had been the mockery of monster of urery worn in the drawing rooms slnee her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything except put on the dress bone a montebank, to attract his attention :— though in vain :— when she stood before him, her eyes were apparently fixed upward, he ignited as if they were not seen ;—had her incomprehension been flouted, and she left the field. But common adultery could not influence the obvious guidance of his eyes, it was not that the final sex was indifferent to him; but this was the apparent action with which he spoke to the virtuous wife arid innocent donut, that few ever knew that he addressed himself to women. However, he had the reputation of having a winning language; and even if he had overcome the fear of his singular character, or were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was often close among the women who make up the fact of their mestic virtues, as among the those who push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time, he came to London, a young gentleman of Aubrey's name: to be an organ left with a single sister in possession of Greeklt well, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by guards, who so much so that they took due care only of his fortune, while they reinquised the greater charge of his urid in the custody of the subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his individual. He had, chance, this high sense of honor and frankness, which every day ruined so many apprentices. They kept on sympathizing with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown away by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the rnifery of a cottage consisted simply in the unveiling of eliothes, which were so warm, but which were more suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and their colorful colored patbes. He thought, very well, that the dreams of the ponies were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many demobers surrounded him, slivring who shoed to describe with the least truth, their languishing or crawling favorites: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating counlenones when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he soon made him pass in false nolons of his talents and merit. Attached as he was the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the suif cold candles of thal clickered wax, not of the prosence of a gbost, but srom lacks snuffing, there was not a real jri foundation lisé for the variety of these congreries of pleclishing images and descriptions contained in these volumes, of whom he had formed the study hif. However, by finding some compensation in bis gratis vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when 6 extraordinary years ago we saw above, the crosfed in the career of this.\nHe walchod bim; and the very inconceivable to form an idea the character of a man entirely absorbed in hiinself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, lhcln tacit agreement to existence, implicitly by the avoidance of the contact of tbeir: allowing his jmagination to imagine everything that flattered his prapensity to extravagant ideas, hesoon formed this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to obsess the progeny of fantasy hif, rather than the person before him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced to his opinion, that his presence was still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Stevens affairs were taken, and soon found snored the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was cool to travel. Desiring to obtain the information of mind concerning this singular character, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to persorve love, which, for many generations, has been deemed necessary to emerge young people to take a few quick steps in the caroeur of vice to be pounded on an equality with agony, and not to lower them to appear as if fallen in the sky, when above several intrigues cre mentioned as subject of pleasure or praise, according to the degree of competence seen iri corrupting them on. They consented: the young Aubrey immediately, speaking to Lord Ruthven about his intentions, was surprised to rejoice at a proposal from him. Flattened by Suoh, a mark of His esteem, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the water of cycling.\nHitberto, Aubrey had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthvens character, and now he found that although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in liberality ;— idleness, vagaond, and boggar, reappeared from his hand more through to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey could not avoid notice, that he was not virtuous vpon tbe, repulsed to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him even upori virtue, which he granted his alms ;—these were sent fred the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate oame asked homebing, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to murow in his lust, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. It was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of being vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was fatill more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was stored, inevitably found that there was a curse on just, so they were all led to the scasfold, or sunk to the law and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Avbrey was surprised at the apparent agemess with which the companion bis sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; one entered into all the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known was his antagonlst, and then he lost even more than he was going; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he generally looked at the arorid society: it was not, However, so when he encountered the young novice eruption, or sat down without luck from a great family; then his very wish seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent obstroctity of the mind was set aside, on his eyes sparks more sire tuna than from bed while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In addition, he left the old rich youth, Tom from the circle that he adorned, cursing, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this siend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without only farthing of his last immense wealth, which to buy even sufficient to satisfy their precdent desire. But he has no money from the table; but immediately lost, to McLnys ruiner, the last girl that he had just pulled from the convulsive apprehension of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commentevor, capable of combating the cnrianing of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and beg him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and does not tend to his own profile.\nt ;— but he delayed him — every day to hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly afraid to him; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenques, always finds the same thing: his eye spoke less than his limb; and Tangb Aubrcy was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratitude than the constant excitement of vainly wanting to break this mystery, which at his exalted irnagination began to assume the appearance of something fupernclural.\nThey soon arrived on Romc, and Aubrey spent time losing sight of his companion; he left the bim in presence every day in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was committing himself in this way, letters came from England, which was plagued by ardent impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; others were inflamed by his guardian, the latter surprised him; if he had already penetrated into his total imagination, there was an evil power redoubted his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he left his friend enigmaticly, and exhorted, by his character, the victims horrendously, so that the possession of the irresistible powers of seduction would make his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had been covered, tell his contempt for the adultery, not oujginné in the hatred of his baracter; but that he had demanded, to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinnacle of the vnsueed virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women of the bone whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and had not scrupulously to expose the deformity of the tbeirvices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined up to on to leave the orie, of which eharaeter had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to refute the oye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, purges, in the sense, more closely, and not to let pass any circumstance of the flight. Hc entered into a samc circle, and soon perceivcd that bis Lordship was trying to sow the inexperience of the little lady whose hc briefly fequened. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmingled woman is encountered in society; so he was obliged to pursue the plans in secret; but every eye trampled him in all his windings, arid soon discovered that a wrong assignment was designated, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though unfinished. Not wasting time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and bim abruptly dared his intentions with respect to the lady, insorting him at the same time that he was aware of his being close to meeting his throat for a very long time. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that he believed that all the world had an opportunity on such; and after being in a hurry that he clinged to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, unequivocally writing a note, los say, that from then on he must dooline accompany bis Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seek you other opartments, arid calling the lady's mother, informed him of all will know, not only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the character of his Lordship. The award was avoided. The next day, Lord Rutbven merely indicted his fervour to nullify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys intolerance.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubroy directed his slopes to Greece and crossed the Peninsula. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the regs faded from a very content on monuments which, apparently, shameful to cbranicate the acts of free men only besieged slaves, had hidden in themselves sheriath the sheltering ground or coloured mony lichon. Under the roof of the Sarna, there existed being, so beautiful and so delicate, that she could have formed the model of a peeriter who wanted to pour on canvases, the promised hope of the paradise of false land Mohammed, except that his eye spoke a lot of spirit for someone to think that she could dive to those who have no souls. As she danced on the set, or stumbled along the side of Mountclin, one could have bought from the gazelle, a bad type of her peat; for those who would have exchanged his eye, app-\nthe eye of the unimagined nature, for this look of luxurious sleeping with animal being adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe oflen accompanied Avbrey in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, erected in the pursuil of a kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, flating as he was upon the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, wbo forgotten the Ictères which he had jufted on a tablet of almoft efsaced, in contemplation of his figure sylph-liko. Otteri would be her trolling braids, cold shoes flitted around, exposing in the rose of the sun so delicately shined and swif-\nHe might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian tribe, who let escape from his mind the temptation even he had before thinking of the vile importance for the appropriate interpreter of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no cari appreciation ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stiffing balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, which would stand by, and looked at the magic effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of his native plagiarism; she would then describe him the dance encircled on the peain operiphery, would extend to him, in all the brilliant colors of the memory of Youthfu 1, the marriage pump that she remembered in her machine; then, turning the truth subjects had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, would tell him all the supernatural talos of her nurse. Her bitterness and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the euen interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had pafed years in the midst of her friends, and the loves, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to bring her out of so many idle and horrible fantasies; bull Iantho quoted the names of the old men, who had forgotten for the last time a living between them, after the severol of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of the thofie; and when she found him so inord, she waved with bim to lighten him, for it had noticed that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had a proof, which forced him to them, of mind, and heart, to confess to it. She detailed him the appearance of these monsters, her horror was incracked, hearing a rather acruated description of Lord Ruthven; however, he persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time wondered the many coincidences that all tended to excite belief in Lord Ruthvens supreme power.\nAubrey began to attach himself more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so cantrapped with all the affected virtues, the womo among whom he had sought the big vision of love, gained his heart; being set in motion as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still hc found himself increasingly attached to the almost fairy-like form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, abandoning a plan for some antiquary research, he left, dissuaded from not returning until his object was set in motion; but he still found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins of the table around him, while in his mind he kept a tall image of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child that he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate from him with reluctance; but it was because she no longer had anyone who could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or undoing a fragmerit which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyros, and both, with several present, affirmed their ecstasy, the pale of horror to the very uncle. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one or two of his excursions, and to stop him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him not to come back at night, because he had to necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after dawn, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heavy ailments of moss as an immensely poor one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and threw himself to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his ring so da to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his unattended excursion; people were surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and were concerned that their words, flouting the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them from such a terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of the horse bis, and sincerely prayed to him to return, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy in his resorah, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the horjzon there was one of those spots which, in the warm climates, so quickly gather in a mass lremendous, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He, however, climbed to the paw his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the so southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and where he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his exuberant thunders had barely a resting interval — his heavy rain heavy forced the way through the cariopying foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet itself. Suddenly, his horse took fruits, and he was overwhelmed with dreodfulrapidity through the tangled forest. The animal finally, through the faitgue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that barely raised upwards from the masses of dead breads and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust himself to get the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed HLM to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a first age, continued in an almost intact sound; he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled his head again, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, for, though he anointed, always sounds continued, and nothing was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone, whom he grasped immediately; when a voice cried out ,\"Agairi bafflod!\" to whom a beloved laugh succeeded; and he laid himself prey to the one whose force seemed to be human: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, who wrestled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw huge forces against the ground; – his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had lifted his hands on his throat – when the brightness of many torches that were running through the hole of Tbe deluded him; he immediately rosa, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the crash of the branches, as he broke in the wood, was heard rio longer. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, inlaid with moving, soon heard by this without. They came in; the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each straw with heavy flakes of foot. To the desire of Avbrey tbey secrr for hcr who had omited him by his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his righteous masterpieces brought into lifeless Corsica. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he still saw the same form when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on the cheek lip; but there was a silence obsessed with his face that clinged almost as life lived there :— on his neck and chest was biood, on his throat were the markers of teeth having opened the vein :— to his men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" One litter was quicklyformed, and Aubrey was said by the side of the ber that was recently that the object of luminous and fairy-tale somany vision, now fallen with the life of a defect that had died in it. Heknew not what his thoughts were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to flee reslectiori, and to take refuge in the vacation — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by different parties who had engaged in the book in search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as the city approaches, warns the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their sorrow would be impossible; but when they saw the close of the death of their umbrella, they took to Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were inconceivable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often deirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an irreproachable combination, he began to beg his form of currency to spare the being. At the other time, he would go to his head and curse him by cursed. Lord Ruthucn, waved in time this also arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, hearing the state of Avbrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. He went away from his delirium, he was borrified by the stortlod in the image of the one he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by kind words hjs, involving almost repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, the anxiety and the carc which showed, soon reconciled with the hls preseriee. His lordship seemed completely changed; he appeared only the apathetic thing that had so enthusiastic Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence moved to be fast, he gradually retraced in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perc-\nHe had no difference with the old man, except at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a sense of rnalistic exultation playing his lips: he did not know why, but the smile haunted him. During the last stage of the cover of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook with fear to look at the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of the orhs in those, turning, like our world, the neckless sun ;— in fact, to appear at wisbto avoid the eye of all.\nThe mind of Aubrey, by this shock, was weakened much, and this elasticity of the which spirit had once so distinguished hlm now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for solitude, the spirit did not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought in the midst of the ruin which he had once frequented, the form of Iantbe stood by his side – if he sought him into the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly round tvrning, to his wild imagination, pale face and wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He decided to steal sories, all of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender core which he had taken from help during his illness, to visit these ports if Greece had seen again. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but although they rushed from one place to another, they did not look after what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to attack these reports, which imagined were only the invention of the individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. Because of this neglect of the residents' counsel, once they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On entering, however, a leaking defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks brings down the neighbouring precipices, they had the reason to repent of their negligence; for it was hardly the party that entered the riarrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their pearls, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves buried rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Rvthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a mummerit behind the tower of cover of defiled tbe: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with shouts insulting bode thcm advanced, and beirig exposed to massacre without resisting, if one of the tho-robbers should rise above and the lako in the back, they soaked both to precipitate the search iri of the enemy. They had a little shelter from the rock, and Lord Rulhven received a shot in the shoulder, which put him down. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer holding the contest or his own peril, is surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — bis guards who, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately threw away their weapons and surrendered.\nBy the promise of a great reward, Aubrey soon incited TBEM to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and, by agreeing on a ransom, he was more troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their comrade returned with the promised sum, for which he had held an order. The strength of Lord Ruthveri quickly diminished; in two days the mortification followed, and Death seemed to be accompanied by hurried steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as uriorizing the pain he had been from the object cts aboul; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and the busy eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his resistance with more serious thori usual —\"Assist me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I heard Ibe decline in my existence as little as that of the day of possessing; but you have sealed my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? Tell me how? I would do anything ,\" replied Aubrey. e :\" need a little — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"-\" We don't know him. \"Sweecler by the soul of Yaur, by all your fears, swear that for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any being in any way, whatever may jump, or what you can see. \"His eye took hold of their bases :\" I swear !\" Brad Aubrey; he sank on his pillow, and he no longer breathed.\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his ocquaintance with this man blushed on his belly, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he snored the present of horrific something awaiting him. When a thief met him, and informed him that there was no loriger, he was canveyed by himself and his comrades, retired, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to the promise they had made to his lord, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Abbrecy astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury in the place where he was. But when he climbed to the top, he found no trace of eating the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they pointed the same rock on which they had laid the body. Indeed, his rnirid was bled in corijectures, but finally came back, convinced that they had buried the body of Tbe for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he had decided to leave him, and soon orviated to Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naples, he worked to organize the effects he had with a bim belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other cases, there has been one case where\nWeaporis of the offence, more or less adapted to the death of the victim. There were several daggers on the Afghans. As he killed them, and examined their curious arms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with iri of the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hasteri to obtain other evidence, he has his weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, tuangb particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the shaft and sheath were similar in splendor in both, and left no place to doubt; there were also blood drops on each.\nHe left Smyrncl, and on his way back to Rome, if the first investigations were on the lady whom he had striatched from Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their forturia ruined, and she had not heard of beer since the dispersal of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost restrained under so many repressed horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the Santa destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort speed beyond postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dearly. Ho orlived al Cllais; a breeze, which seemed to obey his wall, soon balfted hlm on the English coast; and he hastened at the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri that kisses and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infarline caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she clings more like a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had the riot of winning the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There wasn't that brilliant light that exists only in the beatod atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His eye was never lit by the levity of the beneficial spirit. There was an inelancholy carin wrapping it that caused the riot seems to be born of a mlssortune, but with a little expense inside, it appeared to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His foot wasn't that a fiery little girl, who wanders where a butterfly or a color can linger, that is, a sedative and pensive waf. When alone, his face was never shaken by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection, and would experience forget these deed that she knew destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seems modible as if these eyes—this face then played in the light of their own notifying space. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been presented to the world, because she had thought by her Canadians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the country.\nIn the end, when he is his protector. It is now, therefore, resolved that the next salon, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the best father, mansian, and fed on the melancholy that aborted him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the extent he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in Taiwan, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a diving room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing raid had not been held to be a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the royalcity, they rushed. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he huddled with a pickle alone, he listened to everything around him, engulfed in the real memory, the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, suddenly felt his sons saw by his arm, and a voice was too well recognized, sounded to his ear --\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing that a spectre would fly, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his riot at this place as soon as he first entered society. He looked until his Iimbus almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a treat, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he rushed into his car, and was driven home. He rushed into the room and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Heaven again before him – flattered circumstances – dagger – his coats. – He woke up, he could be – the dead resurrection again! e :– He thought his imagination had conjured the image that his mind was resting. It is impossible that he can be real because therefore decided to go back to society; for although he tried to strangle the Lord Rutbven, the name hung on the lips bis, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He left a few nights after bringing his sister to the assembly in a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave her a feeling to her own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that money was leaving, he awakened his sons, and entered another room, surrounded by several of his sisters, apparently in the carnest coriversatiori; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and resumed to bim those characteristics, he was most horrified. And he went forth, and slew his sister's arm, and in haste he forced her toward the street; and at the door he began to stand aside by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing over them, he heard the whispered voice beside him :\"Remember your oath !\", he dared not turn, bvt, harrying his sister, soon reochedhorne.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If, before his mind had been absorbed by a victim, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on half the purchase. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, arid, it was in vain that she intimidated him to tell him what had caused her brutal conduct. He only uttered a few words, and thus terrified him. The more he thought of the mare that he was puzzled. Hisoath was astonished with a bim ;— was he then to allow this moron to roam, to have a ring that ruined his breath, in the midst of all that he did, and not to avoid his progress? He got a shot by him. But even if he had to break his goal, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought that if he deployed his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, which remembered, bad behavior had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he sowed no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for her, to sustain nature. In the class, no more able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from the street to the street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. Hjf because the nuclear dress, arid ho wondered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight wets. He was no longer recognized; he first returned to the house of Tobe; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue overtaken him. If the sister, anxious for the busy society, imploded people to upset him; but he was soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer more than any thought-srom. His conduct, however, suddenly driving. Stru ok with the idea that he left by his ahsence the wholo of his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society inlo, and to watch him closely, anxious to do wrong, despite his oath, all those who Lord Ruthven approach with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his baggard and the suspicious looks were so striking, his inner chills so visible, tell his sister will finally be forced to beg him to refrain from looking, if he had his space, for a society that flowed so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards showed interstitialness and, in making it appear that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that was before being imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had experienced daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye those who are in the darkness of what they consumed madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, arid take care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His bidding became so great that he was confined to his room. He is often lying there for days, inoapahle to be a rouff. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— either only the sign of the front and the remaining memory appeared on his sister's entrance; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with the bitterly distressed appearances, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't praise him ,\" if your love for me is great, don't come near him! However, when she asked whom he was speaking to him, his only answer was :\" Really! And again it sank in a state, that there was no even a case that would have caused it. This lasted for months: gradually, archever, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind cast away from his morosity, while the guards of this observed, that several times in the hc day would count on his fingers a defined number, and then smile.\nThe time held almost arrived, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with his doctor on the melancholy circumcite of Auhreys being in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Aubreys alteration was stirred; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, from which they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young Count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and amazed them even more by expressing his will to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his story. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his beautiful sinile; for which pressing his chest, arid kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again allied to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his heat wontod, and your congratulations check on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a locket on his breasl; open it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who held so long instilled his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled the interior foot. When he asked him why he thus destroyed the resemhance of his future just and looked as if he did not understand the ber, then took hold of his hands, and looking at the ber with a frantic expression of his face, he made him swear that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not advance — it seemed af if this voice clari reminded him of his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Rutven was near him but did not distort anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the physiclan, who had hindsight, and thought it was only a reminder of his trouble, entered, and Miss Aubreys forcing, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees from the back to them, he begged them to delay them, but for one. They, attributing to the folly they imagined, had seized his mind, tried to pacify it and withdrew.\nThe Lord Rutbuen had clenched in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he easily understood himself to be the cause of Jt; but when he appreciated that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened your bosom from his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the presence of great affection for the arid brother's interest in his destiny, which gradually won Miss Aubrey's ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had arid dangers to count—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except to whom he was speaking ;—could say how, sinco he knew her, her existence, had begun to appear worthy of conservation, except that he could listen to horrific soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the serpents art, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the eldest branch fell to him in Iength, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state ), which was to take place on the very day of his departure for the country.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, built in the valley. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held hisjuri their arms as their hope and hope of their house, to delay but for some swarms this marriage, on which he has denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised they to deliver jt; but giving him to the doctor, he better not harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the ravirigs of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with an error that can be easier to conceive than described, the occupied precparation notes. Morning coming, and the sound of the cars broke on his lock. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually fled, leaving Hilri, the guard of a helpless woman. He seizes the opportunity, of which one was related out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was gathered. The Lord Ruthvon was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, with taking arms by force, rushed out of the room, without a voice with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Retain your oath, except it is my bridge in the day by day, your sister if it is dishonored. Women are frail !\" He pushed him to his opponents, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Auhrey could no longer stand himself; his rabies found no ventilation, had broken a vehicle of blood, and he was transported to bed. This wife did not mention his sister, who was rioting when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage has been solemnized, and they married and married loft London.\nEvery weakness has increased; e:\nBlood produces symptoms of a near-death approach. He wanted his sister guardians to be hasty, and, when the midnight drink struck, to be composedly linked to what the reader believed — he immediately decided.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and every sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLDRD BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, let him choose his resting place, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sail through the Greek Arctic, aboard one of His Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of this name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables always have to have there, lead many of your British fels to visit it, both men of war and the merchontmen; and tangb it is rather out of track for the ships linked to Smyrria, its bonuses largely refund for the deviation of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the sacrillier gallanted for oats with the natives, the ecclesiastical and rnyself took a ramble at the cave called Schoal de Homer, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so riamed ), we met a young Greek and we crazyd him as a guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who lofted the island four days before our arrival in his festival. \"He took me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he would have taken me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He is a weird man, a very good man. The cotta ge above the hill, enclosing the river, belongs to him, and he has an old man in charge of just: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six zechines hundred sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he often fails in his felucca to the various islands .\"\nThis story was a great excusation of our curiosity, and we praise no time in the haste at home where our countryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who corried us over the marriage. It is composed of sour apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a silage lounge and a bedroom, with an enclosed space closet. They were all simply decorated: green waltzes, marble tables on each side, a large myrtlo iri, the center, and a small lot of furniture below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed iri spring, the side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa complete the furniture. In the hall of Tbe stood a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty case book: there was no mirror, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the lounge, we only served a marble recreation. Once, the old man said uf, wired with books and papers, which were then in a large trunk of scam in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contents. On the establishment of recreation are Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau complete works; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmorman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the play of Schiller of Robberf; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed at Pclrma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Canstantinople, much torri, but English rio of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian rice and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which the remarks were also made.\nThe man did :\"Tee evil lord read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to trap them with others; but,\" he said ,\" They must lie there until his return; for he is so special, that if I move a thing with orders of love, he would frown on me to serve a week together; he is very good otherwise. I gave him a service, and I made the product of this farm for the pain that she took care of, except twenty zechines that I paid to an engaged Armani who resides in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe operation of the outer house was pleasant. Tobe portico ln front was fifty pieces long arid fourteen wide, and the pillars of marble filled with black plinths and fret work cornices ,( as it is now usual in the Greeian arcbite ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a sine turkey carpet, beneath the clean awning of a strong coarse lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on the learn, the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, driving light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, when we enter the house, a small shroud glissa, grapes, lindens and lindens blazing together its borders, and under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ari ornamental wood back was placed, on the which we were told, the lord passed many of his soothings and nights until dawn, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he was very polite, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday .\"\nThe view of this seat is what can be called \"a view of the board\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, covered with olive trees and blooming blueberries, and to the top of which an ancient Greek temple seemed to be majestic jri rot. A small stream from the rains discovered in broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the montsairi. The smooth sea as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, terminal view in front; and a little to the left, brough avista of loosey chesnut and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had residoded in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name hut Domjnick, his banker, who could go to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could say: \" I am sure he will not do it,\" and can you not say an old friend ?\" I said ,\" If I can,\" he said ,\" I will not dare .\" We did not have time to read the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we the seueral seueral particular of the seigneur isolated. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was walking on the island, and even danced with him at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and a cotton silk surfed to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to poor children. In short, be applauded to us, for all that we have gathered, for having a very energetic and beneficial character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage thought appropriate to reveal. He had a moss daughter-in-law, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imagination all over the rack, guessing who this crawling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of disposion, and he had these eccentricities that mark particulargcnius. Arriving in Palermo, all over the dust disappeared. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been drinking in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in MityIene .\" We had never heard the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our bonds, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our eyes at the cottage, but we consolidated ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will come the return. I render this state of mind, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, arid in justice, the good name of his leadership, which was grossly stoned. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, inverse to associate with human nature, or to contribute to any misfortune to appease his slumbers, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from the anecdotes of the last little. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in the poems of his secretary, seem to raise the seat in his home. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to be attached to his actions; and his wrath for the rest of solitude is in addition a reason 1 to mark him as a being on whose heart, religion has put its seal, and on whose head Benevolene has cast his coat. No narari can read Ibe before the fun \"traits\" feel proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his love or place, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with caution, especially when directed agonizing the moral integrity of man; and he dares to justify himself before the usual tribincll where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest of the contraindications of a virtuous heart and self-collision consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-street.",
    "6": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this talk is just founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant,tal a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually irritated, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the deod rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and terrified. In Well, this is a slight variation, all the regions of Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the belfactory existed, that the vampyres, during the night, soaked in part of the blood of their victims, were emaciated, lost their strength and died quickly from consumption; while these human blood suckers were fattening—and that the veins of Burmese became distended to such a replenishment of the af, in order to shed the blood of all passages of their bodies, and even of the pores themselves of their skin.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, os course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is declared to have taken place in Madreyga, iri Hungary. It appears, in an examination of the commander in chief and magistrate of the place, that about five years earlier, a certain H eyduke, named Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormerized by cl vampyre, but had four ways to get rid of the evil, by staggering the grave of the vampyre, and by rubbing himself with blood. This precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people mocked him for having been tormented, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. For present other mischief, inhabltants being having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as it supposed to be usual cases of iri of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from correction, and emit to the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure and florid blood. The having evidence was therefore obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Poul's heart and body, where he was pushed back to the drool shouted as terribly as if he had a bad baby alive. That is what they did, and they burned his body, and threw the Ephesians into his grave. The same measures were taken with the horns of those who had died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn be 6 of them who survived them.\nThis universal belief is that a person sucked by a camera becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his stomach.\nA judicial officer from the Chief.\nThis monstrous recommendation is related to here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of present than observations any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, this is a kind of punishment after the death, for some ovine crimes committed when they existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but that he has begun to confront his infrnal visilations with these beings that he is loved to last while on the other, those to whom he was bound by kinship and affection.\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corse shall thaw from his tomb; their hauntly the place of origin, and suck tho blood from all thy wreath; there of tby daughter, sister, wife, midnight drain the stream of Iife; yet hate the prohibition that persecutes shall feed thy corse living liuing, thy victims, are yet exhaled, They shall know the devil for their sire; As ye cursed, ye cursed, thy flowers wilt upon the grave. But the one who for the crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shail bless thee with the name of a father — This word will engulf the heart in flame! Yet you must mark the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see Who freezes over they lifolass blue; Then with the hand unshackled shalltcar The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock that Affeetian the dearest pledge has been worn — But now is carried away from your Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood of himself will draw ip; your grinchy tooth, and slip of hook; then hunting at your sulten tomb, Go—and with Govls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the specter reported that they.\nMr. Soulhey also introduced in his wild but benevolent poem of \"Thalaba\", the name Corsica of the Arab servant oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the tomb to the purpose of tormenting hlm that she loved better during existence. But this cannot be supposedly the result of the sinfulness of her life, she wailing has spread throughout the whole tale as the complete type of purity arid innocence. The veraciovs Tournefort gives a long ride in his travel of several amazing ccls of vampyrism, for which he claims to have been an eycwitnefs; and Calmet, iri his great work on his subjoct, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrating their efsects, has pvt forward some dissertations learned, readyriring to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting notices on this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to explanatiori, and which can now be enunciated by simple remarking, that if the term Vampyre is the one in general acceptedation, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrouoolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThere are vampires.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the ottensive dissipations of a London winter, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank, appeared to the various parties. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the laughter of the lawman drew his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into the breasts where modesty reigned. Those who fell this feeling of apprehension could not explain that it arose: some attributed it to the grey tbedead eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to open, and at a glance to pierce through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the hoofs; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of attracting their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of the face, whooh has never gained a warmer hue, either of the blush type of modesty, or fram the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain his attention.\nLady Mercer, who had been the mocker of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and nailed himself but pulsations on the dress of a montebarik, to attract bis notlce :— although in uain :— when fho stood before him, although his cyes were firmly fixed on her, it still seemed that they were uriperceived ;— even his inapplicable impudence was bafsled, and fhe Ift the sield. But tangb the adultrefs common could not influence even the guidance of the eyes of this, there is not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but sucb was an apparent oaution with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent girl wlf, that few knew that he was never addressing himself himself to semales. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and even if it was that he overcame the fear of singularity, or that they were moved by his hatred of the vice, he was often boned among women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vicef.\nAt about the same time, in London there was a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was a person left with a single sister in possession of a great belt, by parents who died while he was still a child. He was also left to himself by the guards, who, however, their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they reliquidated the more important task of his mind to take care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. He had, henee, this romantic feeling is of honor and frankness, which every day ruins many apprentices of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and to say that the vice was cast by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the vestiring of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eyes of the painter by irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that the poet's dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay celebrities, Mcny others surrounded him, trying to erase with the least truth, their long-suffering or blushing favors: the girls at the time of fame, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led her in false riots of his talents and he deserved. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he surprised the walls to find that, except iri the tallow and wax candles that freaked out, not of the presence of a ghost, but of lack of snugging, there was no flea in real life for one of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions ironed out in the volumes of thoso, srom that he had formed his studies. However, by finding a certain vanity of corn ln bis grateful, he was about to sniff his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, trampled him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and very impressive.\nthe ability to form an idea of the character.\nA man completely abhorred in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, ironed hy the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flatters his propensity to extravagant ideas, he folly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the appearance of the hif fantasy, rather than a person before bim. He acquired himself with him, paid him attention, and, until now, advanced to his notice, that his presence was always recognized. He learned graduatedly that Lord Ruthvens affairs were umbarrassed, and found, according to the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to gain some information about this singular character, wbo, until now, had overcame his curiosity, he suggested that this gvardians, that it was time to bim to execute the hur, which for many low generations was deemed necessary to allow the ouring to take fast sorne ftepf in their career vice towclrds putting themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow this cm to appear as if the madness of the fkies, whenever scandalous intriguous are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, acquire to the degree of competence that there is to carry them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately begging Lord Ruthven for his intentions, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who, little by little, had nothing in common with the other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHitherlo, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he found that, although much more of his aclions were exposed to his point of view, the results of the different cred conclusionfjoris fram patterns apparent to the conduct of hls. His cornpanion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to revive their immediate war. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was a riot over the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes which accompanied him even on virtue, which he hesitated to his arms ;— they were sneezes of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he came to ask for something, not to relieve the hjs, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him still into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstantial about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed upon his mind: the whole thing on which it was granted, inevitably proved that there was a curse on him, because they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk down and the most abject misery. At Brossis and in other cities through the quajch, they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion approached all the vices in fashion; they entered into all the spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always gambod with success, except where he knew more sharp was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, so when he enoounled the young rashful navice, or fatber him without luck a great Samily; then he very wlsh the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the bed while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle, he worshipped, cursed, in spite of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him into the roarings of this friend; while many father sat frantically, in the midst of the air speaking of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to fatify their prefent craterrig. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but he immediately lost, to the ruirier of many, then Iast golder, he had just escaped from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this might but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, prevented him from resigning from this charity and plea which proved to ruin everyone, and did not go to his own profit ;— but he dela yod — for every day hehoped his friend would give him an opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthveri in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrcy was near the object of bis curiosity, which did not obtain more gratification of him than the constant excitation of finally wanting to break this mystery, which to bif exalled imagination began to assimilate appearance or something fupernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his companion; he let him attend every day the marning ceremony of an Italian country, crying that he was going in fear of the memorials of another deserted city of Alrnoft. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the greatest waf of his sisler, breathing only from the affécllon; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he were evil, he entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his comparison, they seemed to give him sufficient resonance for belief. His guardians instilled on his immodiately leave his friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, for this possession of refistible powers of seductlon, makes the Bi licentjus habits more dangerous to the focus. It had been discovered that bis conternpt for the adultross had not been born in hatred of his character; but that he had bad need, to strengthen his alfication gr, the victim lhat hif, the partner of his guil, should be precipitated from the pinaole of the non-sulliode virtue, to the low-sulliode virtue, to the low-sulliode virtue, to the low-sl abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those femalos which he had sought, apparently because of the virtue of their, had, since his departure, thrown aside the mask, and had not grated to expel all the deformity of their vices in the public eye.\nAubrey delermined on the leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single bright point on the which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, on average, while, to look at it more closely, arid not to let pass any slight circumstances without attention. He clings in the same circle, and soon peroeived, that his Lordship was encouraging to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he mainly frequented. In Italy, it is rare for a woman who is urimarized to be met in society; which was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but every eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that on the assignment had been supplemented, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent daughter, though insensitive. Without wasting time, he entered Lord Rulhven's apartment, and abruptly asked her for her wishes to respect the lady, inform him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to sneeze him that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would be done on such an occasion; and when asked if he intended to marry him, he simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately shouting a note, to say that from this mother, he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit of Tbeir, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only with regard to the daughter hor, but also with regard to the character of her Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day was a content to attack his servant so as not to stick to a separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interpository.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his sleeps to Greece, and crossed Penlnsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek, and soon took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, shameful for having timed the acts of free men only before slaves, child hid under the sheltering ground or money colored lichen. Under the roof of some like himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to spread ori canvases, the promised hope of faithful time in Mohammed's paradise, except that the eyes were spoke too kind so that someone thought that she might belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plairi, or tripped alorig on the side of the mountain, a world looked up 1 a bad type of its waters b; for who would have exochanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious jeook sleep of the suitable animal but for the blue taste of an epic. Ianthe often ftep light accompanied Aubrey jnhis in search of antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of Kashmere's butterfly, shaw all the beauty of the ber shape, floating as it was on the wind, to linger gazec of him, who forgot the letters that he had deciphered upwards an almost effaceable tablet, in the contemplator of his figure of sylph. Often, trosses fall, as it wilts the oron, expose in the ray of the sun sueb delicately brilliant and fleetingly discoloring the hues, it harms well, excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object which he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing rooms and still balls. While drawing remains of that which he wanted to keep a memory of for his future hours, she stopped, and swept away the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she asked him to dance in circles on the opening, pointed to him in all the brilliant colors of young memory, the marriage pump remembered when he saw his childhood; and then, turning to objects that had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His eo interests and his apparent belies of what is told, excipients the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she recounted the story of the living vampy, which passed badly in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a loyal young girl to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at it by such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had detected in Lasl one living among them, after several of their rallatives and children had been found marked by the lamp of the appetite of the friend; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged to believe it, because he had been pointed out, that those who had dared to question the existence, always had some evidence given, which forced them, with grief, to confess it, it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, his horror increased, by bearing a protty description accvrate of Lord Ruthven; however, he again harassed by persuading her, that there could not be truth in the hard fears. At the same time, he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the fupernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so controversial with all the affected virtues of women that he had sought for this vision of romance, won hels heort; and while ridiculed lheidea from a young mcln of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, slill he found himself increasingly attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian research, he left, decided not to return until her object was reached; but which still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins around the bim, while his mind kept a denage that seemed to be the only righteous possessor of his thoughts. The native disagreed with the love of the hjs, and he was still the same frank child he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could have visited her favorite haunts, that the bear guardian was greedy in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had escaped the destructive band of time. She wrongly appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror to the dwarf itself. Soon after, Aubrey decided to proceed upon one of his excursions, which was of him detairi for a seam of hours; they heard the name of the place, all at the same time begged him nool to come back at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where there would not remain a Greek would euer, swollen the day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the station of the vampyres in the noctumal orgies of her, and denoou put in place the most heavily of evils lingering upwards of the one who dared your oross their path. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his darng so to mock a higher, external power, the very name of which apparently made their free blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for a bis excursion without being appalled; bewas surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned to find that his words, mocking the belief of thofo horrible friends, who inspired them from such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and sincerely prayed Hjm of rolum, ouch night allowed the power of the beings of the place to be pulsed in action ;— he promised. However, he was so ocupiated in his research, that he did not perceive that light-day erid, and that in the horizon, the lerc was the name of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their ragc upon the devoted canister .— He, however, finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; the sun sets, the night begins: it had advanced very far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had an interval of rest — its thick rain heavily forcod itf through the canned foliage, but the 6th forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate to its very sensation. Suddenly, a bis horse got scared, and it was carried with terrible speed through the enlanged forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and he began to four, by the glare of the glare, while he was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust himself to get shelter from the stork. As he approached, the thunder, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible shrioks of a wombln mingling with strings, exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in one of his almost uribroken ;— he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that rolled his head again, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He was in the darkness, very: the sound, however, guided him. It seems that it was not perceived; sor, though called her, still to sound corituated, and no remark of it was taken. He snuck into contact with someone who rose up immediately; when the voice cried out ,\"Always scorned!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sow life as dearly as possible, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and set himself at the vanguard with ardour against the ground :— his enemy fell upon him, and kneeled on bis brcast, had put his hands above his throat — when the glaro of several torches penetrating as he penetrated into the hole that gave light in the day, moved him away ;— be instantly repulsive, and, leaving bisprey, rushed into the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he broke through the water, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they pressed for the one who had attracted him with his cries; he was again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once rnoré burst upon him, to perceive the form of angry from his beautiful conductor brought into the cross without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that was brightening up his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, if he did not close them, scattered on the side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his throat face seemed more attached than the life that once lived there :— on the neck and the blood of the hem of the chest, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein of the tob :— to this men pointed, wept, at the same time weakened themselves with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had been jealous of the object of so many visions of the sling and the fairy, now fallen with a fleur de vie that had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to be moving away, he almost unconsciously took refuge in his hand, a naked dagger of built cell paricular, which had been found in the cabin. They soon met different parts that had been erected in the search of the record that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, they learned the city, warned the parents of some dreadful catostrophs. \"Décrire leur grieving would be impossible; but when they are afraid of the affair of their child, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They are inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to the test was seized of a violent fever most, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthvon and on Ianthe—by some incompetent combinatiori he seemed to be begging for his companionor sormer to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would impretate evil people on his head, and ours will lock him up. Lord Rutven, changed at that time upon arrival in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately put herself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and gripped by the sight of the one whose evil image he now has combined with the heart of a Vainpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, still sworn by the action, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soon reconclamated him to his presence. His seigneury secreted completely changed; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convadescence began to be crooked, ho again gradually connected in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceivod no difference from the old man, excepl that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze filled intensely on him, with the smile of malicious exultaljon playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tideless wave raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the still suri ;— indeed, he hastened to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by a shock of this, was weakened by the mucb, and this elasticity of the mind that had once so dislinguished him now while at the level was fleeing forever. Today he was as in love with solitude and silence as the Lord Arthur; but although he had taken solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Atheris; if he did so in the midst of the vineyards he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; if he turned suddenly, he huddled, with his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile cheek lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each exploiter of which has created such spirit associations. He proposed to Lord Rulhveri, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken during his illness, to visit these parts of Greece and which he had not yet seen. Tobey traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but although they had thus seized from one place to another, they did not seem to consider what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to make a report from Tbesc, whom they imagined to be the invention of the individuals, whose interest was to extract the generality of those whom they defended against the preterids dangers. As a result, neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they traveled wildly a few words, more to serve as their guides as a defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of the which was the bed of a torrent, with large massifs of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they had bad reasons to repent of their negligence; for hardly was the whole of the party engaged in the narrow collar, which they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo report of several guris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves in rocks, had begun to fire in the direction that the report had come. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, irritating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend of defilement: they were humiliated by the being, thus held by an enemy, who, with shovels, the badc avant ce, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers should ascended to the rear and took them to the rear, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They were barely sheltered from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him to the earth. Aubrey hastened to his asphyxiation; and, no longer taking into account the competition or his own peril, was soon surprised by the fact that the faces of the robbers were irritating him, his gourmands having, on Lord Ruthveris wounded, immediately threw down the weapons and rendered him dead.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon Jannducha passed on his wounded friend to a nearby cabiri; being enraged on a ransom, he was no longer destroyed by their priest — they were simply absent to keep the entrance until their command returned with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveris strength decreased rapidly; in two days the information followed, and death seemed advanced with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had of 6 towards him: but towards the end of last night, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, crouched his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with more than usual care —\" Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I do not mean my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you save my honor, your friends hanour. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I need a little bit of my life, I cannot do it, but if you were to give me everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was long unknown, I was in England, but I was there. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweelr !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence ,\" Swear by all your vile dreams, by all your natural fears, if you fear that, for a year and a day, you will not ignore your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eye seemed inflamed with their socks ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He ran down his pillow, laughing, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired to rest, but didn't sleep; many circumstances that saw her acqui....\nHe didn't know why. When he remembered his oath of a cold cleavage waiting for him, he approached something horrible. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the Chamber in the Chamber, he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by bimself arid corridors, at the top of his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promif they had given his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey stunned, and took several times meri, determined to go and bury just on where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he had no body traco or clothes, although the thieves burned, they emphasized the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally remurdered, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the children.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which all apparently conspired to pretend that superstitious mlancholia who had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto, or to Naples, he took care to arrange theosomes he had with him extending to Lord Heaven. Among other things, there is a case where long weapons are the febriles of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the videotime. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. What surprised him to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dag girl discovered in the fatal hut, he shuddered, rushing to get other evidence, he tidyed the weaving, and his horror mcly to be imagined when he discovered that he was equipping, particularly broke, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes began not to need anything else, they sawmod looking to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted your disbelief; but the particle shape, the same varying shades on the shaft and the sheath were black in the splendor on both, and did not leave a place far away; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHo left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were about killing the lady he had tried to seize Lord Ruthvens sedative arts. Her priests are in distress, their patience is ruined, and she had not been heard of the departure of the secretary. The Aubrey spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been victimized by the destrayer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and the only occupation putist by vrugating the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his wall, soan ballotta him on the English coast; and he hastened at the house of the half fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infernitine caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing...\nIt hurts the company.\nMiss Aubrey had only to win thanks to which goes to look and a copy of the assembly of the living room. There was a light brilliance nearly only which exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was devoured by the 1st of the spirit below. There is a melancholy charm about it that seemed to appear unlucky, but the feeling of a sorno inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not that slug foot, which goes astray where a butler or a collar can attract – he was sedate and pensive. When alone, her space was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her afsection, arid would in her presence forget those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that those eyes—that face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been brought into the world. He had been bought by his guardians more appropriate than his presentcliori should be declyed until the return of his brother of the conlirian life, that he could be his protector. So it was now decided that the next drawing-roam, which was fast approaching, should be the epoch of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to reminisce in the mansiori of his hawks, and sinked into the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the most fashionable, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had wilnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, and what had been announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was exceeding: a living room had not been held long, and all those who were impatient with books in the smile of the kingship, rushed to go. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a corner by himself, without taking into account all that was around him, he remembered that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there – he suddenly felt seized by the arrn, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded to his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He hardly had the courage to turn, fearing to see a spocter that blastbim, when he perceived, with a little dislance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He fought until his almost limb refused to bear the weight of Tiger. He was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to let a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was taken home. He passed the room with horrible steps, and fixed his harries on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven ogoin before him — circumstances began in the dreadful picture — the dagger — sanctified .— He blushed himself, who could not believe that it was possible — the dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had averted the image that his mind refuted. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; for he tried to ask about Lord Ruthveri, the name hung up to his lips, and he recovered failed to obtain a computeriori. He went a few nigbls later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a rnatron, he retreated to a reef, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, finally, which many were leaving, he awakened horns, and entering another room, found his thin envelope by several, apparently in serious conversationaliori; he ottempled to pass and approach her, when someone, who he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him the those traits he most abhors. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, in the spirit of the rushed march, forced her to go around the street: at the door, he sounded himself hindered by the crowd of servants waiting for their lord; and while he undertook to pass, he heard again that the voice which whistled him —\"Remember your oath !\"— He dared not turn, but, pressing on from his sister, he soon reached Hame.\nAubrey became distracted almost. If, before, his mind was absorbed by a suffering fact, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the eertainty bones the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attraction was now without hesitation, and it was in vain that she treated him to explain to him what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who terrified him. The more he went astray, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he himself to bring down this monster at Ram, bloody ruining on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been touched by Bim. But even if he harassed his oath, and revealed supplications, who would blame him? He used his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he shoved himself into a glass; locked in his room, he saw one, and he ate only when his sisler came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, no danger is able to carry stillness and loneliness. He is afraid that his house, wandering from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wondered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at 1, he put him to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, who was associated with him for his satisfaction, employed people to follow him; they were soon told by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that Hc left by his colleagues that of his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were uriconscient, he soaked up to enroll again in society, and watched him clonely, anxious to preewarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthvon approaches with instance. But when one entered a room, his bag and his distrustful eyes were so dizzying, his inner shivers were so visible, that his sister was finally oligated to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a sawhood that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene, and fearing that his mind would be alienated, they had a great time regaining the trust that had previously been imposed by our parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent the bimbom from exposing to the general eye, those marks of what they considered to be madness, they forced a doctor to reside in the house, and to take the constant heart of him. He did not object to notice it, if his mind completely is absorbed by a terrible subject. His inoherence finally became so great that he was locked in his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. His eyes had fastened a glass ;— the only sign of the fashion and the remaining memory appeared on the entry of his sister here; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near Hlm if your love for me is great, don't come near Hlm !\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, his answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, he said in a state, from which she could not even roam the hall. This lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year passed, his iricaherences became less frequent, and his mind ripped out a dark part of it, while his guards observed that several times in the day, he was able to count on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians eriteririring his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melanéholy circumconstance of the being of Aubrey in such a horrible situation, when the sister was going to get married. Aubrey's attention was drawn, he impatiently asked whom. Glod lost this mark of the return of the intellect, of which they feared that it had been deprived, they mention the name of the color of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed pleased, surprised them even more by expressing his intention of being present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brace, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once a rnoré alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so diftligued away a row and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which was his surprise at besides the traits of the monstro who had influenced his life so long. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of ragc, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he destroyed the white rose of his future Husbaride, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a frontal expression of face, he told him to swear that she would never marry that monster, for he—but he could not move forward — just seemed as if this voice again asked him to reborn his oalh—he turned abruptly around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but did not see anyone. The guards and the doctor, who had heard the school and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered and sent him away from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees and begged them to delay them, but one day. They attributed this folly to the body possession of his spirit, and tried to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with the every other. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily became irritated to be his cause; but when he suggested that he was regarded as insancuous, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by his attendance, and by the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. What resists his power? His language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the gold earth, except with her whom he addressed ;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, child began to seem worthy of conservation, if just were simply that he could listen to his soothing content ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, which was won by his affections. The bed of the elder branch falling in the back, he obtained a important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed impasse), which was to place the lake the same day he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given help; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the horror of those who now in the grave, who once held their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a sewn that marriage, one who denounced the heaviest curses. His servants promised it, but by giving it to his doctor, it is better not to harass Miss Auhrey's mind anymore by what he considered, the maniac roses. The night passed without regard to the occupied prisoners of the house; and the board of directors of Aubrey, with a horror that can be easier to conceive than described, riots of busy preparation. The morning came, and the carriage sound broke on the big ear. Aubrey grew up almost frantic. In the end, the servants' claries seized their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the study of an old woman helper. He seized the opportunity, with a tie was out of the room, and at a moment was in the apartment where all the workers almost assembled. The Lord Steven was the first to perceive him: he approached immoderately, and, taking his arm in advance, pressed him out of the room, voiceless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\"Render your oath, and know, if my bride is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" To be moved to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in the search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a vessel of blood, and it was passed on to the body. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not the present who he entered, as the physian was feared to stir it. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAubreys weakness has worsened; blood effusiori has produced symptoms of the near death approach. He wanted the guards of his fisher to be called, and when midnight had struck, to be in touch with what the reader had struck, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they stopped, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was quite implored to him, where to choose his place of rest, and Gravence his guide .\"\nEN Sailing through the Greek archipelago Iago, aboard one of the ships of bis Mojesty, in 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, iri, the island of this name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found there, lead many British ships to visit it, both war merchants; and although it is a rather of the trock for the sbips found in Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyago. As usual, at the bottom of the baby, and while the men were used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating with the natives, the ecclesiastical. and I looked at a twig at the cave of the Homer ceiled school, and other poloques, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met the spirit and hired a young Greek as a guide of the dawn, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the arid Greek ,\" would have taken me with him; but I did not choose a quill Mitylenc, where I am likely to get married. He was a strange man, a very good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, helorings lo hiin, and he left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the wine-tr ader, six hundred techniques for her ,( about L 250 Eriglishcurroncy ), and lived there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his selucque very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis story excjted over curiosity a lot, and we lost no hold in the haste at home where our peasant had remained. We were graciously received by a man who led us over the house. It consisted of apartments sour on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet entrance. They simply adorn: walls of green colour, marble tables on the aid of the eitber, a large ge myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which are played through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side tube from a small Venus of bronze in a bent pasture; a large sofa or sofa completes the furnilurc. In the room, there were half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty library: there were no painters, no single painting. The bedroom had nearly a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the common bed soaking in Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old mcln, filled with books of mind and papers, which were then in a large scale of scam in the closet: it was opera, but we did not think nosselvos justified by examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the revised tablet; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, Iri the German Ianguoge; Klopstook Mefsiah; Kolzebues riovels; the game of the Robberf of Scbiller; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, writings with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old husband said ,\" The Lord had read these books 6 before he sapped, and he forgave to place them with others; but, he said, they must hide his return there; for it is so special that if I had moved something without order, he would frown me for a week together; otherwise it is very good. I did him a favor once, and I used this farm for the evil of learning, except twenty zechins which I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the word brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearances of the house of the restaurant were pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marhle canned with black pits and fret work cornices (as is now customary in the Greek architect ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof of Tbe, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a carpet of fir turkey, under an awning of coarse flax strong. Most housotops are shaved with buses, as on them, the Greeks spend their eternity in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small streomelt slipped, grapes, rings and ljmos erro crossing together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bvs of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking lo cheese. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very fervent ,\"Arid has always attended our Twi church this week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe point of view of this seat was what one might call a \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small storm that came out of the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until he was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as glass, and a horizon not shaken by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little orio to the left, through a valley of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wove with spols of emerald greeni. I knew how to appreciate a view before that I did not; but our requests were irrelevant as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone badly to Canada. \"Tobe Armcnian\" said our chief ,\"could say, but I sure he won ,\"and cannot tell you, old friend ?\" I said ,\"If I\" said to be ,\"I don't dare\". We didn't have time to visit the American, but on our return to the city we had several peculiarities of isolation to read. He had shared the young girls right when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, whose dress to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live with these items. He also had a new boat for a fisherman who had raised his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful moss daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the seashore, and which child bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we got rid of the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this ramble in Greece would be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark the peculiar genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who was travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"Individual Thc,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the tenedos theislarid, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we renounce the reclus of Calca on every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious about our courage research, but which has consoled himself with the idea of returning to Mitylerie some future day; but to me the day will never turn. I render this stateman, I sit him without interest, and Iri justice to the good narno of his secretary, which has been grossly slandered. He was described as a dispossession of urifeling, inverse to association with the Burmese nature, or contributing in any way to appease his grief, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, like maybe apparently gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in his seniory poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, the fympclthy, and the health resemble each other to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that gnaws the thing like a being on whose heart, religion has sealed, and on whose head Benevalericehath threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryrnan. While sums up his pleasures, I have the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they affect the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself, that is, the awful court must all appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make the good soret, and avoid the applause of the world, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and approval of self science.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crowbridge, Fleet-Street.",
    "7": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidorl.\nThe position on which this tool is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be Cammon: it laughed, commentcver, extends to the Greeks till after the establishment of Christianity; and it only assumed that it presents form finance the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in the third torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many sumptuous stories, still existing, then is dead from their tombs, and clinging to the 6 moon of young and beautifultho. In the West, it spread, with a few slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there is a belief that the vampyros soaked some of the blood of their victims, who emaciated the bee, lost their strength, and quickly deduced consumption; and that the same welders of human blood, fattened, and their veins were dissolved by such a state of repletion, in order to cause the charge of all passages of their body, and even of the very skin of pores, to flow.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious and, of course, a credible reception of a particular case of vampyrism, which, if declared to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. He seems that at the examination of the commander of the chief and the magistrates of the square, they unanimously affirmed that, with regard to five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been torinente by a vampyre, but had sounded a way to get rid of evil, eating from the soil of the suine of the tomb of the vampyro, and rubbing with the blood hif. This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death, many people complained of being tarnished by him, and of depositing wos, that four people had been deprived of life by his touching. To avoid other malice, the inhabitants having consulted Lejr Hadagni, taken the body, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. After being obtained, they returned to the usual remedy. A pole was completely led through Arnold Paul listening and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of these persori who had previously died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on the others who survived them.\nThe universal lie is that a sucked by vampyre person itself becomes a vampyre, and sucks in its lvm.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject in the present observations than any other example that might be presented. In many countries of Greece, it is considered as a prison sentence after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but compressed to limit his infernol visitatioris sold to those who loved the earth most, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— Asuppositiori allowed to in the \"Giaover\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, your course shall be praised from his tomb; then the ghasty haunts the native placo, and sprinkles the blood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the flow of life; yet, hate the banquet which proforce Must sow your living life Corse, Your victims, have yet come to an end, Know the demori for As cruising you curse them, your flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever for the crime will fall, the youngest, the best beloved of Oll, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will engulf him in flames! Yet, Thau must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the spark of black eye, Aridthe last glassy look must see Who freezes over his lifole blue; Theri with a non-haillow hand will tear The braids of his ycllow hajr, of which, jn lives a lock when thorn the background pledge of Disorder has been worn — But now is carried away by the lhoe Memorial of the agoriy! But with this, his best blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at the tomb, G 0— and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors of Japan depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the corso vampire of the Arab Moids Oneiza, which is represented after having returned from the grave in order to torment him, she loved the best will in existence this. But it cannot be supposed to have reborn from the sinner of her life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The true Tovrnefart giv is a long story in his travels of several oslonizing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of aneodotes, and the illvstrative traditional accounts of its effects, put far some learned dissertations, tending to prove it at 6 th a classical, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on this singularly horrible suprstition could be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of the note, ncessorily devotcd to explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that though the term Vampyro is the one in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Govl, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the middle of the accompanying dissatioris during a London winter, he appeared in various parties of the leader of the anobleman story, more remarkable for its singularities than his rank. He looked at the mirror around Heen, as if he could not participate in Iherein. Apprenticely, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw fear into those breasts where the carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain who she stood up: the sorno attributed her to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance pierced the axis of the heart to the iriward workers; but selling on the cheek with a leaded that weighed on the skin that he could pass not. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were bent to have some thing in their presence eapable to engage their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, whieh never took a warmer hue, neither from the blush of modesty, or the strong emotion of passion, although her frm and outline were beautiful, many women aster notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been mocker to every walrus in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in a hift manner, arid fit al 1 but put on the robe of a molebank, to attract her attention :— although in vain :—where she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently six on her, still it seemed that they were unperceived ;— even her unapplied formudence was flounded, and she left the field. But although common adultery cannot influence even the direction of the eyes of this, the female sex should not be indifferent to him: however, such was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to him. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it is even that he has overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they have been moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, also often among those women who form he boasts of the sex level of their domestic virtues, as among those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, the era came to London, a young man named Aubrey: who was an orphan left with a single sister in possession of a great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by the guards, who thought it was their responsibility to take care of his fate, while they rrlinquished the more important charge of bis rrind to he cared about subaltern mercenary os, he cultivated more his imagination with his argument. He therefore had this romantic impulse of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of an eottage simply corisist in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the planet by irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in line, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. That's why he surrounded himself with many mothers, who were trying to describe the heir who languished or grinch the favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he learned, and by his sparkling cyes, whom he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of talent and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, excepl iri the candles of mowing and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a gbost, hut of lack of snuffing, there was not a foundation in real life for all the bones that congregate pleasant plctures and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Find out how....\nvery, some compensatiari in his gratified vanity, it was absolute to refine his dreams, when the extreme being that we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gave additional signs of his observation of the external objects, that he tacitize to their existence, impelled by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination your image of all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon slept this object in the hero of a romance, and dtormed to observe the spring of his fanny, rather than the person who preceded it. He became familiar with him, paid him attention, said so advanced to his riot, that his pre-senco was always recognized. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon he found the notes of preparation from — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information respects this singular character, which, until now, had only spurned his curiosity, he laughs at his guards, that it was time for him to execute the taur, which for many genres was deemed necessary to enable the young to take a few quick sleps in the career of the vice towards putting thinselvos on equality with the old, and not to allow them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, every time scandalous intrigues are beg the subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear the rn on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking the intentions of his to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a bim a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, but, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, to be happy to accept it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he has found that, although many swears of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions of which apparent motives to his product. His composition was profuse in his liberality ;— the idol, the vagrant, and the beggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wankers. But Aubrey neckld not audio pointing out that he was not raised in the virtuous, redvc to indignation by the accompanying rnisfortunes even on virtue, that he bostoped his alarms ;— this one was sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wall up in his lust, or to sink it even deeper iri bis iniquity, hc was set away from charity ricb. This has been attributed, however, by going to the greatest importance of the vicious, which usually occurs 0 times as the retirement of the virtuous needy. Thore was an orchestratory on the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other loggers, they passed, Aubrcy was surprised at the apparent enormity with which his companion sought the centres of a vice in fashion; there he entered into all the dark spirit of the Faro table: he always yawned with success, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, then he hatched even more than he glinted; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at the Tbc society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a family number just; then his very desire seemed the love of fortune — this abscracy apparrite of the mind was set aside, and his spayed eyes were set aside.\nrkled with more fire than a cat that while diluting with half-deod nausea. In every city, he left the rich yauth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the sato that had fired him withiri the reabb of his friend; while many a father sat frenetic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a singlefarthirig of his delay irnense weath, where with for bvy even sacrifice their present desire. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, in the run of the husband, the last guilder that he had ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this mill got but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which is not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most experienced. They often wanted to present him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit ;—bulb he delayed it — every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; sloppy, it never happened. The Lord Rutbveri in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyes spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratitude than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break the mystery of that, which to his exalted brain imagination to assume the appearance of a somewhat supernalural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a time, lost the sight of his companion; he left him in the daily enthusiasm on the morbid circle of an Italian country, as he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first was from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others were from his guardians, the latter astonishing hjm; if he had before entering into his imagination that there was a feeling of power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immaculate friend and exhorted, that hif choracter was dreodly vicious, so that the possessions of irresistible power of seduction made his licontious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery by far had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had asked, in order to improve satisfaction, that his victim, by the content of his guilt, be cast out of the pinnacle of undefiled virtue, at the beginning to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of the Burmese virtue, child, since his departure, threw the mask aside, and had not rescued to exacerbate all the distortion of their vices to the public circle.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a point of bright single on which to rest the eye. How resolved to invent a little peaceful plausibility for the total abandonment of hjm, purposing, on average, to look carefully at tanning, and not to let pass any slight circumstance. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the Iady daughter, of which he mainly frequented the dung. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; he has been throrefore obliged to continue his years in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all the busy endings, and soon will describe that a resignation had been applied, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though insensitive girl. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartmont, and stubbornly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of fame that he was sighing at her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthuen replied that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have upon such an opportunity; and after being precssed whatever, he intended to marry him, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that time, he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the visit proposed, he ordered his servant to search for other apartments, and to attack the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not directly with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Rutbven the next day simply sent bis servant to natively hif complete dare to separate; but did not suggest any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the Peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself in tracing the cards faded of ancient glory on monuments which seemly shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only by the slaves of ore, had hidden them under the shelter 1 or many colors of which. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, beautiful and delicate, which she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed paradise, except that her eyes were too full of spirit so that one could think that she could belong to those who had no soul. As it was on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have killed the look of a bad type of its beauties; for those who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of nature arimated, for this luxurious look asleep of the suitable animal but to the last of an epic. Slight stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a butterfly collar, showed all the beauty of his sorme, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just dcyphored on an almost effaced tablet, in contemplation of his sylpha-like figure. Often her lresses falling, as she flirted around, exposed in the ray of the sun suob delicately shiny and swifly fading hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very abit it bad before the light of importance to the appropriate irriterprelation of a passage in Pausonias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without drawing rooms and suffocating balls appearing. As he drew the remains which he wished to highlight a memorial for his future hours, she would sneak in and trample on the magic effects of her pencil, plotting the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe the circular dance on the open plain, point him, in all the brilliant acolytes of the youthful memory, to the marriage pump that she thought of looking at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of Hernvres. Her fervour and her apparent bell of what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, wbo had spent years in the midst of her friends, and her most dear ties, forced each year, by attaching to the life of a lady-semale to prolong bls existence during the months that followed, her bload ran cold, while he dared to laugh at these idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of the old men, who had finally detected a living among them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the friends coppetle; and when she so sounded incredulous, she begged to help him, for he had always had a given proaf, which forced him, with a heart-reparing pain, he had always had a given proaf. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, gripped her husband, hearing a fairly precise endowment of Lord Ruthven; however, he persisted on the persuasion of beer, that there was no truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the consequences that all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to mention; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the young woman that he had learned for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he still found glare increasingly attached to the form of all the family before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but to always find impossible to fix the attention bis on the ruins around him, whllst in his mind, he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his branches. Daniel was unconscious of his love, and was still the same frarik child he had first known. She has always had the charge of the form part with the reluctonce; but it is because she no longer has an oon with which she had the chance to visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some fragment which had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and both, with several resentments, affirmed their existence, pale with the same horror name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey dissuaded from proceeding with the sound of his exeursioris, which was to hold the swallow for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him only to come back at night, because he had to necessarily pass through a woo d, where no Greek would ever be remairi, after the day had lost, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their riocturnal orgies, and denounced the most brittle evils as imminent on the hlin who dared to cross their path. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his darng so as to mock a superlor, an iriferal power, whose very name, apparently contained their blood gel, he was silting.\nHe was surprised to observe the richer face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was abovished to talk, Ianthe came beside his horse, and urged him to return, and at night lifted up the power of these eyebrows to be put into action ;— he prostrated himself. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he should not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that in the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly agglutinate in a huge mass, and pour out all their rage upon the devoted land .— He at least, However, riding his horse, discouraged getting up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, it begins; and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunder echoes had scarletly air interval rest — its heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, hishorso got scared, and it was carried with terrible speed through the enchanting forest. The animal finally stopped through the fatigue, and found, by the glabrous lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that removed the dead leaves and the wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a certain order to guide him to the city, or at least to have confidence to get a shelter against the storm. As he objected, the thunders, for the sake of love, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mixed herself with the smile, mocked herself with a laugh, consumed herself in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by a thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was happy...\nThere was no insight, because he had curdled, and the aurids continued, and there was no place for him. He found himself in the contact with some one, which he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out ,\"Always flouted!\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt that he was fighting whose strength seemed to pleaserbuman: determined to sell his life as he dearly could, he fought; but he was in vain: And he fell upon him, and fell upon his breast, and his hands upon his throat, when the dazzling of the torches that entered upon the hole that gave the light of the day, disturbed, and rose up instantly, and left prey, rv struck by the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. And they departed, and the light of their torches fell upon the walls of the mud, and the thatch loaded upon every straw with heavy soft straws. At the fire of Aubrey, they sought her, who was biting with her cries; he was again in darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torch was kindled again upon him, to perpetrate the air from his faltering conductor brought a curse of life. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, that he unlocked the line, extended by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as soothing as the life that one lived in thore :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat, there were marks of teeth that opened the vein :— At this time the men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey waf said next to her who had recently borrowed him the object of so many versions of light and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he was doing, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the holiday, he held in his hand almost a naked dagger of a particle building, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, announced the contents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of the child would be impossible; but that they determined the cause of their child's affair, they looked at the allergy, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were inconsequential, both died in a broken heart.\nWhen Aubrey was put to bed, he had a more broken felter, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven arid on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. Al other shoots, he im precal curses on his pearl, and curses him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately pleased in the house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starred at the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implying a very great repentance for the fault which had caused their separatori, and even more by the attention, the arrangement, and the care which he showed, soon recoricid your presence. His seigneury seemed to have changed; he did not enjoy himself more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Auhroy; but as soon as the convalescence started to ignite, he withdrew again graduated in the same state of mind, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised by mcet bis gaze fixed int tly on him, with asmile de malicius exultation playing on his lips: he knew nat why, but this smile hunlcd him. During the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was engaged in wortching the waves without tides raised by the twilight ooling, or by marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to wish you had the gaze of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had once distinguished him. so so so well, now sown for having fled for never. He was now as lovers of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as one wants madness, his spirit does not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sows him in the midst of the ruins which he frequents badly, the form of Iclnthe stood by his side—is he sought iri the woods, his light step would appear errantamidsl the undergrowth, in the quest of the most violet; then would turn suddenly, show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a smile reborn on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each feature of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to be bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his stay, to visit parts of Greece and not to have seen him. They traveled in each diroclion, and sowed each place for which a recolleetjon could be attached: but though they hadtened so from place your place, but they did not seem to take into account what they looked at. They heard many robbers, but they began to blur these relationships, which they imagined to be only the involvement of individuals, whose interest was to incentivize the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhibitors, once they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as long guides as a defensive. Upon entering, However, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for there were few members of the party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were floating by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by the echo report of safety cannons. Iri, an incident, their guards had left them, and, pushing behind the rocks, had begun to sneak in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example, joined each other for one morning behind the corner of the defjle: but shameful six-year-old thus held by an enemy, who with the irisultant low baye lhcm advance, and being exasperated without resisting sunlight, is one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they have decided both to move forward in the sea of the enemy. Barely lost the shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven took a bullet back into his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer attentive to the contest or to his own peril, he takes hold of him by seeing the faces of the robbers around HLM, his guards having, on Lord Ruthveris wounded, thrown their arrns and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey food encouraged them to transport the wounded friend to a nearby hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which had a fiery one. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased considerably; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of the pain if he had been objects about him: bull towards the end of the last evening, his inirid became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who urged him to offer his help more than usual solicitation —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I watch out for the death of my existence as little as the passing day; but you can save my horror, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I don't know much, my life ebbs apace, I can explain everything, but if you hid all your kriow from me, the honor rny was free to stain in the world's moth, and if my death was unknown for a time from me in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"-\"Swear!\" shout the dying mon, raising himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul resent, by all your fears of nature, swear that for a year and a day you will not imprison your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way whatsoever, what happens or what you can see. \"The eyes of this seemed shaken by their bases :\" I swear !\" said Avbrey; he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the circumstances many attending his knowledge of this man arose the spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he snored the presentiment of something horrible waiting for a bim. The ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hospital in which he had first the corpse, when a thief the mel, and insorbed him that it was no longer there, having been transmitted by the hirnself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the pirinacle of a near mourice, according to a promise which they gave badly to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the trot moon rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the mcn severely, determined to go and bury it where it was. But when he reached the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clots, although the thieves swore that they were reporting the same rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, the mind was stirred up in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he met terrible misfortunes, and in the which all apparently conspired to increase superstitious shot melancholy who had seised himself on his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While he was taking care of a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case that continued to deny the several weapons of offense, more or less adapted to your following the death of the victim. There were several daggers and a teacher. As he killed them, and looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned with the same style as the dagger discouraged in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to obtain further evidence, he turned the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eycians did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but they still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the sheath of half and sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there was also a drop of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna and, on his return to Rome, his first incursions focused on the lady whom he did not attempt to capture Lord Ruthveris sculptural arts. Her parents were in distress, their farune ruined, and she had not been a hero since the departure of her secretary. Aubreys reindeer almost broke under so many repeated stalkers; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of that of It is an artist. He became morose and silent; and only the occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the bone lift one he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, and the chief seemed to obey his will, soon set him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a mummcrit, appeared at also, in the embraes and caresses of his sister, all the remembrance of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her affection, now that the woman began to appear to you, she was even more attached glues a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have a winning goal who won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no one of these light shines which only exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never lit by the lightness of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm that hated him who was not a stage to emerge from misfortune, but from a certain tributary within, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not a light foot, which wandererf was a butter or a color that could attract — it was sedated and perishive. When Olone, her face was never breathing with a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence, those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — the face was then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought by her moro guardians that his presentation should be dislodged until the return of his brother from the aspirant, that he could be his protector. It was now, like ., resolved trot the next show, which was on a fast approach, should be the era of his country in the tbe \"busy scene\". Aubrey preferred that Havo stay in his father's house, and feed on the overcrowded melaricholy with a bim. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been his torn by the uniforms he had hid windnosed; but he decided to thirst for his own comfort. to his sister's protection. They soon arrived in the town, arid prepared sor than a hot doy, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was in excess, a room of drawing had not been held for a long dull, and all those who were anxious to rest in the smile of the kingship hurried there. Aubroy was there with his sister. While he was standing in a corner near Hesolf, without mingling around him, he engulfed in the rem brance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your death .\" He had had a little desire for turn, the fear of seeing a spectrum that would explode it, when he perceives, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this spell from his first entry into society. He looked at Lillirbs almost refusing to carry the weight of a lirb, which was forced to lay the arm of money, and forcing the crowd to passoge through, he shook himself in his car, and was driven hammed. He passed the room with rushed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — the circumstances began in the dreadsul — the dagger — the oath bis .— He awakened him —\nHe himself could believe that he might be able — the dead are still resurrected !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; although he tried to ask the worried Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close raid. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he bound himself in a corner, afraid there engaged in his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when many were leaving, he shaved his back, and entered another room, and found his sister surpassed by many, apparently in a serious conversation; and he tried to pass the training approach to her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed these traits to him, he was most horrified. He went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her to the street; and at the door he took the crowd himself as servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again this voice whispering beside him :\"Remember your oath !\"\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more fully he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again prevailed over his thoughts. His sister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she begged him to explain to him what had caused his abrupt conduct. He only uttered a few words, and these terrified beers. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this moron to gratify, bearing driving on his breath, in the midst of all that he had of gold, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been touched by Bim. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would encroach on his own hand to free the world from evil; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his way, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his beating, to take possession of nature. Finally, unable to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became negative, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humidity. He wasn't a loriger. He recognized him, and returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where the fictigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, deployed people to follow him; but they soon carried away from him who fled a pursuer faster than any — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, of the presence of which they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into the society, and to look at him closely, anxious to the fore-behind, despite his oath, all born Lord Ruthven approaches intimacy. But when he entered into in a room, his colleagues and suspicious appearances were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was the last time forced to beg for him to abstclin srom in search, for her, a society that aspired strongly. When, blindly, the demonstration proved to be unavailed, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated by the bombing, they thought it was very long to resume that trust which had been imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the irjuries and sufferings he had every day contaminated lnbis wandering, and also preventing him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they consider to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was confined to his room. That is where he is lying for days, unable to wake up.  arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid arid  When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her, the only ancestor was :\"Truly! True !\" And again he sank into a fact, from which it was not even though he could roam the bim. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and its mind threw a part of its morosity, while its guards observed, that several times the day he could have put himself on his fin-\nHe has a precise number, then he smiles.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards in his room, Bogari to converse with his doctor on the melancholy oreconstance of the beginning of Aubrey in such a horrible situation, o, when if the sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Avbrey attracted the attendant waf; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, of which they feared that he had been depraved, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country he had met in society, Avbrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't take it, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his smile lovoli; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears of wet mind, flowing to the thought of his brother being more clever to their feelings of affection. He began to talk with all the hls wanted heat, and to anger attest him to his marriage with a perfon so distinguished for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of an inonster who had instilled his life so long. He searched for him in a paroxysm of a circle, and trampled him under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of the future husband. er, he looked as he did not understand her, then seized her hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of face. He told her to swear that she would never marry this moribund, for being — but he could not advariate — it seemed as if that voice made her remember her oalh—he turned abruptly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and yet it was only a return to his disorder, entered, and the forcing of Misf Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, begged, and cried out to delay them, but for a day. They attributed this to the madness that they were jinaginning had plowed the possession of his spirit, overtaken to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the show, and Hod Heen refused all the others. When we heard about Aubrey's health, he stopped right away. But when he found him mad, his exultation and pleasure might be against those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his pagan? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of him solf af of an individual having no sympathy with any heir on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed ;—could know how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not about that he could listen to his stubborn accents ;— well, he knew his how to use the art of the serpent, or this was the will of destiny, that he won his imperfections. The little of the eldest branch falling long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage e ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the criminal.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was he who given him; he wrote a letter to his fisher, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hope and the hope of him, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the most of heavy curses. The servants promised that they would devour him; but giving to the doctor, it is better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. Night passod on without rest to occupied prisoners of home; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can more easily design their described, notes of occupied preparatian. Morriant came, and the noise of the chariots broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants took hold of their intelligence, they gradually seized it, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with an affair was over of the train, and at a moment the fouridhim in the apartmerit where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was madly perverted; he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by the sorcerer, rushed him out of the room, without a voice, with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\" Remember your oath, and if my sling is not today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old lady, had a camo looking for her. Aubrey no longer supported himself; his rage found no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This waf did not mention his sister, who was not present when he enlisted, as the doctor feared to shake him. The death was celebrated, the bride and husband left London.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the close-to-dental approach. He wanted the guards of his sister to be called, and at midnight he struck, he reported what the reader struck, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Avbrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sieve had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where his resting place was shone, and Providence his guide .\"\nOn board the Greek Archipelago, aboard one of the Majesty bis ships, in the year 1812, we place into the port of Mitylene, on the island of this dwarf. The beauty of the place, on the certain supply of cattle and always vegetables to have there, prompts many British ships to visit it — the two men of war on merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the shops linked to Smyrna, they premiums largely refund for the deviation of a voyage. Wc landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the meri were employed to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the nectivas, the clergy. and I took a trip to the ramle called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of the Ida (an upland small)\nCule so named) we met and hired a Greek word as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He came to me like a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\" and he took me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am likely to marry .\" He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, making the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not sincerely; so he sails in his felucca very often to the various islands .\"\nThis story exacerbated our curiosity very much, afraid we lost no time in a haste at home where the very countryman had resided. We were delighted by an old man who covered us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: light green walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fortune under, whooh could be made to play your game through the branches by moving the spring cl fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a posture of learning; a large sofa or sofa completed the surniture. In the hall, slood a half dozen English cane chairs, and a library company: there was no mirrorf, rior cell unique painting. The hodchambre had only a large carpet plait spread on the floor, with two bottles of stuffed cotton and a pillow – the common bed in all Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified to examine the content. On the recess tablet are Voltaires, Sbakspearef, B0ileaus, and Rovsseau's work complete; VoIney Ruiris os Empires; Ziminerman, in German; Klopslock's Messiah; Kolzebues novels; Schiller's plcly of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, anItaliani cditlan, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets in the Greek press in Constantinople, torn mucb ,6 th no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribulated all the way, and my work with paper underwear, of which were also remarks.\nThe old man of Tbe said :\"Tobe lord had read these books before he sailed, arid forgot to place them with others; bvt,\" he said ,\" They must lie until his return; for he is so porticular, that if I moved nothing without order, he would frown me for a week together; he is always very good. One day, I did him a favor; I had the gift of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty-two Chinas that I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and that the first girl here from Adrianople; I do not know for which reason .\"\nThe appearance of the outside house was playing. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greenclans architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, with a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, on which the Greeks spend their evenings in cooking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma cbristi\", eating fruit, and enjoying evening hroeze.\nOn the left strip, as we encumbered the bush, a stroamlet glided away, the grapes, oranges and lime gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bush blues, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the word spent many of his cellri gs and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to bimself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very crazy, that he had always left our church twice a week, because Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what we could call \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrlle treks in the flower, and on the top of which is an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream slit the ruins in broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, arid a borizon not eclipsed by a cloud of fins, tormjnat the view in front; and a little on the left tip, through a virtual of high and palin-trees chesriut, several small islarides carried distinctly observed, sparing the light blue wave with emerald green af spots. I liked a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his dwarf but Domirilck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\" could say it, but I am furious, he will not say it,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I won't dare .\" We had not long visited the Armenian, but on our return to the tower, we would bend several parliculars of the secluded lord. He shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with that popular feast. He put a cow to a man, hares to others, cotton and silk to the girls who live with these artists. He also bought a new book for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he seemed to us, from all that we co-elected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance comes to us, which our old friend at the cottage bought cleanly so as not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a plano-fortus, and had taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations everything on the rack, guessing who this ramhler in Greece could back. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of deposition, and all the close eccentricities that mark the peeuliar genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the archic, a student of WYATTLES, who had been a traveller in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also saw him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from the house; cabin \"Child Harolde\" being put in our hands which recognized the recogriized by Calcla on each page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious about our research with the cottage, but we consulted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of her secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been portrayed as an unshakeable provision, contrary to associating with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add his pleasures. The fact is the opposite, as can be seen in these ancestors. All the finest feeling of the heart, so praisefully portrays the poems of his secretary, seems to have the most seat in his bosom. Tenacity, sympathy and charity seem to guide the actions of Oll Jobs; and his wrath of loneliness is an additional reason to scam him as a being upon which the Religion sealed his heart, and upon whose head, the Volunteer threw his coat. No man can read the \"characteristics\" of playing until he feels proud of himself as a castingman. As far as his love or pleasure are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with caution, especially when directed against the moral integrity of man; and he dares juftify life before the evil tribal where all must appear, only can censor the errors of another-morl. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. For good in the dryrel, and to escape the applause of the world, is the furious testimony of a virtuous and self-proveing connaque.\nTHE END!\nGilelet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleot Street.",
    "8": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe fumestition point that this story is found is very general to the East. Among the Arabs, it seems common: it did not, however, extend itself to the Greeks until asterizing the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it gradually acreafod, arid formed the subject to many narcotic looks, still in progress, of the death rising of their tomb, and to feed on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, ail ovor Hungary, Polet, Austrla, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres soaked at night some of the bl ood of their victims, who became camaciated, lost their strength, arid quickly died of oansumtions; while these human blood suckersfclttenod — and their veins became distend to such a slate of repletion, so that the blood flow from all passages of their body, and even vecrypores of their skins.\nIri, the London Journal, of Mclrch ,1732, is a curious report, and, of course, credible if a particular case of vampyrism, which is frozen for having taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the masters in place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard that in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth out of the tomb of the Vompyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, arid a repository was made, that the four person had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove even more inside, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as is plentiful to be usual, iri vampyrism coffees) stress, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid charge. As the evidence was obtained, he resorted to the usual remedy. A logger was all through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is a reporter for shouting as if he had been delivered. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the glasses into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of people who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre herself, and sucks on his TV.\nA judicial officer.\nThis tade rodomon monostrous is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a sort of punctuation after death, for a heinous crime committed that exists, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to confijne his infernal visits only to those whom he loved most while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by these of arid affection .— A fupposition alludes to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from her tomb; then, haunting the place of origin, and sucking the blood of thy seed; from thence, the daughter, the sister, the woman, about midnight drain the stream of life; Yel hates the haunch that performeth thy living corsus, thy victims, They will still expire, and they will know the devil to be His sire; as thou cursest him, thy flowers wilt on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the greatest beloved of all, Shail blesses you with the name of a father — Word of thal shall envelop your heart in flame! Yet, you have put an end to your task and marked the last tiring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see Who freezes his blue without life; Then with the tear of the hand without Halloween. The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the thorn, the tenderest place of affection has been worn — But now is corned by the memorial of the thiary agony! Yel with your own best blood will flow; by grinning tooth, and aching-\nGo-and with the ravines of Gouls and Faults, until those in horror distance themselves from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful peein of \"Tbalaba\", the corse player of the Arabic mclid Orieiza, who is represented as having turned from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him. She is the most loved person during her life. But this woman must not be supposed to have resulted from the success of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and ineriocence. The true Taurnasort gives a long count in his lraves of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in hjsgreen work upon this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put far some learning dissertations, tending to prove that it is olassic, as well as barbarial error.\nMany crunchy and interesting naties on the singularly horrible superstition might be added; although the present may suffice for the lirnits of a note, necossorially devoted to explanatian, and which can now be coricomposed by merely pointing out that the term Vampyre is that in foam general acceptance, here are feverish other synonyms with it, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Gul, BrovcoIka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe would strike that, in the midst of the dissipations attacking over a winter of Loridon, a noblemon appeared to the various parties of the ton leaders, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his attenlion, that he migrated by a glance, calming him, and throws fear into those breasts where the unconscious reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain when it arose: some the attitude with the dead grey eye, which, staring at the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, at a glance, through your heart's inner work; bvl failed on the cheek with a ray lead that wigbed on the skin it could not pass. His peculia laughs made him be invited to each house; they wanted to see it, and those who had been subjected to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly dizziness of her face, which never climbed a warmer hue, neither frowned the bluffh of modesty, or the strong emotion of passiori, although her shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after natoriate tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some wbat ranks that they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of all the Shewri monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, the horse hair on the way, and made al-I put on the dress of a mauntebarik, to attract her attention :— although in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apprivoly fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived ;—everi her impudenc inappalled was stooped, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidance of his boss, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning trip; and if it was that he even overcame the road of his singular character, or that they mocked his oppressor hatred ostensibly vice, he was as osten among those women who boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, he came to London, a gentleman who was named Avbrey: he was an orphari left with cln only sister in the possession of grandfather, by parenls who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by guardians, who thought that it was just necessary to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind in the ear of the subalterns mercenary, he cultivated more his human imagination in his judgmont. He had, Herice, a high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins so many apprentices of thousands. They retrieved everything to sympathize with nature, and thought that the vice was lhrowri by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misory of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was handsomo, frank, and rich: these reasons, at the time he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, struggling who should describe the least truth their languishing or farfelu favorite: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he was burning, and by their sporkling eyes, that he opened his lips, soon led him into notions falsifying his talents and his merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there had not been foundation in real life. for none of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, The storm that he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, who was about to return to his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it, and the very impossibility of forming a idea of character of cl man entirely absorbed iri hiinself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avidance of the contact mind: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to exdravaganl ideas, he soon fermod this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to hide the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He got together with him, paid attention to him, tied up so far in advance, that his presence was recognized from the slides. He learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from the preparation riots in — Stroet, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had deliberately sharpened his curiosity, he bathed at his guardians, that it was late for him to persevere in the tour, which for many generations has been deemed necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps to improve themselves on equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear so fallen from the sky, whenever fcandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or prayer, agree to the degree of competence he had to carry them on. They agreed; and Aubroy, speaking of his intentions to Lord Robert, was surprised to receive a proposal from him to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the other mind, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circle of galleys.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he has found that, although much more hif actions were exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions of the movies apparent to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his freedom ;— the idle, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from the hand bis more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to iridence by the misfortunes even sitting on virluus, that he gave his alms ;— these were sent to simmer the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligato came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him slill deoper in bis iniquities, he was sent with rich charlty. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which generally prejudged the retreat because of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance abhorring the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the 1 o west and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the shaded cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent impatience he had towards his companion for his vice in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable fact, with which he usually dragged this sciety around: he was not, however, so when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without the air of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes sparked with the more fire only if the cat dilated with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes of the silent hungry children, revealed himself a single distant from his late immonistic wealth, where with even buying enough to satisfy their present desire. However, he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the runners of many, last guilder then he had justnatched the convulsive take of the innocent: this could but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of counselling thecunning of the experience more. Aubrey often wanted to present him to his friend, and begged him to resign that purity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring him to his own profit ;— but he delayed just — for the day when he hoped his friend would give him an opportunity to speak from only and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthveniri's car, and in the midst of various wild scenes and lleh of narration, was always the sclme: bis oeil spoke less than his lip; and although Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, to be obtained no grelor gratuitislcation from him than the excitation convoking vainly desire to crush this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a last time, saw his companion; he left him in daily attendance up the morning circle of an Italian country, as he wept in search of the menorlaux of the almost deserted city rather. He was thus engaged, letters came from England, he exhaled with impatience; his sister's first waf, breathing only from affection; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in the companion bis, lefo seemed to give them a specific reason for belief. His guardians instilled on his immediate departure from his friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, because the passion for irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. He had been discouraged, that his contempt for adultery had been caused by a riot in the hatred of his character; but that hc hod demanded, for enhaneo hif gratlfification, that his victory, the associate of his guilt, should be precipitated from the pinacle bone unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the femas that he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, finco his displeasure, pulpered even the mask, and had not led to denounce all the deformity of their vices to the public circle.\nAubrey determined on leaving one, of which the bad past Yel characler showed a single luminous pear on which the eye rests. It resolved lo invents plausible somc prelext for handling hjm quite, purposing, in the wbile meon, to look more closedcly, and to let na light connections go through unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his secretary was tending to work on the inexpireee of the lady's daughter whose house was mainly frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; therefore be obliged to listen to her plans in secret; but Aubreys eyo followed him in all his windings, and quickly discovered that an assignment on had been corrected, which would end the most likely in the ruin of a tennis, although a girl without thought. Losing his time of rio, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, abruptly asked her his intentions with respect to the lady, insorring him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet his shot the same night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such as he all thought had on such an occasion; and over six years in a hurry that he sought to marry him, he simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a riot, to say that from that time, he had to refuse to take over his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informed out of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The assignment was pre-verified. Lord Ruthven sent his servant to notify you of his complete consent to a separation; but do not doubt his plans having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, soori found himself in Athens. Ho Tben fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and the son took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, were ashamed to tell the acts of free men only before the slave, had hidden them under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same razor as he, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that he could have formed fashion 1 to serve a painter desiring to pour on canvas the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she might be among those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or truffled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazele, a type of power of its beauties; for those who would have excavated his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature. for this luxurious look, the sleep of the animal adapted but to the tasto of an epicuro. The slight scarf of Ianthc Osten accompanied Aubrey in his search for onquiities, and often the dishonest girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere utterfly, would show the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind to stare at her avidly, but forgot the letters he had just decrypted on a table almost erased, in the contemplation of her sylph figure. Osten would drop her braids, while she was writing, displayed in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, she could well exercise the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from her inside the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try describe the symbols that all feel, but none can appreciate ?— He was innocent, youthful, and beautiful, even affected by bond-drawing rooms and choking the balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to preserve the memorial for his future, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of the bis pencil, tracing the scenes of his native place; she would then describe him circing danee on the open plain, painted, to him in all the glamorous colors of youthful memory, he docked pop sho remembered having seen in his childhood; and then, turing your subjects that bad ovently made a groater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. And often as she told him the story of the living vampyre, which he had spent years in the midst of his family, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, feeding on the life of a washed female to prolong his existence for the following months, his blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh out of idle sucb and horrihle santasis; but Ianthe quoted him The names of the old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of their loved ones released and children had been found marked with the buffer of his appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe it, for it had been noticed that those who had dared to question their existence, always had a given proof, which forced the ind, with sorrow and heartbreak, to confess it was true. Sho detailed to him the traditional appearance of the monsters, and his horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; he, however, still perfided by persuading her, there would not be true in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had tended to excite a belief in the natural pilgrim power of Lord Arthur.\nAubrey began to linger more and more to mention his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected victims.\nHe laughed at the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still found himself more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. At times he was tearing himself from her, arid, bewitching an antiquarian witch research plan, he went away, decided not to return to his object was reached; but he always found impossible at six of his attention to the ruins around him, while his mind kept an image that seemed to allow the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. The Clinton was unconscious of his love, and was always the same childish Francoist binge he knew first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favourite haunls, that her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a white fragment had escaped the time of the destructive hand. She had applied to her parents on the vampires subject, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold HLM for a few hours; when he heard the place once or then, he all begged one of him not to come back at night, because he had to necessarily break a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as an imminent purpose, the one who clinged to cross the Jr road. Aubrey inade light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; bul when he shuddered them to his audacity so as to mock himself with a superior power, iridiferal, to the same name as what lent their frozen blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey osfed on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that the words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had infused them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the faithfulness of his horse, and he earnestly begged him to remember it. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not realize that the light of the day was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those toads who, in the climates of war, rushed so quickly into a huge mass, and poured out all their rage upwards of the country devoured .— He, however, finally ascended his horde, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fetes, the night begins: and care it had advanced far. The power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely a resting interval — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the eanopyant falching, while the forked blue lightning sowed to fall and radiate to its very sight. Suddenly, the horfo became afraid, and it was carried with a sharp dreadful through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the blade of lightning, that it was in the table quarter of a hovel that hordly lifted himself from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that was surrouding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city of Tbe, or to get away from the storm to get it. As he approached, the Lunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a smitten woman with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in the almost uninterrupted manner ;— he went on; but, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the mourning of the hut. He found him in the darkness; but the sound guided him. Apparently, he was not received; for, though he dared, the sounds continued, and no notice was taken from him. He found that he no longer heard any talk with anyone, that he had seized a force that seemed superhuman to him: determined to sell his life as expensive as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw a huge force against the ground: his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled his breast, laid his hands on his throat — when the glorification of many torches entered the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him; he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the bronches, while he was breaking in the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there; and Aubrey, incoherent in the moving, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered; the height of their torohes fell on the mud walls, and the torch began to sow on the undivided straw with heavy soft flakes. To Aubrey's desire, they would hold on to her, who would have attracted her with strange shouts; he again left himself in the darkness; bvl what was her horror, when the light of the torohes flashed to her once again, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor burned in a corso without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vibe from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, which he did not close, strangled by his side. There was no eolour on his cheek, even riots on his lip; yes, there was a silence on the bear face that seemed almost as endearing as the lily that once lived there :—upori his arid breast neck was blood, and on his throat out were the marks of the teeth that opened the vein :— to this men pointed, crying, simultaneously suffocated of borbor ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A lilter was quickly sown, the clrid Aubrey was bewitched by the slde of his wife had recently been he obie tube and so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He knew that not what his pensions were—his mind was randomized and seemed to run away from roflect, and take refuge on vacation — he held unconsciously iri hand a nakcd dagger from a particular construction, which had been found in the hvt. They were soon welcomed by different parties that had been engaged in the search of her that a mother had missed. Their lainentical wept, as they approached the city, announced the principles of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe that the child's death was impossible, but when she showed the cause of the child's death, he looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were inconsolable; a bobb died in broken support.\nAubrey being put in the water had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; at these intervals he could have appealed to Lord Ruthuen and Iantbe — by an inexplicable combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses in his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthuen, had the opportunity at this point to arrive from Athens, and from what reason even, on the support of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant attendant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whose image he now had with that of a Vainpyre; but Lard Rulhueri, by kind words, employing almost rrperitance for the fact that had oaufed their separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled to the presence bis. His seigneury seemed astonished; it did not appear that the apathetic bcing which had so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, to gradually retired irito again the same state of mind, and Avbrey perceived no difference from the old mcln, except that sometimes he was surprised to incl his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not regret why, but this smile shone him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of the lhose orbs,circling, like our world, the still suri ;— indeed, he seemed to have with to avoid the eyes of all.\nYour mind, by this eyebrow, was greatly weakened, the arid elasticity of the breath that had once so disstancized him now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of social and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought in the midst of the ruins who had been trainedly frequented, Anthony forin stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quesl of the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, how, with his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, all of which have created such assailed in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rutbven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his misfortunes, they had to visit the parts of Greece, and they had not yet seen him. They went in all directions, and searched for all the places where a memory could linger; but although they hadtened to set up, they did not seem to hold what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to look at these reports, which they imagined to be on the investigation of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from so-called dangers. As a result of negotiating the advice of the inhabltants, they traveled once with only a few guards, more to serve as guides as defense. However, at the time of the formation of a narrow dew, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks brought down neigbbourant precipices, they had reason to repent of their intelligence; for it was horrificly the whole of the TB party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near the head to befall, and by the echo ratio of several cannons. In a third, inserting the guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the same report. Lord Ruthvon and Aubrey, imitating the example of the Tor, demanded behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but grieved to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, moved them forward, and to be exposed to slaughter without violence, if one of the robbers had to climb up and overturn them in the back, they decided 0° to rush in search of the cnome. As soon as they had lost shelter from the rock, Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which led him to the impound. Aubrey hastened to be besieged; and, no longer taking into account his own profile, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his having guards, on Lord Ruthvens detour, immediately threw away his arms and furs.\nBy promises of great reward, Avbrey soan encouraged them to put his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after hanging on to a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are content only with guarding the entrance until their comrade comes back with the promised sum, far away from where he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days, arid death followed, death seemed advancirous with hasty steps. His conduct and his approach had not changed; he saw as an unconscious of pain as he had been objocts about him; but towards the end of the last evening, the bis spirit became apparently uncomfortable, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced to offer his help with plus than ordinary serious — assist me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean iny life. I listened to the death of my existence as little as the inclt of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do something earlier ,\" Aubrey replied. \"I made a little noise, I cannot explain everything, but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was clear in the mouth of the world, and if my death had long been unknown to England —I— but life. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying girl, raising HLMSE 1 f with a strong vigour ,\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature, that for one arid year a day you will not give your know-how of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, which can happen, or what you can see. \" His eyes seemed inflamed with their slippers ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He ran down and laughed at his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge with the man arose on the hif mind, and it was not known why; when he was taken up with his goal, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the present, something horrible was waiting for him. When a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer the theory, Hovirig was transported by himself and his comrades, at his retirement, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise he had made to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took several of the men, determined to go and bury him at the place where he was. But when he moved to the top, he found a trace of the body's clothes or ortho, although the thieves swore that they had reported the identical rock on which they had misposed the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally reopened, convinced that they had buried the corpse because of the clothes.\nWeary of a country that he had met with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to absolute this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resisted leaving it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship at Coriuey Hiin in Olranto, or in Naples, he was organizing these effects with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing febrile weapons of offence, more or more places adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers and attacks. While turning them back, excluding the curious forms, what was his surprise to sin a coat apparently adorned in the style sarne as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get further evidence, he found the weapon, and horror can be imagined when he discovered that he mounted, although particularly shaped, tho sheath he held his heel. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at back bound to the dagger; yes again he wanted to disbelief; but the particular shape, the same varying shades on the shaft and sheath were oexil in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his whole homo, in Rome, but first investigations were about the lady of Tbe whom he had attached to the snatch of the seductive arts of Lord Ruthuen. Her parents were in distress, the job failure ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. The bee of the Aubreys spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this Iady would have a victim at the Ianthe destroyr. He became inorose and silent; and his only occupation was built up by exhorting speed beyond the postings, as if he were going to save the lily of someone he held asleep. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soori called him on the shores of the English; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, arid there for a Millel, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached to an operation.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winning grace that won the gauze and applause from the salon assemblies. There was no of this slight hemorrhage that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was always illuminated by the quality of the mind below. There was a melancholy charm about him, which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but snored a feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which went astray where a butter or aour might be attributing – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed in his affection, and forgel in his presence, these sorrows which knew sanitized his rest, which had exchanged the smile hor for thouoluptuary that? It seemed that these eyes, the face of the shot, played in the legion of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and not been introduced to the world, having thought more by his guardians that his presentation should be delayed until the return of his table bra countering, when he could be his protector. It was now decided that the next show, which was approaching, should be the era of the beer entry in the \"busy fence\". Aub Grey would have preferred to remain in the home of his fathers, on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not take an interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit had been torn apart by the eternity of which he had witnessed; but was determined to sacrifice his own spouse to the protections of his sister. They soon arrived in the city of Rii, and prepared for the day post, which had been announced as a salon.\nThis crowd was excessive — a living room had not been welded in a long time, and all the toilets were anxious to rest in the semi-bone royalty, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was sneaking alone in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, he undertook to remember that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded like ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fear of seeing a spectre would explode, when he perceived, at a certain distance, the same figure that had drawn his nazi to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs were almost refusing to beat their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and forcing a collapse into the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He grabs the room with pressed steps, stares at his strips on his head, as if he had already had his thoughts burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances dried up in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He mocked himself, he could not believe that this was possible — death rose again !— He thought his evil imagination was conjuring the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; although he intended to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung up his lips, and he had no opportunity to win the information. He went a few nights later with his sister, the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he removed the joint for a break, and there he gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he woke up and entered another room, found the sister has surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to die, turned around, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took hold of his arm, and hastily forced it to the slug; and at the door of Tobe he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing over them, he heard again the voice of that whispering beside him ,«Remember your oath !\" He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, he soon picked up his house.\nThe Aubrey brain almost got distracted. Is before his mind absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that certainly of the living monster again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she instructed her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, arid those who terrified him. The inority he gagged, the inority was perplexed. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this biter to wander, bear ruining on his b roalh, in the midst of all that he loved, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would deploy his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had been derisory. For days, he remarried in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his fist came, which, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he was no longer able to carry the still and loneliness, and left his house, wandering from the street to the street, anxious, stealing this image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the sun of the Monday as midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; he finally threw him at dawn, the rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his family, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled faster than any pursuer, in the same way. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his obsence to all his friends, with a friend amongst them, of the presence of which they were ruthless, he decided to enter again into society, irito, and to watch him close early, anxious in advance, despite his hearing, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his hamburger and his distrustful look were so striking, the inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from looking for a sockety for his favor that touched him so strongly. However, when the remorstranee stopped, the guards thought it was good to interfere, and, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they thought it was very important to regain that trust that Australian parents had previously imposed on them.\nDesirous bones erasing him from the wounds afflicting the suffering he had daily encountered in his wandorings, and to prevent Birn from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be hay, they instructed a doctor to reside in the house, and to take constant care of them. Hc hardly seemed to notice, so that completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he confined himself to his room. He is often able to wake up for a few days. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a brilliant 1st time ;— the only sign of affection and memory remaining appeared upon the entrance of the hair sister; then he began sometimes, and, by licking his hands, with eyes that severely affected him, he could have decided not to touch him. \"Ob, don touch him; if your wing for me is great, don't harass him !\" When, above, she asked who he was talking to, her only answers ,\"Truly! True !\" And he hit himself in a state, from which he couldn't even roll it. This lasted a lot of months: gradual, however, as the year was passing, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and his mind threw off a part of them glooin, whlst his gardensobserved,thal several times iri. the day he counted on his fingers, a defined number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubreys situation, while his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately attracted; he anxiously asked whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, whose they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking of a young country whom we had met in society, Aubrey felt happy, and amazed even more by his intention to express himself to the nupils, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister inspired him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to the chest hands, and kissed his cheek, wet grims, flowing to the thought of the being of his brother orrice more alive the feelings of affection. He began to speak with his wond hearlh, on to congratulate him on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and each employee; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, which is his surprise to see the features of the monster that so long badly influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramples it under the idiot. On her asked him why he thus destroyed the tbercs emblem of his future crow, he looked as he did not hear it — then by grabbing his hands, looking at beer with a frantic excrescence of face, he made him swear that she would never marry that assembler, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice reminded him of his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guard and the doctor, who had kept everything, and thought it was only the return of her disorder, entered, and Miss Aubreys, which wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees, implored them to the delay, but for one day. They, attributing this madness which they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, advanced to pacisy him, and retired.\nLord Ruthen had called in the morning after the drawing room, and had been refused with all the others. When heard of Aubrey's evil hope, and understood himself willingly to be the cause of him; but when he bound up with him, he did not know what he was doing.\nIndeed, he was considered to be a license, his exultation and his pleasure could hardly be conceoled from those whom he had spoiled this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, through constant attendance, and the claim of a great effect on brotherhood and interest in his destiny, which gradually won Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to count—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the mad earth, except with her to whom he added ressed himself ;—or could say how, as he knew her, his existence, hadbeguri to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accesses ;— in line, he knew so well how to vex the art of ferpent, or such was the afate will, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch falling at length to hjm, he obsessed a large embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage ,( in the craving of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continuous.\nAbbrecy, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, erasing him, as she appreciated his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grove, who held him in their arms as the arid hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised they to deliver him; bul giving him the doctor, he thought he no longer harassed Miss Aubreys spirit by, who he comforted, be ravagings of maniac. Night spent without real to the busy members of the house; and Aubreyheard, with a horror that much more easily be designed than described, occupied preparation notes. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke his ear. Aubrey grew up almost the frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custadus of an old woman without shame. He seized the opportunity, with a bath was the soul of the room, and in a front was found in the bearing where all were gathered. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, found, talking his arms by force, a bim pressed from the room, fury without a voice. Wheri on the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered to Iri his ear —\" Remember your oath, arid knaw, except for my fiancée on a day-to-day basis, your sister is dishonored. The horneri bow is frail !\" His saying, he pushed him to the servants of his, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; the riot of arrogance discovered vengeance, had broken a blood vessel, and they carried him to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not pregnant when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was sold, the bride waved and the husband left London.\nEvery weakness is increasing; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He desired the custody of his sister, and when the hour of the night rang, he reported in a composite way that the speaker had perpetuated, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was above all, where to choose the resting place of the business, and Providence its guide .\"\nEN Sailing through the Archpclago of the Recien G, aboard one of the ships of Her Majesty, in the year 1812, we put in the bravery of Milylene, on the island of this name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, lead many British vessels to visit it — both warren and merchants; arid though it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed at the galley, and the stock exchange negotiated for the cattle with the ncllives, the cergymclnarid myself took a ramble in the cave called Home School, arid other places, where we had seen 6 before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and erected a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with a Lord English, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and took me with him; but I made a riol choose your leaving Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good Korean. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he forgave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided in his felvcca very often at the different islands .\"\nThis account excited us very much, and we did not lose any time in the haste in the house where our peasant had resided. We were graciously rewarded by a man, who led us to the mission. It is composed of sour apartments on the entrance hall, grourid-foot —ari, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a stunning clofe attached. They were decorated with a sirnply: plairi green-stained wails, tables ori marble on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small oven underneath, which could be made for play through the branch by moving a spring fixed on the side of a single hronze Venus in a lean pocket; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall, we held thals called dozens of English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor one painting. The 6th bedroom can only be a large mattress on the flower, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, a common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a recss of marble, sorinerly, the old man told us, filled with books and popers, who were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think that our jackets were justified by examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltclire, Shakespeare, BoiIeau, and Rousseau the complete works; the Ruins of Volney os Empires; Zimmerman, in German language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the Nouels of Kotzebue; the plcly os thc Robhers of Schjller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several brochures of smclll of the Greek press in Conslantinople, many native, but no English book of any dot. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The English was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with paper briefs, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The first had read books of these in the evening before he sailed, he forgot to place them with others; but ,\" he said ,\" he must lie until his return; for he is so special that I have been to move a thing without order, he would sling on me for a week together; otherwise be very good. I did him a favor once, and I made the product of this farm for the trouble to take care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought care of Adrianople; I do not know why the reason .\"\nThe external appearance of the house was pleasant. The first partico was five steps long and fourteen broad, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, overwhelmed by a light story bullstrade, was covered with a turkey carpet flanked under a strong coarse linen awning. Most housetops are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wlries, such as \"laohryma christi\", the fruits that graze, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hand of lefl when we entered the house, a small strcamlet guided away, grapes, oranges and lime were grouped together on its borders, and under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with ari arnamental wooderi dos was placed, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"The idea,\" said the old man ,\" was praying, because he was very fervent, and he always attended our church, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seal was what can be called \"a bird view\". A liria of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, a cave of olives and myrt trees in bloom, hung on the top of old white. The Greek temple was similar to the majestic decay of the iri. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as glass, and the horizon is urishadod by a cloud slanggle, Finish the view in front; and a little to the left, through the cl vista of noble hazelnuts and polm-trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unanswered as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: norie knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our doctor ,\"could say it, but I sure he said nal ,\"—\"And cannot say, old fried-\n\"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare riot .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we left some details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was the last woman on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to the old man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these things. Also, I bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek tests to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, according to all we collected, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circle instance we learn, that our old friend to the cottage although proper not to reveal. He raised a very beautiful girl, with whom the Lord was seen on foot on the sea, and he had bought her a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; your imaginativesall on the rac k, guessing who this creeping in Greece or being. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arrived at Palermo, the doubts of the dawn were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr . FDSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual ,\" he said ,\"about whom you are his anxiovs, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travers ontho est 1 and Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the truer of Calcla on every page. Did we not regret not being curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc ori on a future day; but inside that day we will never return. I make this statement, I think it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court at the right name of its worship, which has been grassy clumsy. It has been described as a disposition of sensation, on the contrary, if one associates human nature, or if one wants to appease his pains, or add to his plaidsuros. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered at these little anecdotes. All the more sinister feelings of his heart, so elegantly represented in his seigneury poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The Tend-\nRnosis, sympathy, and cabality seem to guide all transactions; and its court of solitude is an additional reason to mark the bim as a being upon which religion sealed its heart, and on which the voluncy has eaten its instant.\n- Yes. No man can read the previous \"traits\" without feeling proud of the film as a peasant. Will respect love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with courage, in part when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify his words before this tribal affair where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character deserves his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-opposed consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleetset.",
    "9": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very fanciful in the West. Amang the Arabs it seems to be your common: it has not, however, spread over the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has only clussum its present form since the division of the Latin arid Greek churches; at this time, the idea becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the biood of the young and beautiful life. In the west, it spread, with a little variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, Lorraine, where the belligerent existed, which the vampyres soaked during the night a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who emancipated, lost their strength, and spiedily died of consumption, while these human blood suckers fattened, and their veins distracted themselves to such a state of repletion, to cause the blood of all the passages of their blood to flow, and had even porques of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary, is a curious and, from the course, a credible one. It seems that, in an exarnination of the commander-in-chief and the magiftratos of the plane, they declared positively and unanimously that, about five years after.\nore, a certain Heyduke, named Amold Paul, had been hard to say, that, in Cassova, on the froriticers of the Servia Turkjsh, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing it with his blood. However, this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a colleague himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made that four priests had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove further evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free from corruption, and ernitage to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure arid florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they were subject to a personalized remedy. A splash was pushed erirely through the heart and Arnold Paul's body, also, it is reported to have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. This did, he cut his head off, burned his body, and threw the ashes into the bis grave. The same measures were adopted with the cors de cesperfans who had previously died of vampyrisin, lest they in turn become agents upon others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampy, even a vampy himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis rodomontad incontrosity is related here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of this observation than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while it was in existence, that the dececlsed is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to entrust infernal visits only to those bracts he loved most on earth, to whom he was bound by kinship and afsection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, after Vampyre sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre: then the place of origin shall be scorned, and thou shalt suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight shall drain the streom of life: yet hate the banquet that is to feed thy living corse, thy victim, and Ere lhey, and exhale, know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, and cursest them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But whoever for your crime must fail, the youngest, the best loved of AlI, will bless me with the name of a father — This word sball envelops your heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must liven up who releases his lifeless blues; then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when the bottom of Asfection place was worn — But now is horno away from your Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy teeth gnashing, and thy lip wreaking; then, hunting toward thy sulten tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afritf rave, Til self in horror shrinks awcly of the blind spectre cursed that they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned to the grave with the aim of tormenting him, she loved better when in existence. But this cannol being assumed to resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout history as a type of cornplete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long amount in his journeys of several amazing cases of uampyrisin, to which he claims to have been a cyewitness; and Calmet, in his great support work this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrates effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a c lassic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and intrepid opinions about this singularly horrible superstition are added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a net, necessarily devo-\n, and which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that the term Vampyre is the most general attraction, there are several other synonyms with it, making use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardaulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe learned that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, he appeared to the various parties of the island leaders, a nobleman, more noticed for his singularities, than for his rank. He looked at the glamour around Hiin, as if he could not participate in others. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his intention, so that he could be stifle by him, and sink into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this sense of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, at a glance to pierce through the inept wheels of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to be invited to each house; all desired to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the violatory excitement, and now felt the weight of the ennul, were happy to have something in the presence they were able to engage their attitude. Despite the deadly hue of his face, which never gained a warmer hue, eithor of the blush of modesty, or srom the strong emotionality of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, mary of the hunters femalo aftercr notoriety atlempted to gain his attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might call emotional: Lady Mercer, who had heard the mockery of all the bloody monsters squeezing her mooring, threw herself in her way, and djd all bvt put on the robe of a montebank, to draw her attention :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her But if the common adultress could influence even the guidance in his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to the hive: however, this was the apparent prudence that he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that he never spoke to a few women. He had, however, the reputation of an irritating tongue; and that he would even overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, being also often among the women who form the boclst of their sex as domestic virtues, as among those who jostly him by Burmese vices.\nAboul the samic, the era came to London, a gentleman of your name Avbrey: he was an orphan left with a single sisler in possession of great weight, by the parents who died while he was alive. Allowed to benefit also by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they took over the most important charge of his mind in the custody of the subalterns emergency, he cultivated into his imagination than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high feeling of honor, ardent, which every day ruins so many thousand appearances. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the violence was thrown away by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he learned that the misery of cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the peer eye by irregular folds and various combed patches. He thought, in the end, that the poets' declams were the reasons for life. Hc was handsomo, frank, rich arid: for these reasons, at his entrance into gay circles, many mothers furroved hjm, slrivating who should linger with the least truth through larigating or snoring favoritejtes: beats at the same time, by their brilliant faces when to be approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he quickly led to notions of his talents and bis merit. Attached as he was to the romance of the hif solitary hours, he was surprised to discover that, except in the tallow and the caridles wox that sparkle, not the presence of the type of a ghost, but the lack of sriuffing, there was a rio foundation in real life for the clny of these congreries of pictures and pleasant descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described came across him in his business career.\nHe tossed it, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in bimmoine, who gave a few other signs of his observation of the oxternal abiects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: to allow to imaginative hif of picture each thing that has undermined his propensity to extrovant ideas, he quickly formed this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid him attention, and also well advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthven's business would be embarrassed, and soon wild, from the notes of preparation it — Street, he was about to travel. Wishing to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, hod only when his authority, he suggested to his tutors, that it was time for the young to take a few steps rapidly in the career of vice to get on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to cling as if fallen from the sky, which never scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasant or praise, according to the degreo of competence carried in the portage lhem sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, were surprised to obtain from HLM a proposal to Jainhim. Flatterod by such a mark of estemm from him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it glodically, and in a few days they had passed the waters crossing.\nUntil now, February had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found that, although many more of his act...\nHe was presented in his view, the results contradicted different conclusions of the apparent reasons to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubreycauld did not avoid remark irig, that it was not on the urgent, reduced to indigence by the malfortunos allentarit even upward of the virtue, which was granted hjs aums ;— these were sent from the dorm with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came for osk something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to revalue in his lust, or to sink him still dip in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charjty. It was, however, attributed by him to the rigorous imporlunity of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virulent indigent. There was a circumstance about charity if his Lordship, whob, was even more impressed by his spirit: cling to those on whom he was granted, Inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were almost never Ied to the scaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other bassoons by which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his campaign seized the centers of all the vices in fashion; tberc hc entered the spiral of the faro table: he bet, and alwa ys gambla successfully, except where he knew more sharp was his contagonist, then lost himself even more than than he won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, it was not, he encountered the eruption young novice, or father without chance of a nocre family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more firo than shot of the cat that would deliate with the half-deod mouse. In all the cities, he left the once rich yauth, torn the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the splendour of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this friend; while many fathers sat frantically, in the midst of the airs speaking of hungry children, without a single petbing of his immense late wealth, whenwith to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediately lost, for the ruiner of many, the last guilder which had just pulled himself out of the convulsive grip of the innocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the convincing of the most experienced. Avbrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and bcghim to resign this charity and the pleasure that proved the ruin of all, arid did not take to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — although every day he his friend would give him an opportunity to speak French and opo only to hire; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification than the constant excitement or vainly wanting to break this mystery, which to his exact imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his companion; he left him every day in the morning circle of a Countess of Italian, as he went in a scarf in the anniversaries of the almost deserted city. The letters came from England, which opened eagerly; the first came from his sister, breathing riots, but sprinkling; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had grasped the imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough reason for the helif. His guards immediately infused his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, so that the possession of irrosistible power of soduction, bjs rerided bjs 1 habits more dangerous for society. He had been disembodied, that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the haste of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, starting from his guilt, should I be thrown from the pinacle of unsulniated virtue, to the bottom of the abyss of the infamy cld degrclation: iri fine, which all the thase females he sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even sunk the mask apart, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of their vices to the pubic gaze.\nAubrey determined on the leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a possible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, in the way while, also watch closer, and not to let pass any slight crucial instances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he had mainly friqueriled. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried female to be encountered in society; he was therefore forced to pursue bi plans in secret; but Aubreys also followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, although there was nothing to say. Losing from time, he entered Lord Ruthven's estate, and abruptly asked the lady for her intentions with respect, irriforming him at the same time that he knew that he was about to do it that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he would all have had such an opportunity; and after being pressured-\nHe intended to marry her, he just laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, talk from that moment on he must refuse to accompany Hls Lordship in the remajnder of their proposed tovr, he arded his servant to look for other apartments, and call the lady's mother, informed her of all to be known, riot only with regard to his daughter, but also regarding the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven sent his servant to riot his full consent to the separation; the hut had no suspect of his having plans was defiled by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey dirocta bis headed for Greece and Orosa peninsula, soon found himself in the Alches. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon took over himself by tracing the erased documents of the old gory on apparently monuments, shameful to chronicle the acts of sreemen only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichen. Under the same roof, there existed being, so beautiful and so delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful in Muhammad paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much of a spirit for someone to think that it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plclin, or stumbled along the side of the sheep, oria would have thought of the glzelle a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, sar trot sleopy luxurious look of the animal sulted but to the taste of an epic. Theanthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in his research antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuil of a Kashmere butterfly, would show all the height of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just decrypted a hate almost offacod, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. Otteri wanted his braids to collapse, by freaking around, expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, he migrated world excuses the oblivion to the anthill, which leaves the very object that he had before tangbt of vital importance to the poor interpretation of a passage in Pausanias in his mind escape of his mind. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but black con appreciating ?— It was innovation, beauty and indignation, without being affected by crowded rooms and stilling bailels. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep an affectionate during his working hours, she stood aside, and he took care of the rnagic flaws of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his harmful place; she would describe him the circular dance upwards on the ploin open, would paint, lo he in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects who had obviously made a great impression on his mind, would tell him all the supernatural talcs of the sheepfold. Her fervors and the apparent failure of what had been there, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and after as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friend, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by nourishing the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence later the following months, her blood ran cold, while being tempted to laugh at her over with so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of them, close to parents and children, had been found marked by the stamp of the friend's appetite; clinging when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to beautify him, because it had been noticed that those who had deluded to question their existence, had shown a somo, which forced them, with grief and hearing, to confess. She detailed him the troditorial appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; he, archiving, limon persisted on persecuting her, still could not be the truth in the ber fears, although at the same time he wondered to them any coincidences that evil all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey Hogan to become more and more attached to Iarithe; innocence, so contrasted with all the emotional virtues of the women among whom which had sought for his vision of romance, gained the heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English clothes, in rying an uneducated Greek girl, he found himself even more attached to the almost magical form of mistreating him. He at times torn himself from her, and, relying on a plan of some anliquarian research, he went away, tortured his object, which he had reached, so as not to return until; but he still found it impossible to focus attention on the ruins of Tbe around him, while in his mind he retained an image which seemed to be the sole owner of his trick. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was sure the same infantile frarik being that he first had a kriown. She always seemed to separate herself from him, but it was because she didn't have someone with whom the sbe could visit her hand favorite, while her tutor was busy sketching or discovering a fragment which had escaped still destructive the harid of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several Presents, affirmed their existence, despite the horror of the very name. Soon after, Aubrey determined to proceed on one of his excursions, which was to keep him for A few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both to return at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no reinain Greek even, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resorle of the vampires in their night orgies, and bare the heaviest evils against him who dared to cross their way. Aubreys unfailing the light of their representatives, and tried to pull them out of the idea; but when to be seen in shudder to his drawing so to mock a superior, unfaithful pagan, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he waf silence.\nThe next morning, Auhrey set out on his ultimate excursion; he mocked serving the melancholy face of his host, and he was conned to discover that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had infused them with such terror. When he was about to leave, Iantbe came to the sidekick of his horse, and sincerely begged him to come back, the night passed allowed him to put into action the power of these beings ;— he prosternized. Hc was, however, so busy in his research, that we did not see that the daylight was coming to an end soon, and that in the borizon there was one of those spots which, like ., warmer climal, so quickly assembled in an atrocious mass, and poured the anger of the Iloir on the devoted land .—He finally, however, a mountained horse, decided to reborn by the speed for his delay: but he was too loti. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sets of svn, begins the right: and ero it advanced poorly far, the power of the storm of Tbe was above — its thunders failing had barely a resting interval — its thick beak cliri forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning of Tbe seemed to fall and radiate at its own feet. Suddenly, his horse shook, and he was carrified by a draconian rapidity through the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, was kindled, and found, by the glare of thinning, that he was sweeping in the vicinity of a hole that barely rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that overcame him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one for the guide to me, or the least confident to get a shelter against the storm of Tbc. If he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a worn mingling with suffocated mockery, exulting with a laugh, continued a sound almost intact ;— he was surprised; but, awakened by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with an effort of the svdden, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He apparently was not perceived, because, roughly, he called, always emotional sounds, and no waf advice taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately had fun; when a police crashed ,\" Again bafflid !\" to whom a loud laugh succeeded; he felt struck by once whose strength seemed superhumari: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from the bis feet and threw with a huge force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself vponned, and kneeled on his chest, had put his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave Iight in the day, disturbed hiin ;— he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, struck the door, and iri a memorial the crushing of the branches, as broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there; afraid Auhrey, incapable of moving, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered; the light of their torches fell from the walls of the phone tube mvd, and the tip loaded on each individual straw with heavy saot flies. At Aubrey's decision, they were shaking for the one who had attracted Hiin by his thunderstorms; who was again left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again on the hill, to perceive the aerial form of his liver producer brought a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a visitor coming from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same farm, when he closed them, strangled by his side. There was no elour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence in his foe that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat had bows of teeth opening his vein :— to this man pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many visions of brighl and fairies, now fallen with the flower of lily that had died the witch. He did not know what his tufts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and take refuge in vacaricia. He held almost unconsciously in his hand, a dagger riaked of a peculiar construction, which he had found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who wrongly searched for her, which a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the family, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" To describe their logic would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the death of their child, they looked at a Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were unconsolable; both died in the heart of a broker.\nAubrey boing put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would appeal to LordRuthven and Ianthe—by an incompetent combination he saw to beg his former companion to spare the heir whom he loved. At other times, he permeated the evil-doers at the top of the pearl, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time that you arrived in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately put me in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter recovered from his dclirium, he was horrified and amazed at the sight of the one whose image he now had combined with that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implicating almost receptance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more so by the ottention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconoiled bim to his presence. His seigneury was changed; he appeared no more than the belrig apathy which had so badly asloriishod Aubrey; but from saon as his convalescence began to accelerate, he gradually withdrew in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference between the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his staring staring at him, with a smile of the musician playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to observe the tideless waves that the breeze cools, or to mark the progress of those or those 6s, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seems to want to avoid the eyes of He.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and the elasticity of the spirit that had distinguished him so much today seemed to have dropped forever. He was today like much a lauder of solitude and silence like Lord Ruthven; but, although he wished, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; he sought in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Ianthe stopped by his side — if he sought in the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; their suddenly turned around, bathed, at this, the wild imagination, his palc face and his throat bent, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to fly scenes, each of which has created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he had been bound by the care of the lender whom he had taken from him during his illness, that they visited the regions of Greece and that they had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and searched for every place to which a reissue could be attached; but although they hadtened in this way from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what they looked at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the protended darigers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the iris inhabitants, once they traveled only with birds, more guides your soccer class than as a fence. Upon entering, archever, a riarrowdefile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, had the reason to repent the most negligent; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistling of bullets close at their head, and by the echoed ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, complaining of the hand rocks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, in imitating their example, have for a moment eaten up the turning sheltered from defilement; but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with cries of irisult, told them to move forward, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, of any of the should thieves ascend ahoue and take them in the reor, they decided once to rush in search of the enemy. He had scarcely lost the refuge of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a foam in his shoulder, which led him to the scratch. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking account of the contest, his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rulhvens wounded, immediately dropped their weapons and surrendered.\nBy the beginning of agriculture,\nArd, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his rogue friend to a nearby hut; and having accepted a ransom, he was no longer troubled by the historical presence — they were content to keep the anger until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly unleashed; in two days mortification followed, the arid path seemed to move forward with the rapid pace. His conduct and his taste had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his reindeer apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offering his help more seriously than usual —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than — I mean the riot of my life, I heard the death of my existence as a bit like one of the day passing; but you can save my hair, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" said Everybody. e :\" need to be lucid, but my 1 ive ebbs apace — I cannot explain everything — but if you want to make yourself heard everything you know about me, my hanour was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"-\"Swear !\" Crjed the man dying, rising with exullant violence ,\"Jeter hy all your soul reveres, by any nature your feors, swecler that, for a yes or a day you will not in part be your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"- This cyes seemed to burst their slippers from :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he mocked his pillow, and did not breathe more.\nAubrey rolled to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that attended his knowledge with this man rose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a chilling cold came from him, as if from the present something horrible awaited him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to escape the hospital in which he had left the body, when a thief met Birn, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been transported by the swallow and the comrades, to his retreat, to the pinnacle of a neighborhood mountain, according to a promise they had given to his ship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that grew up after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But, querihe had climbed to the top, he found no place before the corpse or clothes, thaughtho brabbers sworn that they indicated the same rock on whom they had aided the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superslistic rnelancholy who had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave him, and quickly arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a money ship to Otranto, or your Naples, he took care to organize these effects that he had with him belonging to your Lord Ruthven. Among the other things, there is a café containing several weapons of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the date of the victim. There were several daggers and aghans. While turning them around, and looking at these curious sleepers, what was his desire to find a horn ostensibly decorated in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastening to get more proof, he put away the weapon, and hishorror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, although particularly high, to the horn he held in his hand. His eyes saw that they did not need a certain fury, they paid the gazeling to be bound to the dclgger; but still he wanted to disobey; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the shaft and sbeatb were similar in both splinter, and did not leave the room for the doubl; there were also drops of good on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, the investigations of this first were correcting the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. His parents were in the distros, their fortune runs, and he had not heard of him since the departure of his secretary. Aubrey Mirid became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had fallen a life to the destroyer of the earth. He became more and slender; and his only profession was iri exhorting at the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of a person whom he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon hurried him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of the fathers bjs, and there, for a mother-criterion, seemed to lose, iri the embraces and edges of his sister, all the memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantish phrase, had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been motionless by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to emerge from a misfortune, but of a certain feeling inside, that seemed to indicate the conscious soul of a more brilliant kingdom. The hair stage was not as light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was federated and pensive. When Olone, her face was never straightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother blew her emotions, and shook in her presence, those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, which could exonerate her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—this face were their playing in the light of their own national sphere. It was still only eighteen, and had not been presented to the world, it was bought by its guardians more appropriate than its presentation should be delayed v. The return of its brother from the TB continent, when he might be his protector. It is now, therefore, resolved that the next salon, which was fasci approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the mission of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy lunch that gave him power. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into the city, and prepared for the day of the next, which was announced as a drawing.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing-room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile deroyclly, seized it. Aubrey over there with her sister. That he stood in a corner all by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the remembrarice that the first time that he had seen Lord Ruthvcn was in this very place — he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized too well, sounded in the ear bis —\"Remove your oath\". He had little courage to turn, searsul to pay for a that spectrum would explode, when he perceives, at a distance from a little, the same figure that had attracted his opinion on a spot when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs resusing almost to carry their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm off, and forcing a passage through the dirt, he threw sons into his car, and was driving home. He laid the room with pressed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would drink from his brain. Both. Ruthven kissed him once again — from the starry circumstances — the dagger — his oath. — He reminded him, he could not contain him — and he resurrected again !— He believed that his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real—to be determined, therefore, to go back to society; for although he had tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the narne hung on his lips, and he could not sue for information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a nuclear relationship. leaving neither protected a mountain, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself to his own devouring sighs. Finally seeing that many were leaving, he woke up, and entered another room, four times his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked of movc, turned, and revealed to him the hc more awkward traits. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a furious march, forced her toward the street; and at the door he took the multitude of servarites waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged, iri passed them, he again heard that the voice murmured by him :\"Remember the oath !\" He did not turn, but, in a hurry to his sister, soon came to the house.\nAubrey almost got mixed up. If before hisismind had been absorbed by the once subject, how much more completely was absorbed, now that the certainly of the monster's life again prostrated on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke a few words, and those who were terrified. The more he thought, the more children there were. His oath surprised him ;— was he then for a monster to raam of 1 half, carrying a ruin on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his sister was hit by Hiin. But even if he broke his oath and discussed his suspicions, why would he believe it? He thought of using his own group to free the world from such misery; death, but he remembered, had already been murdered. For days, he was born again in the state of this; locked in the hall, being seen, laughed one, and eaten only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his beating, to support the nature. In the class, he is no longer able to carry calm and solidly, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, the class often were extinguished at the pleasure of noon as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used peas to follow him; but he was soon distanoé, who fled faster than any frenetic thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all the friends bis, with a friend among them, bone that the presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter society again, and look at him closely, anxious to farewam, despite his oath, to Il WHOM Lord Ruthven learned with jintimacy. But that he entered a room, his hamburger and his suspicious gaze were so striking, his inner thugs so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that touched him so much. When, however, novelstrance proved to be unavailing, the guards thought appropriate to interfere, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they had a great time gaining that confidence that had previously been imposed upon them by the parents of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had every day in wandering his, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye those who include what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him consistent. He didn't like to notice him, his completely was his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence became at least so Greek, that he was confined to the upper chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He became ill emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and resuscitation remaining appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he sometimes began, and, being his hands, with eyes that severely affected him, he wanted not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he resisted, her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And once again, he sank into the cold, even if she couldn't wake him up. The months lasted: however, gradually, as the year passed, the incoorences of this became less sequential, and his mind threw a part of the darkness of the spirit, while his guardians observed, several times in the day, he rushed over the fingers of a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians ericing his room, began to converse with the doctor whose purpose of the circumstance of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to he married. Instant Aubrey joy was coupled; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whom they feared he had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country whom he had met with society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be a present among the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. Hc was again able to be asphyxiated by the influence of his beautiful smile; for he pressed himself to the chest, and kissed his cheek, with tears, flowing to the idea that his brother was once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all his warmth, and congregate it on his wedding with no one was so distinguished to cling to every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced a look on his chest; opening it, the whale was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster that was so bad looking infvented his life. He captures the portrait in a parodysm of rage, and the trumple under the shot. On his asking hirn why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing the bear's hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of face, he told him to swear that she would never marry the monster, because he — but he did not covet advarice — it seemed that this agclin voice made him remember his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lard Rulhven was near him, but did not see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought this was but the clear return of his disorder, entered, and Miss Auhreys forcing, wanted her to leave him. He fell on their knees, and irritated them, and begged them to do it one day. They, attributing this to the imagined they madness, had a prisri possession of his mind, conveyed to the human pacisy, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had read Illed in the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with every elf. Weberi heard about Aubreys ill health, he easily understood himself to be his cavsus; but when he learned that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly hide from those among whom he obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former opulence, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of a great affair for brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually wants the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His ton of dangers and labors to resign himself—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy for any being on the crowded earth, sacrifice with whom he addressed himself ;—could say how, since he knew her, existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if just were simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the brain elder falling at his head, obtain an important embassy, which served as an excuse for honoring the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed slate of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAbbrecy, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to inherit the servants, but in vain. He asked for paper and pen; he gave him; he wrote a liter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the grave, who once held her in their arms, the hope and hope of their house, to delay but for a few years this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, giving him to the doctor, he thought that Miss Aubreys spirit should no longer be harassed by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmate of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that can be more easily designed than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally vanquished their vigilance, they stole it carefully, leaving in the custody of an old help woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie was out of the room, and in a cold moment, found sales in the apartment where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive hern: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him to snore the room, without a voice with age. When Lord Ruthven whistled in his ear on the stoircase ,\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his opponents, who had come to seek him, and were shaved by the old woman. Aubrey has no support for langcr himself; her rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and it was passed to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as a physicjan, was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey increased; the blood efffusion produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and when midnight had struck, he presented himself in the form of a room that the reader persecuted, and he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guard shaved at the protective Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, he was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys fissure had glutten the third of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was all he was, he, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his guide .\"\nEN Sailing across the Greciari archipelago, aboard one of the ships of the majesty bif, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mityl-\nEne, on the island of that name. The beauty of this area, and the certain supply of always cattle and vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both warm and merchants; and although it finds itself rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We disembarked; as a visual, at the bay jacket, while the men were used to water, and the handbag mingled with natives, the clergy. and I brought rain into the cave called Homers School, around other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we mix with a young Greek like our guido, and we said that he had come from Scio with a Lord English, who left the island four days before our arrival in his festival. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said Groek ,\" and would have taken Mc with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, when I was likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zcchinas for lt ,( about L 250 English coins ,) and resided there about f weteen months, although not constantly; for he sails in his felucca mery often to be different islands .\"\nThe certain exacerbated our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose the lime in the haste at home where our courtryman had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bathroom, with an attached closet. They were all simply decorated: wooden walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtlo in the center of the tob, and a small fonlain benetb, which could be played lo through the branches by mo by vrombing a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a lean posture; a large cushioned sofa completed the furniture. In the hall, we held a dozen chairs of English cane, and an empty library: lrc were not mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedding had simply a cold large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a paw – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble niche. Fortunately, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the chest of a great sailor in the eliset: it was open, but we didn't think we were just --\nIt is a question about examining the content. On the tablat of recreation are the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of Vonney, Zimmerman, in German Languagc, the Messlah of Klopstock, the novels of Kotzebue, the plcly of the Robbers of Schiller, the Paralife Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1980, several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Conslantinople, very torn, but no English book of descriptor. Most of the books of these were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over the r, and marked with paper sheets of, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The first had read these books in the evening before he died, and he forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for his particular, that is, I would move a thing without order, he would frown me far a week together; he is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; afraid I had the product of this form for the trouble to take care of it, except twenty zechins which I put to an old Armenian whore in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought to the house of Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was rising. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. Roof, bent by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey bandage, under a strong linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus irritated, for them, the Greeks pass their crazes by smoking, by drinking wines such as \"lachryma Christian\", by eating fruits, and by taking advantage of the cevense breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees mingled together on its borders, the arid shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seat with a wooden bar of ornamental was placed, on which it is said that the Lord spent many of his evenings until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" Praying for being was very fervent, and always went to our church twice a little, next to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a view of breadyc\". A line of lunch vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into a broken waterfall, until it was the lowest in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smoath in the form of grass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and an little on the left, near a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islets have been distinguished, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but over requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armerian\" said our conduct ,\" Could he say so, but I am sure he will not ,\" and can you be let down, old friend ?\" \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare riot .\" We didn't have any time to visit Armeniari, but on our return to the city, we learned several participants from the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when being in the last town island, and even dancing with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to the mcln name, horses to the others, and cotton and silk to the acorns who live by the weaving of lhèse articles. He bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. Iri short, it seemed to us, from all that we have chosen, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend in college thought as it should be disclosed. He had a Mosl beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a plano-fortus, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing that it could be that this rambler in Greece. He had money, it was obvious: he hid the philanthropy of dispositiori, and all those ecce nucles that mark particular g enjus. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a puppy from WYATTS, who travelled poorly to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been the same year of the house; but \"Childo Harolde\"heing put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Capital on every page. Did we regret not having 6 more curious in our research at the cottage, but we were oonsolated with the idea of returning to Mitylene ori somo tomorrow; but to me who will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not quite interesting, and in court in the right name of my Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, inverse to association with nature, human, or contrituling in any way to soothe his eyebrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anecdotes. All the more sinister sentiments of the earpiece, if elegatively represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their sits in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to strangle him like a being on whose Heart Religion sealed his seal, and on which the hard Volunteerism cast his profile. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" of the preceding without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The deportations must always be the subject of a warning, especially when they violate the moral integrity of a man; afraid who dares to justify himself before this terrible tribulation where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and refraining from applause to the world, is the certainty of a virtuous heart and self-conscency.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Fleet-Street.",
    "10": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam Prison.\nThe superstition on which this story is stuffed is very general in the east. Among the Arabs, it seems to be commori: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not assume its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek church; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt is buried in the territory Jr ., it gradually increased, and sowed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the cd of elevation of their tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a certain variation of ligature, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the claimed belief, that the vampyres soaked in harm by some part of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost the strength of their, and quickly died of consuinctions; while these fattened human blood-svckers—and the veins of the air became dislinked to such a slate of repletion, so that the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even from the very porous babes of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a bearer, and, of course, credible at the expense of a particular case of vampyrism, which is declared in Hawaii, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that upon an examination of commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they have asserted positively and without arid, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had heard to say, that, in Cassova, ori the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampire, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of the tomb of Tbe Vampyre, and rubbing himself with his hood. This preclusion, however, did not prevent Bim from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, in one person complained of bavingbeen lormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attouches. To avoid other nrischics, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, taken the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be useful in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, purc and flower blood. The hearing evidence was kept, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. This did, they cut his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of these people who had previously died of vampyrism, lost, they should, in turn, become agents on others who have bred them.\nUniversal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and suck in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than another instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment that appeases death, for some heinous squash committed while in existence, that the doceased js was not condemned to vampyrise, but forced to consine his infernal visits to these beings he bequeathed the most to the atrium — those to which he was bound by ties of kindred and afseotion. — A supposition allowed to be \"Giaour\".\nBul first on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, Tby corso will be praised from his tomh; then haunt the native piece, and suck the blood of all your race; Tbere sromthy daughter, slster, woman, around midnight droin the current of life; yet hate the bariqvet that must feed your living corsus, Your victims, are still exhaled, Shall knows the domon for their sire; As you cursed, about the cursed, Your flowers aro wilt on the stem. But a little further your crime must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — The word will tear your heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of the eye, and the last glazed look must see who freczese over his life without blue; then with without allowing the hand half tear. The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock that shorn the most dear commitment of Disorder has been worn — But now is carried away by the Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your nibble tooth and your harassed lip; then will you rush to your grau, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until this in horror frowns with a more ceremonial specter than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in a wild blue beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is reprogrammed as having returned to a lho falls in order to torment him, she loved better whiest in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have been the result of the finesse of her life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and insanity. The true Tournefort gives a long story on hif travels on several amazing cases of vampyism, towhieb it claims to ensure that both an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and narratiusillvstratjue traditionalistic to its effects, has pvt ahead some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as barbaric errors.\nAlthough the term name is the most general acceptance, there are other synonyms used in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, etc.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a winter of London, there appeared in various parties of the leaders of the town, a noble, snoring remarkable for his singularities, that his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate in the three. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew only the attention bills, so that he could, by a glance, turn it off, and throw the fear in those panties where the slap reigned. Those who felt this feeling of awo, could not explain from where it arofé: cared for it attributing it to the dead grey eye, which, extending on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce the through within the work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of Ieaden that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities made him invite in each house; all wanted to see him, hang on those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, arid now felt the weight of energy, were pleading at having homebing in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly hue of the bis face, which never won a warmer turn, eilher of the hlush of modesty, 0 r of the strong emotion of passion, softening her sorm and its contours were bavtiful, many women burgers after trying to gain their attention, and winning, at least, some wbat morks that could be described as affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the wick of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything except put on the dress of a mountain bank, to attract her uncle :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it nevertheless seemed that they were unperceived ;— evcris that her unheard of impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But even if the common adulter could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not because the female sex was undifferentiated to him; but it was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtual wife enthralled with an innocent daughter, who knew that he was speaking to her. He had, however, the repudiation of a long hesitation; and if it was even overcome the fear of his singular character, or if they were moved by his apparently hatred of the vice, he was also often among those semals who make up to boast of their sex of their domestic virlues, as among those who shove him by their vices.\nAbout the sarne era, a young gentleman named Aubrey arrived in London: he was an orphan left with a single sieve in the position of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they took over the important more charge of his mind in the care of the inercary subalternants, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, that high romantic feeling of honor and caridour, which every day ruins so many apprentices of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and yet this vice was thrown into by Provideanoe simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: it however that the misery of a collage merely consisted of clothing, which which were like worm, but that work better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the reo-\nThe lyrics of life. He was beautiful, frank, and ric h: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, glorifying with the least truth, their languishing or blushing favorites: the girls at the time came, by their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his ips, soon led him to false notions of his talk and his merit. Attached as much words to the romance of his solitary hours, it started 1 to find that, except in the tallow and candles of thal clicked wax, not from the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffing, there was a rio foundation in real life for any of these corigeries of pleosing images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed the study hjs. Faithful, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to relinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, met him in the career of this.\nHe struck him; he had the improbability of forming an idea of the character of my enjrely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine all that flattered propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object into the hero of a novelist, arid dlerminé to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before bim. He has become familiar with him, has paid him slits, and so far has advanced on his pass, which his waf pronunciation has always been recognized. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthvens fairs were embarrassed, afraid soon found, flouting the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of gaining some information about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generals was thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the carcerof vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as fallen from the shoes, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of ability to carry them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently bad nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, ordered in a few days, they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHitberto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results offered different conclusions of apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle wanderer, and thorobeggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey was not able to avoid sterling himself, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the miffortunef hadclent on virtue, which he granted his olrns ;— these were sent into the door with sneezes barely suppressed; but when the door of the deflll came to clutter something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Bim to harden himself in his chandelier, or to sink the hiin even deeper into his iniquity, who was sent back with a rich charity. However, he attributed Thif to the importunity of rigging of the vicious, which prevailed over the abundance of virtuous indigents. There was one circumstance that escaped the charity of his Lordship, which was still innoored on the bis spirit: all those on whom there was hestowed, inevitable found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scasfold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject miferous. In Brussels and other cities that they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent impatience with which bis compagne sought centres of all the fusbionable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the faro table: ho betted, and always played successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than being gclinated; bvt it was always with the same immutable face, with which he gazed gencraly at the society around: it was not, however, if he encountered the eruption young riovice, or the son without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to come out of the law — this abstraction appeared from the mind was set aside, and his eye split with more flre thari than cat while dallyling rnovse. In every city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle, he decorated, cursed, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the satc that had drawn him into the reach of this friend; while many father sat down, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his immense delay 1st, where with even buying enough for satissy there present envy. However, he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, for the junior de mony, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the controversial catch of the irinoeerit: this could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commenter, capable of fighting the continuing of the exposed inore. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and beg Hiin to resign from this error and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and not terrible bis. But he delayed it, for every day, he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to walk openly and openly with him; however, it happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than the hive lip; and although Aubrey was near to his curiosity, he did not get more gratification of it than the constant excitement of vainly washing to broak that mystery, which also half exalted the begari imagination to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion for a while; he left him in daily assistance on the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of memorials of another deserted city almost. While he was thus risen, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing something but affliction; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had already entered into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his composition, they seemed to give high enough reasons for belief. The guards insisted on leaving his friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, so that he possessed an irresistible bone power of seduo-\nTian, made his constitutional habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his coritempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had required, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be shaken from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, all the thosc females whom he had had a bad soughl, apparently because of virtue jr ., had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and not had scrupulously exposed all the deformation of vices jr to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined upon by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which left the eye. He resolved to invent a plavable project to abandon it altogether, purposing, in the medium, looks to look hlm plus closely, and so as not to let the light circumstances pass without notice. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose house was especially frangled. In Italy, it is a scandal that an unmarried woman met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all the windings of hif, and saon discovered that an assignment had named bcen, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, although without a troughhold. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and suddenly attached his intentions to the lady, informing her to the same time who knew that bis was about to move her that all night. Lord Ruthven replied that he had intentions such as he believed that all men had such an opportunity; and on the beginning he insisted on whether he intended to marry outside, only laughed. Avbrey replied; and, in writing a note, to say, that from this moment, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in their plan of visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and by calling the lady's mother, inferring his bone all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthin sent his servant in effect so that there was no agreement on separation, but the riots revealed that any suspense of his plaris had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Tube peninsula, soori found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the elevation of a Greek; and soon took possession of himself by tracing the fadod record of clricient glory on mariuments which apparently, assimilable to chronic acts of TB to free men only to be slaves, were hiding under the sheltering floor or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might formed the model for a partner wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of fajthful into Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for anyone at think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the pawn, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a poor type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged the eye bear, apparently the eye of the riature engaged, for this luxurious and slender look of the animal adapted but to the last of an epic. Ananthe's light stage often accompanied Aubrcy in his search for antiquities, and often there was a carefree girl, engaged in the pure oss at Kashmere hutterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered upon an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. When the woveldher tresses falling, as she wilted around, exhjbit in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and softly discoloring dyes, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before having vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but the noise can appreciate ?— It was innocence, beauty, without being knocked down by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. He drew the remains which he wanted to keep for his future hours, looked at by, and looked at the magic effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of his native place; she would then describe him the open peain, would paint, to him in all the colors drawing of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that obviously had a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nerve. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had passed through the midst of her friends, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong the existence during the moving months, her blood would be cold, while drinking of the laugh of so idle idle fantasies; but Ianthe citd à hi in the names of old meri, who had finally detected a living between them, after several of their close relatives had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when she relieved her so unbelievingly, she asked her to believe that she, for he had been noticed, that thase had dared to question their existence, had always had given proof, which obliged them, with grief and comfort, to confess that it was true. She stripped him of the traditional appearance of these walruses, arid his horror increased, hearing a descriptor of Lord Ruthven cautiously precise; he, commentcver, still porses by persuading it, that there could not be the truth of inber fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a bliss in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthucn.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocuous, so contrasted with all the affected victims of the women among whom he had sought far his vision of love, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying on the uneducated daughter Groek, he found himself even more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped himself off from the chair, and, forming a plan for some antiquarlan research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that only split the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same naritile frank being that he held first round. She always separated from him with reticence; but it was, of course, she had no longer any name with whom that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy fetishing or infiltration of a fragment that had still escaped the destructive band of time. She had addressed her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, a pole of horror as a narne itself. Soori culture, Aubrey determined to carry out one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all both begged him only to return to the neighborhood, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever be certain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in the night orgies of Jr, and denied the heaviest rules as imminent on the one who dared to cross their palh. Auhrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when they saw them trembling at his daring test to mock a superior, infernal power, whose name even apparently had the blood frozen, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and what convinced you find that the words bjs, mocking the belief of these awful fools, had inspired them such a terror. When he was about to talk, Iantho came to the side of his horse, arid implored the aamest of him to relurn, ore nig that allowed the power of theseo beings to be put into action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy his research, that he made riot perceive that day-ligible wantsoon fine, and that on the horizon there was one of the lhosespecks who, in warmer tbe cimates, so rapidly gather in an enormous mass, and pour all their rage over the devolved country .— He finally, however, moved his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern coast, is almost unknown; immediately the sun runs away, the night begins; and he had advanced for, the power of the storm was above — his echo thundering bad barely a resting interval — his heavy heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning worked seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the entangled sarest. The animal lost, through the fatigue, stoppode, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hole that barely high of the masses of dead leaves and brush --\nGood around him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to push him into the city, or at least have the confidence to get shelter from the storm painting. As he approached, the thunders, for a silence of a woman, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who inflamed herself with stretching, exulting money with a laugh, continued in a sound almost without draft ;— he was surprised: hut, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on the pearl, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was approaching....\nHe was not perceived; although he called, it seems that he was anointed, and no notice was taken of him. He found himself in contact with an ori which he seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Always mocked !\" to which a loud laugh laugh laughed; and he felt him harassed by someone whose strength seemed superhuman: wet to sell his life as dearly as he could, he strangled himself; but it was in vain: And he fell upon him, and knelt upon his breast, and put his hand upon his throat, when the brightness of the torches ranny entered the hole that lit the day, dislodged him.\n— he rose instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he was broaching through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now until; and Avbrey, unable to move, was heard by those who were not. They stopped; the light of the hives fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each straw with large soft straws. At Aubreys will, they loved him, who had attracted him to his cries; they were again licked in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tob burst even more, to perceive the aerial form of the beautiful conductor of this brought into a cross without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a frenetic raising vision of his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lap; but there was a silence over his face which seemed almost as attached as the life that the Ance lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men poired, wept, struck simultaneously the spiritual horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was sown, and Aubrey was lajd by the side of her who had been lctley at hjm the object of so bright rnany and fajry visloris, now fallen with the flower of life trot badly died in the ber. He did not know that he was thinking of the whale, that he had a bloody mind and that he wanted to flee the reflection and take refuge in a vacant place, and that he held in his hand a bare dagger of a particle building, which had been found in the cabin. They quickly met with different parties who did not have a good time in their search for her that a mobber had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, told the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrcy, and poirit à la course. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubroy being put to bed had a more violent fever, and was delirium often; at these intervals he would otter on Lord Ruthven and high Iantho — by some accountabthe combination he seemed to be the beg of his old companion to spare the care he loved. At other times, he irritated the mollitudes on his head, and angered him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from what is a motuué, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, he placed himself in the same house, and caused his dismay. When the latter recovered from sondelirium, he was horrified arid with the sight of a bim, whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthvcn, by his kind words, almost repentant kindly for the fail which had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; there appeared only apathetic twigs that were so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalesoence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrewly in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the former man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: do not know why, but this smile flouted him. During the most difficult stage of the recovery of Tbe involid, Lord Rutbven was apparently committed to looking at the tidal waves removed by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the sun without glaring ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weak eryed much, and this elasticity of the mind which had arice if it had now seemed to have fled forever. He is now a lover of solitude and silence like Lord Ruthven; but many things he wanted for solitude, his mind would not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he saw it in the midst of the ruins that had once been fractured, his shape stood by his side — if he looked for it in the woods, his slight step would get bogged down in the middle of the undergrowth, in the east of the modest violet; then turned suddenly, huddled, to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded face throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He has determined to steal the scenes, all of which have created bitter associations in the mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom who held him the collapse bound by the terrible care he had taken from him during his illness, that they had to visit the ports of Greece had not yet seen. They traveled in each direction, and looked for any place where a recollic could be attenuated; but although they were so rushed into the place, however they seemed not to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of the undivided, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the so-called dangers. As a result of the club neglaot the advice of the inhabitants, or an occasion, they travel with only a few guards, more serious guidance than as a defense. When entering, however, a narrative defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of scrambled rock down the nearby precipices, they had resonated to repent of their negligence; barely were the whale of the part engaged in the narrow past, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the repetition echo of several cannons. In a moment, the thorium guards had raised them, and, placing them fell behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imilating their example, retired for a while because of the apritising turn of defilement: shameful hurt to be held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, bade them advances, and being exposed to a laugh without resistance, if one of the robbers must rise above and take them to the rear, they dissuade both of the rusb forward in search of the enemy. Barely had sheltered the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him the grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the thieves around HLM — his guards having immediately thrown their arms and furs on Lord Ruthvens wounded.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to pass on his wounded friend to a nearby rabbi; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their practice, merely keeping the entrance until their currency returned with the promised sum, for that he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly diminished; in two days the brittle mortification, and the death seemed to move forward with rapid steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; being as unconscious of the pain cls which had been objects about him; but towards the last night close, his mind became apparently neasy, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was iridescent to offer his assistance with more serious useful –\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I mean not life iny, I listened to death and if my existence is saddened like that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" said Everybody. e :\" need a little, my feelings apaoe, I cannot deploy the wbole, if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweelr by all your soul resents, by all your nature fears, swears that, for a year and a day, you will not lose knowledge of my origins or death to any living being in an arian way, no matter what happens, or what you do not see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he laughed on his pillow, the arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey relirod to rest, but did not sleep; the many eircmslances containing bis accalntanee with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; that he remembered his oath a cold chill came to us, as if of the presentation of horrible something waiting for him. With his ear rising in the morning, he was about to bleed out the hoof in which he left the corpse badly, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was not the black loriger, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, upon his reliering, to the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that it could be expiated to the first odious ray of the interior that lifted up his death. Aubrey deafened himself, and took several men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But when he climbed wrongly to the top, he found no trace of eiling the body or the clothes, killing the sworn robbers, they were pointing and on the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the body of Tbe for the stroke of Tbe.\nWeary of a backstage in which he had met with such terrifying misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to heighten this superstitious melancholy that had grasped his mind, he resolved to hate her, and soon arrived at Smyr Ria. While waiting for a vessel to pass it on to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of securing the thase effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several offensive weapons, minerals or less suitable for the execution of the victim case. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. What did he do to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — having to get the further proof, he flanked the weapon, and his terminal can be imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, though particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at being bound to your dagger; but still he did not want to believe; but the individual before, the celebrity voicing tlnts upan the haft and sheath were like in the splendor of both, and left no place to doubt; there were drops of blood of alfalfa on each.\nHe left Smyrria and, on his way home, alone, his first investigations corroded the lady whom he had tried to seize Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, she had not heard of beer since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen to the victim of the deftroyer of Iarithe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of the running speed of the positions, as if he were going to hatch the life of someone he held dear. Arrived at Calais, a bride, who had seen his will, soon threw him in the English parts; and he hastened to his father's marion, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the shades and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the class. If before, by her infanline caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, which was more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the gaze and applause of the salon assembly. There was none of this slight shrillance that exists only in the heavy atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not see the birth of misfortune, full of some feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter room. Her step was not that light that goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedated and pensive. Werialone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence, those deed that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have changed her fury to that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes—that face, then played the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been born, because she had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be dislodged by the return of her brother from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was now resolved that the next drawing-roister, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have denied staying in the house of his fathers, arid fed down the mearicholy which dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashionable strangers, when his child spirit was so torn by the vents that he had witnessed; but he decided to make his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city of China, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive, a living room had not been held for a long time, and all the jobs were anxious to rest in the smile of royalty, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he threw himself into a bim, he entered the rememor that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in his place – he suddenly sounded himself by his arm, and a voice that he also recognized usual, sounded in the bis ear –\"Remember your oath .\" How should bardly courage to turn, fearful to see a spectre that would explode, when he perceived, at a little distance, the sarne figure that had drawn his attention to this spol upori his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, arid, forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, arid fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would be inflamed with his brain. Lord Rutbven again before him —circumstances started vp in the terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up a bimbo, he could not believe it was possible — the dead are still resurrected !— He thought that his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; so long he tried to ask the cornering Lord Rulhven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in going the information. A few nights, he went with his sister to the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recolon, and there he joined his own devours. Finally, seeing that many people were waking up, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass through and revive her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these traits that he most abborted. He took his sister's arm, and in haste he forced him to the street; and at the door he took the multitude of servants waiting for the lords; and while he was taking care of them, he heard again that the policewoman dared him :\"Remember your oath !\"He dared not turn, but,\" said his sister ,\"soori came to the house.\nEveryone became almost distracted. If, before the bis spirit was absorbed by a subject, how much more complete he was confused, now that the certainty of the living of the mother has again pressed upon his thoughts. The attention of her sister was no longer heodized, and it was in vain that she inducted him to explain to him what had caused her sudden conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath was suffocating ;— was he then to allow this monster to roam, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not averted his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if jf was to break his goal, and reveal his suspicions, who would be in favor of him? He was thinking of using his own group to free the world from such a misery; but Declth, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; he rose up in his room, saw no one, and ate on 1 y when his sister came, w0, eyes flowing with tears, coughing him, for her, also supporting nature. Finally, unable to support the arid solidide, he left his house, wandering from the street to the street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His robe was glazed, and he wandered, as despite the midday sun as at night humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he put him down to the rest where the fatigue spilled. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon far away 6 th who fled from a pure father than any – from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left all his friends, with a friend among them, bones whose presence was unconsclusive, who determined to enter again into society, and waltz him closedcly, anxious to predict, despite his death, all whom Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his cursed and distrustful looks so striking, his anvils are so visible, that if his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so much. When, how, the demonstration turned out to be unavailing, the guards thought it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that the spirit would become foreign, they thought it was a high time to regain that confidence which had previously been imposed on them by Arthurs parents.\nDesirovs of having saved him snort the wounds that he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prove him to expose him to the general marks of the eye of what they considered to be faith, they hired a physiciari to reside in the house, and took care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, so his mind was damaged by a terrible subject. His influence finally became so big, that he was confined to his chamber. There were often days, unable to be woken up. He became emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only remaining sign of effect and memory appeared on his sister's entrance; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to lick him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is to be, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" and again, she sank into the alphabet, from where she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, as the year passed, its inconsistencies become less frequent, and his mind ripped a porlion out of his gloom, while his guardians observed that several times in the day he came on his fingers, a defined number, and the smile of tuna.\nThe time had collapsed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he anxiously asked whom. Happy with this return mark, because they feared that he had been deprived, they insinuated the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he had met with in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They responded to the riot, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again in a position to be affected by the influence of his smile; for he pressed her to the breast breast, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the mind that his brother was once again allied to the feelings of infection. He began to speak with all his won warmth, and to conjure him on his marriage with such a distinguished sor rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprise to highlight the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He grabbed the portrait in a parox....\nSome of the rage, and trampled under the feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he did not underestimate it, then shaking his hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of Countrice, he told him to swear that he would never have married this walruser, for he—but he could not move forward —he seemed clis if this way told him again his aath—he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Rutbven was a swallow but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return to her disorder, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his pens to them, he begged, he enjoyed them to delay, but one day. They, attributing this to the imagined madness, had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven had called The morning after the living room, and had a brother refused to evory another. When he heard of Auhreys ill health, he easily understood that he was his cousin; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hard to hide from those among whom he had won this computerist. He hastened to make the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great offense for the brother and the interested in his destiny, he gradually gained the ear of Mifs Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had darigers and oils to tell—could speak himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded plateau, except with whom he addressed himself ;—could say how, as he knew, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, except that he could be listed with his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of Saat, that he won his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained the important embassy of Ari, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to place the lake the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physiclan and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she enjoyed her own tattoo.\nss, his own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the gravo, who held him in arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which heaviest curses. The servants promised Ibey to abandon him; but by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrcy's miride by, what he hates, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; the avil Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily imagined than ribed, notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, gradually fading away, leaving a bim in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a bound was over of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the chamber, though speechless with fury. Wheri on the strollcaso, Lord Rulhven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee in the day, that Sister Yaur is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his aliens, who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage found no ventilation, had braked a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, the wife left London.\nAbbreys weakness increases; blood efficiency produces symptoms of the dowry approach. He had his sister guards called, and if the hour of midnight had struck, he would constantly resume what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards havetened to protect the Misf Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, Aurid Aubreys sister was thirsty for VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world of Tbe was quite here, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his greed .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, on one of Her Majesty's ships, iri in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the east 1 and by that name. The cause of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have there, junges many British ships to visit it — both men of war and merchants; and although rather outside the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. Wo disembarked; like usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men used us the watering of iri, and the trading exchange for the wild cattle, the natlves, the ecclesiastical and the mysels caught a mble at the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the bone front Mount Ida (a mountain smoll so named) we took with and hired a young guide Greekas tour, who said of he had had Scio eome with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said here ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose with Mililene, where I probably got married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid he has left an old man in charge of this one: he gauges Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English Curriculum ,) and lived there fourteen months, he is not ebbing; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity a lot, and we lost no time in haste to the house where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by the old man, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were decorated with all sirnply: light green walls, marble tables on the other side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small brieath fontairi, which could be made for play through the bracbes by moving a spring fixod on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posture; a largec or a sofa coplicated the furnillure. In the room, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor singleclining. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the chamone bed in Greece. In the living room, we had a recreation nearby. Once, the old man told us, flipod with books and papers, which were then in the section of a seafaring large in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the containers. The works of Volteiro, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmcrman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller on the brigands; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several brochures from Constantinoples Greek press, very torn, but no description is English. Most of these books were written with marginal riots, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scratched everywhere, arid marked with paper briefs, on which were also noted.\nThe old man said :\"Iord had read these books in the evening sitting that he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, says how, they must lie there his roturry; for it is so special that if I saw anyone living without order, he would frown me for a week together; he is always very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the distress of taking caro af il, with the exception of twenty zesh ines which I pay to an Armenian card who resides in a cottage srall in the wood, and which the lord has crushed here, Adrianople; I don't know why .\"\nThe outer appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty pieces long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars with black plinths and working comes of the frets (as it is now the usual architecture? Iri. Greek) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone bolustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under the property of coarse linen strong. Most of the house-tops are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, driving light Winos, such as \"lacbryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the bloody breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we were erising the house of Tbe, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental weaden back, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his legs and nights up to twelve clocks, walking, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the man of Eid, praying ,\"for he was very dovout, and always went to our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of the seat was what could be called the 6 c \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mo urit Calcla, covered with arid olive trees myself in a bioom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple opened iri majestic cay. A small stream came from the ruins descended in broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sca smootbas glafs, arid a harizon not eclipsed by a single cloud, terranates be seen in frorit; and a little on fear, through a view of high hazelnuts and palm trees, small islands several were diftinctly observed, spreading the spots of the light blue wave with emerald green. I liked a quick moro that I did; but our investigation.\nThe name of the person who had lived in this romantic solitude was without a result: no one knew his name, but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Armenian,\" weld our driver ,\" could say, I sure he won, he says, and cannot, my old friend, if I can, he says, I don't dare. We did not have the time of visit the alien, but upon our return to the city, we learned several parts of the secluded lord. He shared the view of the young girls when he was last on the island, and even panicked with them at the wedding feast. He scratched a cow to a man, hordes to others, and colton and silk to the girls who first made these articles. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from everything we have collocated, for having a better cell, a very ecoenteric character benevolent. A circumstance that we have a letter, which our old friend at the cottage bought clean not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom he was often seen walking on the seashore, and he had bought him a picture, and had taught him how to use it himself.\nThis was the information with the which that we left from the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all these eccentricities while renark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, what had been troovervelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" said to be ,\"but that you are worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him call Mililene .\" We have never heard of his seigneury's face, as we had been a few years of hoine; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on each page. Have we not been more curious about our research at the cottage, but we have consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene for a future day; but for me that day will not return. I made a statement, I was not entirely unworthy of it, and in court, I said the good dream of the secretary, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to asocialism with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his grief, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anecdolefs. All the finest feelings of the coffin, so elegantly veiled in his seniory poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at rest is an additional reason to mark him as a being long ori whose hat of the Hoarl religion sealed, and on whose head, the Volunteer has thrown his intestine. Man No can read the pleasant \"traits\" before feeling proud of him as a countrymon. With regard to his love or his pleasures, I do not assume the right of giving an opinion. Reports are always received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral guilt of man; and the one who dares to justify himself before this horrific trial where everything must appear, only can convince the mistakes of a confreremortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and confidence of salt approval.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printcher, Crown Court, Floet Street.",
    "11": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is stuffed is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend it to the Uritil Greeks after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed its present farm only since the division of Latin and Greek herches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still outcast, of dead lho rising from tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight voriat ion, throughout the Hungclry, Poland, Austria and Lorroin, where the belief existed, that the vampyres nightly soaked up some of the blood of their victims, who had emaculated, lost their strength, and died suddenly of consumption; while the fe bumans sucking fatted blood — and their veins dissipated to such a state of repletion, in order to cause the blood flow of all the passages of the laher bodies, and even of the same beards of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, the account weedible bone, a porticular case of vampyrism, which is said to be made to take place in Madreyga, Hungary. He aspires, basing himself on the exomination of the commander-in-chief and the magisterates of the place, they warn positively and without complacency, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been tormented by a company, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating from the suin of the earth over from the tomb of the vampyr, by rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a hirnself vampyr; sar, about twenty-thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being lured by him, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants consulted their Hadogni, took the body of TB, and found it (as it is supposed to be usual in vampyrism cases) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting to this moulh, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. After being obtlinated, they resorted to the usual dream today. A stake was completely led through the heart and body of Arriold Paul, where it is reported to also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his dog, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the horns of these people who had previously died of vampyrism, Iest they should, in turn, become an agent of the poor of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it adapts to the illustration of the subject matter of almost any instance that could be produced. In many parts of Groece it is considered as a kind of punishment after dealing with a heinous crime committed in exile, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his visitsatlons instead only to those beings he loved most when on earth — those to whom he was bound by afraid bonds and affection .— A supposition alludes to iri the \"Giaour\".\nBul first on the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be of the tomb to rent; then hauntingly haunting the place of origin, and sucking the bood of all the race; Thrust snore thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the parse of life; Yel tarnish the banquet that persecutes must feed thy livid living corsus, Tby victims, be they exhale, They shall know the devil for their sere; As you cursed, your flowers are wilted on the stem. Butane for your crime, Most Fail, the youngest, beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father: This word will envelop your heart in flames! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the last icy look must see which freezes his lifeless blue; Theri with hond without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, De which, in life a lock when the thorn The tenderest Plede of Trouble has been worn — But now is carried by you Momorial of your agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy tooth of gnashling, and the lip of gagard; and after the tomb of sulten, Go-clend with Gouls and Afrits rave, till those with harair shririk far more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr Southey also lows I introduced in bis wild but beautiful poems of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr course of the good Arablan Oneiza, who is represented as bringing back from the grave with the aim of tormenting bim should better loved whiest in existence. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of her life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long amount in its travolf of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have witnessed ari; on Calmet, in his work green vpon this subject, besides a variety of aneodotos, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a ciastic, af well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions on this singularly horrible right superstition be added; although the present many suffices for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by a simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in most genres acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in the various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Braucoko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt has occurred that in the first of the dissipations accompanying a London winter,\nthe different parties of the chiefs of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its similarities, the rank of their jobs. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could participate in the scene. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted his attention, that he could by looking at the calm, and throwing foals into the breasts in those who thought reigned. Thoso, who felt this filiation of fear, could not explain from where she clones: sorde attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a proper glance through the iriward functioning of the heart; a bull fell on the cheek to the mind a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His weaknesses invited him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to sow him, and those who had been accustomed to violent extermination, and now fell the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of enganging their tension. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, with the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her shape and the outside were tiring, many of the women hunters after did not try to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Morcer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marlage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountainbank, to attract her attention :— though in voicing :— when she stood before him, although her eye was apparently fixed to her, it seemed however unperceived ;— even unacclaimed impudence was baffled, and she came out of the field. But if the adultery commune could not influence even the guidanoea of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. It is bad, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and that it is that even he has overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they have been moved by his apparent hatred of vico. He was also often among those women who make up the boast of their fear of their domestico virtues, as among the others who push her through their vices.\nA 6 at the same time, he arrived at Lo London called a young gentleman by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphari left with only one sister in possession of a great belt, by the parents who died who were still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guardians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the custody of the subalternants, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which completely destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed all tosympathy with virtue, and bought that vice was cast by Provldenoe only for the effective procedure of tbe soene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a coat simply consisted of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which ch were better suited to the peer eye by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of poets were the relatives of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for this reason, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least noise, their languishing or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him in the notical salsé of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the arid candic wax torch that freaked out, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life if there were none of these pleasant congreseries of photos and descriptions intersected in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding a little complacency in his gratified vanity, it was abhorrent to give up his dream, when the extreme being that we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe took possession of himself, and the impossibility of forming himself on the idea of the character of a man was absorbing himself, who assured a few other signs of his observation of extortive objects, that tacit consent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine the ury thinking flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, which quickly formed this object in the hero of a romance, and determined at 0 bserve the ofspring of his faney, rather than the person in front of him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and until now canceled his opinion, and his presence was always recognized. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthueri's working quarters were confused, and he soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this singular character, which, until now, had directly struck his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in thevicc caroeur to put themselves on equality with age, and not to allow larn to appear as so frustrated the sky, whichever intrigues scandalous are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or phrases, agreeing to the degree of competence shewri in the transport lbem ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on the part of the hive, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthuen, and now he has found, e, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different opinions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His company was profusc in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the bar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not point out that he was not on him virtuous, reduced to indignation by the calamities that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he begotten his alarms ;— these were sent out of the white gate barely apprehensively sneezing; but when the traffic came to ask for something, not to cast down his desires, but to bring him down from his lick, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, who generalized on the retirement of the indigent virtue. There were atrocious circumstances about the barbarity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on just, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk down and the most abject misery. In Br ussels, in other cities, they passed by, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent enormity with which his companion sought the centers of all the fashjonable vice; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and played always with with success, except where the kriown was his anlagonist, then he lost more than he had gone; but it was always with the face without change of shame, with which he generally looked at society around: he was not, however, if he would encumber the young rah novito, or the unmarked father of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with the mouse of the balldead. In every city, he left the devious asfluent, torn from the circle, he looked, cursed, in the solitude of a dragon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat fraritic, in the midst of talking about children hungry for mule, without a single sarthing of his immenfe riches, where with buying enough tropi to make their present carving happen. Yct he took a rio silver from the embossing table; but immedally losl, to theruinor of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the irinocent: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which is not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to resign himself to his friend, and to ask him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and which did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him a sinequa non opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he was not given a gratification groater from it than the constant exotation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which exalted the magination began to fuss the appearance of something supernoural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, arid Aubrey sore a time lost of sight of his companion; he was afraid that he would enter the daily room in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he was marrying in search of the memorials of another deserted city. When he was engaged, letters came from England, what he opened up withwitb impatient; the first came from his sister, breathing anything but the afsection; the other wreaths of his guardians, the latter forced him; if he had before irito buried his imagination that there was a pulpit in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seize his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly flawed, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to rob his gralificatiori, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from unwelded tho pirinacle of justice, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females that have had suggbt, apparently in accour of their virtue, had, from the beginning, even thrown the mask, and had not grated to expose all the deformity of the vices tbelr for the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on Ieaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invite home plausible pretext to abandon him altogether, seeking, in the whole region, to look at him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is sedom that an unmarried woman is mixed up in sodomity; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye trampled him in all his windings, quickly climaxed that the transfer of clri had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an irinocent, although he was without a daughter. Leaving no time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, arid abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, the information at the same time that he was aware of his being out to meet her that very night. Lord Ruthven replied that his emotions deserved as he would all have had on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry, let him be destined to marry him, only laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately written note, to say, trot from that moment. he must decree his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to cut off other apartments, and calling the mother of the lady, informed him of what he knew, not only with regard to the her daughter, but also with regard to the character of his lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day, Lard Ruthuen simply sent his servant so that he had not given his complete consent to an exclamation; but he raised no suspicion as to his plans, having been thwarted by Aubreys irriterposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to take hold of the faded recartes of ancient monuments and poor heart apparently, shameful to broach the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same reds as himself, existing being, so beautiful and delicate, that she might formed the model for a painter whipping for pavrtray on canvases the promised hope of failure in the paradise of Mclhomet, saue hot hcr eyes spoken too much spirit for Anyone to think it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain of Tbe, one would have thought of the gazelle a poor type of hor castics; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of animated riature, for this luxurious pâté sleeping of the suitable animal but to the taste of cln epicure. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his forin, floating as it was on the wind, at the avid gaze of him, who slanged the letters that he had just deciphred on a tablet of the extreme brazen, in the context of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids fall, while she wilts around, exhibiting in the ray of the sun, such delicately bright and swiftly fading hves, he may well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the voric object that he had before being of vital importance for the proper inlerprelalion of a passagein Pausclinas. But why try to describe the tears that everyone feels, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by they rowed drawing rooms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing these remains of mourning, he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and galvanized the magical effects of her peneil, tracing the scenes of her bloated natius; she would then describe him the circular dance on the open place in, would fold to him, in all the flamboyant colors of the memory of the youth, the marriage pump that she remembered outside of the infarction; and then, turning to the subjects that had obviously made a greater impression in her mind, would tell her all the tales of the natural of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she shared with him the story of the vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful fairyle to prolong his existence from the months that followed, his blood was running cold, while he landed your laughter at these horrible fantasies died; but Ianthe quoted him the riams of the old men, who had found themselves for the last time among themselves alive, after sovenal of their close relatives arid children had been found marked by the seal of the friend appetito; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged to believe it, for he had noticed that those who had dared to distract themselves from their existence, had always had a proof of glvc, which forced them to confess to himself and to break his heart. She gave her the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthvenley. However, still persisted on persuading her, there could not be truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many circumstances that had all tried to excie to a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Rulhuen.\nAubrey began to cling more and more and to inorer love Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected by the women he had sought for the vision of love, gained his heart; arid as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without due, he found him ever more attached to the charity of the fairy enchanting him. He tore it to Tyrines from hor, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he went away, decided not to return in vain his object was attacked; but he still found it impossible to fix his waiter on the ruins to adorn him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possession of his thoughts. Iantbe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same welcome of frank children as he had known the first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was well known that she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite crowns, while her guard was occupied in a sketch or discover a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with a very name to harpor. After Saon, Aubrey decided to make one of the brief excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, they all at the same time begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, which no Greek ever means, after that day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as a seaside resort of the vampyres in their night forces, and gave the heaviest even as imminent on the one who steals to cross the path of them. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them welder to his audacity, so as to mock himself a superior, infernal power, the very name of what apparently made their blood frecze, he was silent.\nThe next morning Aubrey left at the end of his trip without lingering; he was surprised by the observation of his host face, and was concerned that the words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired the trick of such a terror. When he was to leave, Ianthe Caine to the faithfulness of his horse, and sincerely prayed to him to turn back, the night allowed the power of these beings to be pvt in action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he made riots perceive that dclylighl was going to get angry, and that in a horizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in an atrocious inass, and pluck all rage on the devoted country .— He finally, However, mounced his horse, describing him to catch up by the speed for the delay of this: but it was too late. The twilight, in these moods of soul, is almost unknown; immediately the sun warms up, the night begins; and if it had been advariated far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failing had barely a interval of rest — its thick heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the cover, whipping the forked blue lightning seemed to irradiate its own feet. Suddenly, his horse took a frigbt, and he was carried with terrible speed through the stumped forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a bollel that barely rose up the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he said.\nIt is about finding someone to guide him in the city, or at least relying on him to get him from the storm basin. As he approached, the stubborn rs, for a silent moment, allowed him to pull out the terrible screams of a woman who was mixing with the suffocator, exulting a mocky of cl laughter, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised: bul, agitated by the thunder that agairi rolled on his pearl, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself found absolute darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was not perceived at the time, because although he was called, the audience was still intoxicated, and he was not informed. He found himself in contact with someone whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Again mocked !\" to whom a great laugh began to stir; and he laid down himself, struck with a force that seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and cast huge forces against the ground; his enemy threw himself on the hiin, and leaned on his breast, had laid his hands on his throat; when the girth of many torches leaning through the hole of that lit him in the day, he shook him; he immediately rose up, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at one moment the crash of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heed. The storm was still; and Aubrey, the incapable of murmuring, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered; the height of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thalcb loaded each straw with heavy footflakes. To the desire of Aubrey, they sought her, who had drawn the bim with her cries; they left him again in darkness; but what he abhors, which the long of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the cliry form of his beautiful conductor brought into a course of life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an raising vision of his dislocated imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strangled at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a mortilège about his sace which seemed as almost attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throal were the marks of teeth hovering open the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, silently struck the wilhbornor ,\" In Vampyre! Phantom !\" A litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the subject of so many brilliant and magical vibes, now fallen with the flower of Iifo who had died with her. He did not know what the gypsies were, if the spirit was inflamed and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, which learned of the city, prepared the parents for a terrible catastrophe. \" It is impossible to describe the sorrow of the child; but when they ascended because of their child's debauchery, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsulable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed will be seized with a violent inost fever, and was osten delirious; in such intervals he called Lord Rulhven and on Ianthe—by an inexplicable combina, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being that he loved. He permeated the curses on his head at the time, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance at the time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, on hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constituent and landing. When he recovered from his delirium, he began to see the one whose image he had now combined with the image of a colleague; bvl Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, implies jng almost repentance sher the fault that had caused their separation, and felt renounced by attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury felt completely changed; he seemed to be only the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; bul as soon as his brain convalescence to be quick, he gradually connected in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the old man, except that to tymeshe was taken to meet his gaze fixed on bim, with a smile of malicious exutation playing on his lips: he knew no reason, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the restoration of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in the waltz of the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in the marking of progress of these orbs, circumstantial, like our world, the motionless sun ;— in fact, it seemed to lose to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys inarid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elastia, as the spirit that had once distinguished him today, had the right to flee forever. Ho was now as fond of solitude and silenco as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he frequented badly in form, the shape of Iarithe was by bis side – if he sought him in the woods, bcr light not would be errandiring in the middle of the wood, in the shadow of the modest violet; then suddenly blushing, would show, to his wilid imagination, his pale and wounded face, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all the characteristics of which created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Steven, to whom he was bathed by the tender care which he had taken from home during his illness, that they did not visit these parts of Greece or have yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but they bathed in the room, but they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to lighten the tbe relations, which they imagined to be the invention of individuals, who were interested in exciting tbe generously from those whom they defended from so-called darigers. In the consecration of those neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, one day they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. At the entrance, at the end of a whirlwind, a narrow defilement, with large masses of rocks descended from the vicinity of the precipices, they had reason to repent of their rigor; for there was little of all the parties engaged in narrow plss, when they were surprised by the whistling of bvllets near their heads, and by the ratio of echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction of them from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltering of the defilement: but shameful to be so hated by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, made them advance, and being exposed to the slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they decided to one to rush in search of the economy. Had Hordly lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rulhuen received a shot in the shoulder, which had a rough hole on the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the help or his own peril, he was surprised to see the hearts of the thieves around him — his guards having immediately cast their arms and furs on Lord Ruthvens wounded.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a neighbouring hut; and having agreed to a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they simply kept the disobedience read out their comrade should retum with the promised surname, so that he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and deglaze seemed to soften with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unaware of the pain that he had been boned, the objects lowered him; but towards the end of the last evening, bis mirid apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye flew up Aubrey, who was induced to for his assistance with more usual seriousness —\" Help me! You can save me, because you have not done more than beat, I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day ;6 but you can save my honor, the thank you of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \" I need, but a little — my life is accelerating — I can explain everything — but if you would concentrate all you know of me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying husband, rising up violently exulted :\"Swear with all your soul, with all fear of nature, swear that one year and one day you will make known my crimes or death to the living being on the way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"Juss eyes seemed to burst out of their pockets :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was laughing on his paillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey rested, but did not sleep; the many circumstances altering his anguish with this man rose up on his mind, and we do not know why; when he remembered his health, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the preepitation of the same horrible thing lament him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the hovel in which he had left the orpse, when a sedan met hirn, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retirement, to the prince of a neighbouring movement, according to the promise they had given to his lordshlp, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several men, determined to go and bury in the place where he lay. But, when he climbed wrong to the top, he found no trace of either the body or clothes, although the robbers feared they emphasized the identical rock on which they laid the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in the conjecture, but finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the false clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for heighten that superstitious melaricholy who had seized his mind, he realized to leave him, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While he was waging lamentations for a ship to die in Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of those that he had with the bomb belonging to Lord Ruthven. Other cases included the case of several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to evacuate the victim's death. There, several daggers cling. While turning them around, and looking at the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an apparently omented sheath in the same style as the dagger discovered in fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to get other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he untied it was equivalent, though peculiorially shaped, to the sheath he held in his group. His eycians seemed to have no need for further certainty — they seemed to look to be blind to the aggregate d; but still he wifhed to debellish; but the particular shape, the healthy variegation on the roof and the sheath were similar in splendor on both, and left from the place to doubt; there was also a drop of blood on each.\nHo loft Srnyrna, and on his way back to Rorne, his first inquiries were about the lady he had tried to stretch Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fort was ruined, and she had not been heard of the detachment of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had ransacked a victim at the anti-seaster. He became morose and silent; and his ordinary grip consists in exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calclis; a breeze, who seemed obedient to his will, soon taunted him on the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his falcons, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the embracs and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had won her fashion, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was still tied up like a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was incver a little over by the levelty bones in the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about this which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which appeared to indicate a consoious soul of a brighter rum. His step wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a colour could attract – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, her bag was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her pre-enccretion those sorrows which she knew destroyed his rest, who could have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She has not yet been introduced to the world, and his guards have thought that his presentation should be delayed until his brother returned from the continent, when he was his professor. That is why it is now decided that the next show, which approved quickly, should be the time of writing in the \"gold sawmill\". Aubrey would rather have stayed in his father's house, arid fed on the melancholy that dominated him. He couldn't feel interested in that. just the frivolities of the strangers foshionable, when his blood spirit was so torn by the events he had seen; but he dissuaded from sacrificing his own comfort to the protection of his sislor. They soon arrived in Taiwan, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThis crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship smile took it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he stood in a corner by himself, without worrying about everything around him, hired in the Romambrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that place, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, arid a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember Yaurs oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would make him lose, when he was perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his notice in this place when he first entered society. He looked at his legs almost by refusing to carry their weight, he was obsessed with taking a friend's arm, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He trampled the room with twisted steps, and fixed his hand on his head, as if he feared his thoughts would explode in his brain. Lord Ruthven once again beware of him—circonstanced startod iri terrible array—the dagger—bis aath .— He awakened him 1 f, he could not believe this possible—death rises again !— He thought his imagination had conveyed upwards in his mind rested on. It was impossible for him to be relaxed.\nSo he decided to return to society; for if he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name clinged to his lips, and he was able to obtain information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. leaving her under the prowess of a matron, he withdrew into a recreation, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. He awoke, and entered another city, and found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious ephemeral; and he tried to pass by and draw near to her, when one of them, whom he prayed to move, turned around and revealed to him those traits which he despised most. He went forward, seized his sister's arin, and, with a hasty step, forced her to the street: The door which he found obstructed by the crowd of servants who served their lords; tied while he was engaged in passing them, he heard again this voice which whistled close to him —\"Member your oath !\" He did not do daro to turn around, but, in a hurry of kisses, soon came to the house.\nAubrey becomes an almost difficult. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thoughts. The alteritions of her fisher were now unheard of, and it was in the vain that she forced her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more dizzy he was. His aath held him ;— was he a tiger that this monster should wander, bringing ruin upon the hell broath, in the midst of all that he held; and did he not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he had to break his ears, arid discloses his suspicion, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own band to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister clapped, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that he haunted. His dress was ravaged, and he wandered, often exposed to the midday sun as to medium humidity. He was no longer recognized; he first came back with the evocation at home; but finally, he laid him down to rest that the alien fatigue had exceeded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him to fled from a pursuer more than any — far from the purchase. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left all his friends, with a friend among them, with the presence of which they lament, who determined to enter society again, and watching Closcly, anxious to predict, despite his oats, all that Lord Ruthven approached with imitation. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and harassed eyes were so striking, the chills of bis towards the inside so visible, that his sisler was finally forced to beg of him for the abslairi to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. Wheri, however, the demonstration proved to be inavailing, the guardians thought the appropriate of interpas, arid, foreign that his mind was to become alienated. They thought it was a high time to resume ago in that test which had been imposed on him before them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirous to save him from the arid susferings injuries that he met daily in his wonderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired the doctor call to reside in the house, and take care of him consant. He hardly appeared in the riot, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There, he often lied for days, unsightly of the awake bell. He had emaciated the bee, the eyes of his had reached a glassy lust ;— the only sign of confection and memory remaining appeared on his sister's country then; then he would begin sometimes, and, saw his hands, with the thal appearances seriously distressed, he might have wished her not to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her only answer was :\"Truly! True !\" Again, he fell into a state, from which she could even wake him up. This lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and if the spirit was extinguished from a part of his globe, wept his guards, observed that several times in the day he counted on his frigers, a defined numberhor, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, rising, on the last day of the year, one of his tutors erecting his room, began to covet with his doctor on the circumspect melancholy of Aubreys being in such a clumsy situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, whose fear they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the noun of the Count of Marsden. thinking it was a young Earl whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them still swears by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to seo his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again capable of being affected by the irfluence of the beautiful smile; for he pressed it into his chest, and kifed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to his brother's hem to be once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate his own honor marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and excessive accomplishment; when he saw wisely a medallion on his chest; open it, what was it surprise to look at the profits of the monster who had so long Influenced his life. He captures the portrait of the table in an apparatus of rage, and the pietina under his feet. She then asked him to give her the resemblance of her future husband. He looked as if he did not stop her — by seizing from her hordes hands, arid looking at her frantic expression of her face. He made her swear that he would never marry this monster, far from there — but he could not accommodate himself —he realized as if that voice made her reborn his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthvonos saw no one near him. Meanwhile, the guards and the pysicians, Wbo had the whole beard, and thought that he was only a return to his trouble, entered, and forcing him to attack Miss Aubrey, wanted his leave hair. He fell for his bows to them, he made a plea, he begged them for your lateness, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, having taken the possession of his mind, loved to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had cracked in the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with all the others. When he heard of Aubrey's disease, which he himself understood to be the cause; bul when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultatiari and pleasure could hardly be corrected from those among the women he had won this information. He fell down in the house of his former companion, and, by his coerce, and the claim of much affection for the arid brother inlerost in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could terminate his power? His tongue had dangers and toils, which could speak of itself as an individualol having no sympathy to the mind any being on the crowded ear, sow with her to whom he addressed ;— could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had meant to appear to be a watchful of preservation, if she wore only that he could lift to soften the accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpent orle, or that was the fate, that he gained from horfoctions. As the bed of the elder branch fell long to him, he kept a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's dorriged state ), which was to take place the same day before the departure of the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physician and hift guards, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his fisher, corrigating it, as she valued her own hopepie, her own honor, and the honor of those who knew in the grave, who once kept beer in her arrns as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours the marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest mo curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving him to his doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Avbreys spirit any more by, what he considered, the trick of a maniac. Night passod on restless to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heord, with a horrible thal can be more easily concelved than described, notes of occupied preparation. In the morning, the carne, on the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up the most frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally vanquished their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman. He seized the opportunity, with a bond, was out of the room, and in a moment was found in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Rutbven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, shook him from the room, without fear of fury. When a staircase, Lard Rulbven bowed in his ear :\" Remember the oath of Yaur, and know, if it is not my fiancée by the day, that your sister Js was dishonoring. Women are careful !\" So he pushed him in search of his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage not finding a Vont, had broken a blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, like the public was afraid to hug him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and wife were spoiled for the fear of Loridon.\nAbbreys weakness increased; bloodshed produced symptoms or near-death approach. He disdained his sister's guardians, which were called, and when midnight had struck, he was in connection with what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had the gluld to the first of a VAMPYRE!\nEXT RACT OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNTABILITY OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE AGENDA, etc.\n\"The world fought in front of Bim, he chose his place of rest, and the guide Providence bis .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's castles, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of the castle. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattlo onvegctables always of having lérc, lead many British vessels to visit it — both men of war and merchants; and though it is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Srnyrna, its burgers pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed; as usual, at the bay bollom, and while the men were employed to water, and the sacrillary trading for cattle with the natives, the clergy and mysels took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so narrow) We met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who said vs. He came from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene Qujt, where I am likely to marry. He was a strange man ,6 on a very good man. The cotta above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old inan in charge: he gave Dominick, lbe wine-trador, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often for two different islands .\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time harassing the house where our man had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to our mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: plain green-staried walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrlle in the center, and a small fountain brieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed source on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane children, and an empty blanket: there are no mirrors, nor a single pain. The bedroom had only a large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common raven throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a rec glass of marble, once the old man said vs ., filled with hooks and papers, which were then in the chest of a lorgeseaman in the closet: it was open, but we did not think justified ourselves in the oxaminating the contons. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roussoav are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messich of Klopstock; the novels of Kot2cbue; the play of Schiller of the Rabbiton, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with maternal riots, written in the spirit of a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally seribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, ori, which were also remarks.\nThe old man of Tbe said :\"The lord bad when reading these books in the evening that he sailed, he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until they return; for he is so particular, that if I had to move something with orders, he would frown me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. One day I made him a service; and I had the products of this farm because of taking boredom care of him, attracted twenty zechins whom I paid to an elderly Arinenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord crushed here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the outdoor use was pleasant. The portico at the front was long and fourteen wide, on the canned marble pillars with black plinths and fret work cornices ,( as is the custom of riow in Greciari architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was wrapped by a beautiful procession of Turkey, under an awning of fort Iinen coarse. Most of the house roofs are furnished, as the Greeks spend their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"Iachryma Christian\", including France, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we went into the house, a small stream moved away, grapes, oranges and lindens clinged together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of blueberries, a grated soot was placed with a back of Ornamenal wood, on which we are told that the Lord spent many of his evenings late at twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the man of honour ,\" that he was shining because he was very fervent, and that he always otted our church twice a week, because Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A rich of vineyard line led a blue eye to Mount Calcla, covered with 0 living and myrtle trees in 6 loom, arid on the top of the one whose ancient Greek tompI appeared od in majesty desceoy. A small stream emitting from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was closed in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of high oak trees and palm trees, several small islands distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a view more than I did; but our riquiries were fruitless your name of which no one who had resided in the Romanic solitude: no one knew his riame but Dominick, the hif banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could say so, but I am sure he won\" and can you say it, an old friend? e :\" If I can, greet him, I will not dare. We don't have to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we have left several particulars of the secluded lord. He had been among the young girls when he was last on the island, and he danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving items. He also bought a new boot for a fisherman who had lost his fin in a storm, and he often gave the Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it all appeared, from all that we collected ,6 for everyone very eccentric and bone. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage, considered appropriate to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen bouncing on the seafront, and he had bought him a piano-forle, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island Mitylene os; love imaginations all on the rack, guessing who are the rambler in Greeocould. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all these eccentricities mark pecu liar goniu s. Arrived clt Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who has badly traumatizing in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he does ,\"what are you so conscious, if Lord Byron; I greet him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I saw him at Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had done a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla in each place. Decply was it regretted that we had been curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning at Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, I relieve it of all interest, and in the justice of the good name of his lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, averse association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as a way to be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his seniory poems, seem to have their seat in his bosom. The tendelle, the syinpathy and charity seem to spoil all his actions: arid his courtization of the rest of solitude, the additional ari reason for marking him as a being on whose heart, the religion sealed, arid on the head of which Bencvolence threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Reports are subject to prudence, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of the man; and whoever dares to justify his words before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of the other. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. For a good secret, and to escape the applause of the world, is the surest of the disadvantages of a virtuoso heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "12": "A VAMPYRE:\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is exhausted is very general in the East. Manga Arabs It seems to be emmon: it does not extend to the Greeks, however, until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has not flashed its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek church; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, it has gravitally inorased, and has formed the object of many wonderful stories, still in progress, or will deod raising their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful teeth. In the West, it extends, with some slight variations, only on Hungary, Poland, Australia, and Larraie, where the belies existed, that the vampyres soaked at night a certain porlion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and died quickly of consumption; whllst these suckers of greasy human blood—arrange their dry veins to such a state of repulsion, to cause the blood of all passages of their blood, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 was a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular oasis of vampyrifm, which was declared to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had heard said, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This prediction, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been moored by him, arid a statement was made, that the features had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhabjtants who consulted their Hadcligni, took the body, and found it (cls is pleased as being usual cases of vampyrjsm) sresh, and completely free from corruption, and eating in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was questioned, they used the usual queen. A stake was led entirely through the heart and the body of Arnold Pavl, where it is reported to have also shouted terribly as if it had been alone. That's what they did, they ripped off his head, burned his body, and threw crampons into his throat. The same measures were adopted with corscs of people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would become, in their turri, agents on the other who survived thein.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucks a vampyre becomes a vampyre hesels, and sucks in turn.\nChief, brilliant.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of present oservations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is consolidated a sort of punctuation after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties and affection. — An allowed supposition to the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus room shall be torn, and its tomb shall be torn; and then shall it haunt the notifying place, and suck the blood of thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet shall the beacon that persecutes Musl feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are yet oxpirc, they are demolished for their sire; as thou cursed them, thy flaws smite upon the stem. But one of them for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best bewitched of all, Sholl bless you with the name of a father — This word shall envelops the heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the tint of his oheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must see which freczos over it is blue; then with the hand without Halloween shail tear The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in lifo a lock when shom The background pledge of Disorder was worn — But now is carried away by the memorial of your ogony! But with your own best blood, I will drip; your squeaking tool, your haggard lip; then I will hunt for the tomb of sullen, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nSouthey also became irritated in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampyre the Arab handmaid Oneiza, who is represented as having turned brake thc falls for lhc purpose of tormenting hlm that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resisted the sinfulness of his life, being poured out throughout history, called a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long encounter in his trips of several amazing cases of vampyrism, so that he prec-\nand Calmet, in his great band on the subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forth a few left-handed dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nA lot of interesting information about this singularly horrible superstition can be added; almost the present can stand for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to cooperation, and which can be concluded by merely pointing out that the term Vampyre is that in most acceptances general, there are several others synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations attackling over a London winter, a nobleman, remarkable for his singularities, appeared to be the rank of his, to the various parts of the leaders of the town. He watched the mirror about him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the fair light laughter only attracted attention, so that he could look at it, and throw fear into the breasts of those where the reckless reigned. Those who felt his feeling of apprehension could not explain that there was aroso: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, clinging to the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and to a single glorice to pierce through the inner wheels of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarity invited him to be invited to all the houses; all desired to see him, and those who were accustomed to the exceeding violence, and now felt tired of boredom, were happy to see something in their capoble presence to attract attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her university, which never gcline a warmer hue, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong omotion of passion, although its arid form ovtline are beautiful, many female hunters after the avowed notoriety to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some morks of what they put the lerm affection: Lady Morcer, who had been on the mockery of all monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw her sons into her way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, lo attracl bis remarked :— although in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, just fcemed still as if they were vnceived ;— even her unalised impudenco was strewn, and she left the field. But the common adultross could not influence even the orientation of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent warning with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and innate daughter, that few know that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reproduction of a winning language; afraid if it was that he had overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they had been moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among the women who formed the thrust of their sox of domestic virtues to bebeir, as among those who shook him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young Gontleman named Aubrey went to London: he was an orphan with only one sister in the possession of the wealth of a dream, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Bequeathed also to himself by guardians, who only have to take care of his forturia, while they retain the most important charge of his miride to take care of subalterns of mercenclry, he cultivates his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of banality and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He did everything he could sympathize with....\nHe thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of a vestige like elotbs, which were also hot, but which were adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular foods and their various coloured spots. He bought, in the end, the poets' dreams were the reclicés of life. He was beautiful, devious and rich: for these rocous, upon entering gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or grumpy favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by the sparkling eyes of Burmese, when penetrated his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents and his meril. Attached as he was to the love of his spiritual hours, he storted to find, that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, nol srom lhe presence of a ghost, but in the absence of snuffing, lherc was not the true life of foundation iri for clny of these congreries or ple asing images and descriptions contained in these volurns, of whom he had formed his study. Finding, however, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being which had described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observer of external objects, than the lacitive assent to their exile, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of a romance, arid decided to obsess the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, drew attention to him, and thus to advance on his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, Lord Ruthvens business was embarrassed, and soon, from the notes of the preparation on the street, he began to surrender. Desiring to get some information about this character familiar, who, up to naw, had only better his urjosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow the yaungs to take a few quick steps in the vice career to put their choices on equality with the elderly, and not to make them appear of fallen from heavens, whenever scandalous intrigues ore Menlioné like the sub-jeots of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to carry the cm. They heard: and Aubrey immediately referring to his intentions to Lord Rvthven, was taken to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a morque of some dehjm, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accelerated it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubroy had not had the opportunity to ridicule Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found that, although many other of his actions have been expressed in his voice, the results have offered divergent conclusions from the parent motive of his conduct. His companion was proposed in the basic liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to revive their warit immediately. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was a riot on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the ottensive misfortunes even on virtue, which he granted to his alarms ;— these were sent out of the gate with barely repressed plots; but when the profligato came to ask for something, not to respond to his desires, but to allow him to tarnish his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he fled with rich castaways. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicjous, which generally outweighs the retirement bashfulness of the virtuous Indian. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, what was more impressed on his mind: all the ones that he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, because they were encumbered either led to the faffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most awful misery. In Brussels and in other cities, where they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent impatience that his companion sought for the censors of all fashjonable vices; they were interested in the spirit of the Fara table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, arid then hc lost everi more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, while whoj that he grieved the society around: he did not, however, spoil, if, when he enlivened the eruption young nouico, or chancelcsss falher of a nvmerous family; their very wish shone the law of fortune — this oppressive abstraction of the spirit was removed, and his eyes shook more fire than that of the cat while dealing with a hidden mouse. In every city, who left the old easy youth, torn apart from the circle being trimmed, cursed, in the society of a dungeon, the fate that held attracted him into the reach of his friend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the fugitive aspect of the mute hungry childron, without a single gathering of late Himdenweth, whether to buy even enough to satisfy their current desire. But he did not take money from the game of chance; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last dorlot that he had just started from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capoble of combat the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charitable pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit ;— but he delayed it — every day his friend gave him the opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and amplifying the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his uriosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the excitation contrast of vairily wishing to lobble this mystery, which at his oxalted began animation to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily room on the morbid circle of the Italian Countess area, while he went to the merchant of the memorials of the another almost descted city. Thus, he was engaged, letters from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from the sister bis, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the last surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination that the thorus was a bad power residing in his comparison, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately left his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, irritated his licentious habits, which were dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not generated iri hatred of ber characler; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the principle of vnsumed virtue, to the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask, and not scrambled to criticize all the deformation of their vicef in the public eye.\nAubrey, det-\ncriminated by leaving one, whose character had not shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, by means, also watch more closely, and not to let any light circumstane. He entered the circle of the sarno, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady he was dealing with. In Italy, it is rarely that a single woman is met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all the big windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent and thoughtless girl. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her of the same thing as being clear to be about to meet her very night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were firm as he all thought on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry to know whether he intended to confuse him, he laughed more. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately writing a note, to say, from that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the remorse of their proposed look, he ordered his scrutinizing to look for other apartmerits, arid calling the mother of the lody, informed him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. This assignment has been prevrated. The next day, Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; but did not allow any fuspicion beyond his years having thwarted the interposition of Hy Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, arid crossing the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of iri tracing the faded traces of ancient glory upwards of monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the sealing ground or many lichen culture. Under the same roof as the himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on the canvafs the promised hope of the Saysfl in the paradise of Mahomct, except that her eyes spoke too inundated for it to have been made to belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the montsairi, it would have been thought that the gaze was a poor type to her beauties; for who was haughting exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animal nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his sea after antiquities, and often the girl uncorisclous, engaged in the bone pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the beauty wbole of hcr form, floating as it was on the wind, your eyes greedy of bim, who forgot the letters that he came from decipiced on a nearly erased tablet, in the os contemplation his figure of sylph. Often, his braids would fall, as the same wilted around, exhibiting iri the ray of the sun so delicately bright and softly feeding drunks, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital import to the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why ottempt to describe characters that all the foel, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, overflowing with roams of drawing and stifling bullets. As he drew remains in the house of whinch, he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, in the tracing the scenes of her native placo; she would then describe him the circling dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, lunning to subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, would tell him all the supernaturai tales of her nurse. Her carnesty and her apparent belief, if what she was telling, aroused the iriterest even Aubrcy bone; and often as she told her the story of the living vain-pair, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, the year of the forced anger, by the ending on life af to Iovely female to take away her existence for the following months, her blood ran cold, while he began to laugh at such an idle and horrible fantasy; but Ianthe quoted her the names of the old men, who had found the last living between them, after several of her relatives and children had found the lamp of the appetite of their friend to be marked; and when she found it so incredulous, she begged him to believe, for it had been pointed out that those who had dared to see their existence, always bad proof of somo, incredulous, she begged him, with grief and heart, to confess. She stripped him of the trophic operance of these monsters, and the horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise descriptor of Lord Ruthuen; however, he still persisted on persuading the beer, that there could not be a truth in the horrible fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all made it possible to arouse a belief in Lord Ruthvens fupernative power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so confounded with all the affected virtues of the Amang women he had sought for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a deduced girl Greok, again he found himself increasingly attached to the almost magical form before him. He left him to timos, and, forming a plan for the somewhatantiquarian search, he left, dissuaded from not returning to his object was attired; but he still found it impossible to keep his attention on the ruins that surrounded him, weeping in his mind, he kept a shot-tunage alone the right possessor of his thoughts. Nathan has been a little crazy about her love, and has always been the same franc infinite like he knew the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favourites just had, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some fragments who had yet escaped the derisory time band. She had appealed to parents to be a subject of Vampyres, and the two, with several present, affirmed their existence, the pale horror of the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, because it had to pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, the flyer the day had closed, no no consideration. They described the resort of the vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most shocking evils as a manquant upori ham who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring test to mock a higher, insertial power, whose name even appeared to be back their blood gel, he was silent.\nThen Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his soul, and was worried to make fun of the fact that words-bis, mocking a house harumble friends, had inspired them by such a terror. When he was about to dope, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. It was, however, so busy in the search bis, that it did not perish that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, gather so quickly in a lemeric mass, and pour their rage upon the devoted country .— He finally mounted horse bis, however, determined to catch up by the speed for the delay bis: but it was too late. The twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; the sun sets, the night begins; and he had gone far, the power of the storm was above – his thundors echo had barely an interval of rcst – his thick heavy rclin forced his way through the conopier foliage, while the blue forked flash vulinod to fall and graduate at his feet itself. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the dazzling of lightning, that he was in the neighbour of a hovel that bardened from the dead rnasses of leclves of the wood of arid brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one for the handler in the city, or at least confident to get a shelter against the coat of the star. He barely approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shrieks of a woman who mingled with suffocated laughter, laughed at each other, continued in an almost venbroken sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that agonized on his head high, he, with a sudden effort, seized the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness; the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; sorry, though called her, the sounds still continued, and nothing was noticed of him. He sows himself in contact with someone whom he seizes himself; when a voice screams ,\" Always flouted !\" He felt overwhelmed by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: he soaked life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in uain: he was left from his feet and threw with enormous force against the grurid :— the enemy bis fought over him, and knelt on his chest, held laid his hands up his throat — when the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;— he immediately rose up, arid, soothing his prey, rushed through the door, and at the time the crashing of the braris, as he broke the wood, was rio along heard. The storm of Tobe was now extinguished; and Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble straw was loaded on any individual straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubreys desire, she was sought away from her, who had drawn her shouts; he was again left in darkness; but what was her husband, when the light of the torches burst on the bim, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought to Japan a life. He closed his eyes, hoping that he would begin a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the shape of the space, when he did not close the beam, stretchod by his side. There was no colour above his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a pensity about his thal focus seemed almost as endearing as the life that once lived there :— on the ber neck and chest was blood, and upon his throat was the marks of teelh having opened the vein :— to this the inner pointed, weeping, struck simultaneously with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A waf of litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of such brilliant and fair visions, now fermented with the flower life that had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were — his mind was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he led almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger bone, a particle building, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parts that had been erected in search of her that a mother had missed. Their loathsome cry, as they approached the city, warned of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the pain of their child, it is impossible to describe it; but they have checked the cause of their child's death, they have looked at the fever, and pointed at Corsica .\" They were inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a fever of the most violent, and was often of theirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe – by an incompetent communication he began to beg his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he imprecato curses upon his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, stunned at this time to arrive in Athens, and, for any reason, after hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately places himself in the same house, and becomes his constant companion. When he recovered from the delirium bis, he horrified and surprised himself with the view that he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rutbven, by bis genre words, involving almost repenclence sor the fault had caused their separation, and even more so by attentiveness, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence of hls. His seigneury seemed to change from quinquel; he no longer appreciated this apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his recovery began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey could not depart from the old, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of rejoicing playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this srine him cannot. During the most difficult stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently obstinate to look at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to obscure the progress of these orbs,circling, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to strangle the eye of all.\nAubrey's mind, by its shock, was much weaker, and this elasticity of the mind that had once so distinguished him now seemed to have dropped forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; bold as long as he wanted sollude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the middle of the ruiris he had previously attended, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if they were looking for him in the woods, his long feet would seem warrior on the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; tuna suddenly turning around, would show, your wild imagination, his pale face and wounded lhroat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which created so bitter assailations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he holds him bound by the college lender whom he had taken from China during his illness, that they should live with those parts of the Greee neighbor had seen again. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place where reprint clings; but they hadtened in this way to go from one place to another, but they did not seem to hold what they were looking at. They heard many robbers ,6 but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined only this inuentior of individuals, whose interest was to exterminate the generosity of those that they defended from claimed dangers. As a result, neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on an accassion, they traveled with only some guides, more to serve as guides than as a defenco. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had the reason to repent of their negligence; if they were barely the part engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistling of the closed bullets at their head, and by the echo report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards were afraid to have them, and by placing themselves under the behind rocks, they started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven on Aubrey, imitating their exainple, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering from defilement: hut shameful to be tbus detiried by an enemy, who, with inseparable cries, told them advonce, being exposed to the insistible girl, is one of the thieves who could ride above and take the tbe to the back, they determined both lo rvsh before in search of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, in addition to taking into account the help or his own peril, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having been wounded at the top by Lord Ru, then, thrown immediately into their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey saon encouraged them to transport his wounded friend to the nearby hut; and having accepted the ransom of cl, who was no longer troubled by their presence — they were content to keep the entranée until their comrade came back with the promised sum, because he had an order. Lord Ruthenf the force quickly diminished; in two mortification days followed, and death seemed to be set in motion with hasty steps. The conduct and appearance had not changed; it seemed as unconscious of the pain as it had been of the objects around it: but towards the end of the last evening, the British spirit became obviously uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was inducod to offer his help with more than the usual sheath —\"Help yourself! You have saved me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my reading, I have taken into account the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? \"I need a little money ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need a little money, my life is gone. I can explain everything, but if you were to hide me, you know, my humor was fréo from the stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had long been unknown in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising him up with exulent violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by your natural fear, that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to a living being in any way, that which may happen, or whatever you do. \"The eyes seemed to burst out of the sheets of the hole ,\" I swear !\" said Avbrey ,\" he was running down his pillow, and was no longer breathing .\"\nAubrey rested, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his goal, a cold chill came upon him, as if the predatory feeling of something horrifying was waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body of Tbe, when a thief met him, and informed Hiin that he was no longer there, after having been transported by himself and comrade, at his retreat, to the pirinacle of a neighboring mountain, ancestor to a promise that had given bis lardship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that shaves after his death. Avbrey was astonished, and took the several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of either eorpse or clothes, although the rabbers swore that they were pointing ortho idical rock on which they had laid the hody. For some time, his mind was perplexed in subjects, but he returned to the trail, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had left with such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appearedryly conspired to increase the superstitious real encycloy who had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he occupied himself by arranging the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case contaminating several weapons of force, more or less ada test to ensure the detachment of this victim. There were daggers on Afghanistan. As he examined their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently or named in the same style as the daggor discovered in the fatal hut – he trembled – rushing to get more evidence, he turned the weapon, and his horror could be imagined when he discovered that she was bleeding, particularly shaped, the sheath he had in his hand. His eye did not seem to need another certainty: they sawmod looking to be bound to the dagger; however, he began not to believe; but the particular shape, that is, the same shades on the shaft and the sheath is Werc in the splendor on both, and probably left the root far away; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and one of his ways back to Rome, his first investigations were the coricomania of the lady whom he had tried to rip out the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their forlune arrived, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's brain almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to another destroyer. He begged a morose arid silent; and his only job was to overcome the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; and a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon taunted him on the English shores; and he rushed into the house of his fathers, and there, for a Millel, seemed to lose, in the shades and carrots of his sister, all the memory of the leg. If before, through her infallible ears, she gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey did not have this winning grace that gaggens the gaze and opposes the salon assemblies. There was no of this slight shine which exists only in the heated atmosphere of a cold apartment. His blue eye was lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to depart from the misfortune, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate a bad conscience of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, that he went astray where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was sedalo and pensive. When alone, his face was never brilliantly brilliantly brillianced by the smile of joy; but who opened his affection to him, and who iri bear presence would forget these details. She knows that he destroyed his rest, who could have exhausted his smile for the vocabulary? It seemed that these eyes — the face was then playing in the light of their own sphere. She was still only a sting, and had not been...\nIndeed, the grandmas were more able to delay his presentation until his brother returned, while he could be a prailleur. It was therefore not resolved that the right lounge, which was fast approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey ralhcr bave would remain in his father's house, and feed on the melancholy that covered him. He was not afraid to get bogged down in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the mind had been so torn apart by the such events; but to be determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his father. They soon arrived in town, and pro-\nFor the next day, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive: a riot had taken place for a long time, and all those who threw themselves in the smile of the kingship were hastening. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he stood in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven works in that same place — he felt that he was only gripped by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded like this ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would blow up this, which he perceived, at a bit of distonne, the same failure that had drawn his attention to this place on his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry blood, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forced a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and fixed his barrids up his head, just like he was afraid his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath .— He woke up himself, he could not believe it possible — to be resurrected dead !— He thought his imagination had sung away the spirit of the magic bis was based on. It was impossible for him to be real — he determined, therefore, to return to society instead; for tough, he tried to ask for the worried Lord Ruthven, the name hung on the hif lips, and he could not fright himself in the cheerful information. He left a few nights after putting his sister at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated to a recreation, and then he led himself to his eating thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he fled, and entered another room, and found his sister overcome by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, who, asking her to move, turned around, arid revealed to him the traits which he abhorred. He went forward, said his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her towards the edge: the door which he found obstructed by the crowd of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was passing through them, he heard again the voice of that whispering near him :\"Remember your oath !\"\"Ho dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, Saon came to him.\nThe Authority has become almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a sufferer, how much more completely he was overwhelmed, now than the certainty of the life of the monster again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. Hisoath was astonished at himself ;— was he then allowed this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of Oll, he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His very sister had been hit by Bim. But even if he broke his oath, and described his supplications, who would believe him? He tried to use his own heel to free the world from such a misery; but the teeth, remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in the state; he closed his room, he saw only one, and he ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his score, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stilitude and madness. He left home, wandered from the street to slreet, anxious to steal this irritating which haunted the hive. His become canceled dress, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midday humidity. He was no longer so that he could recognize him; at first he took refuge in the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he had fallen over him. His sister, anxious for his possessions, employed people who followed him; but they were far away by him, who was moving away from a scholarship pursuing, from all thought. His driver, however, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea that he left by his absence, one of his friends, with a friend among the ins, of which the president they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into the priesthood, set in close watch, anxious in advance, despite his oath, all whom Lord Ruthven approached intimay. But when he entered a room, his hamburger and discontented eyes were so striking, his irritations were so visible, that his sister was obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the remaricce provod uriavailing, the gvardians thought appropriate to interpose, and, fear that the spirit of that was encomir alieried, they tangbt it high time to resuer agairi this truth that had been before irnposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nChallenged to save the hive from the wounds and sufferings that he had encountered in his wanderings, and which prevented him from exposing to the geriatric eye these marks of what they would oonside madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the dung, and take care of him oorist. He hardly seemed to riot him, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was given the chamber. He would lie for the days, unable to be awake. He had become moved, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier ;— the sign only of affixion and recolle remaining appeared at the entrance of the hif sister; then he sometimes began, and, siziring his hands, with the appearances that severely afflicted, he wanted her not to languish. \"Oh, not touching, is your love for me great, don't come near a blm !\" When, however, who asked whom he was speaking to, his only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And once again, he sank in a state, when he could even wake him up. This lastod inonths rnany: graduated, however, as the lover passed, hif inaherences he became less frequent, and bis mirid jeta lost part of his morosity, while his guardobserved, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then sinile.\nThe time had rarely passed, when, on the last day of the ear, an one of her gvardians entering her room, began to conv ero with her doctor on the meancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in a terrible situation, when her sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this brand of retuming iritellect, of which that they feared he had a bad human private, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to the sister dry bis. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He apparently agonizes the bright capale affected by the influence of his first smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, slowing down his brother's thought of being once again alive at the attention of the sanctities. He began to speak with all his warmth wonled, and congratulated his voice hermarriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and performance of evory; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; and pening it, what was his surprise to cash in the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled under foot. On her asking why he thus destroyed the re-emergence of a future husband, he looked as if he had not underestimated her — then by grabbing her heels, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of dimension, he told her to swear that she would never marry that monster, because he could not move forward — he saw if the voice asked her to remember his oath again — he suddenly turned around, thirirking Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the management of the guards and the physiclan, who had heard the whole, and that it was only the return of his trouble, entered, and prohibited her from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave retirement. He fell on his troubles with them, he begged, he took them away to delay them, but for a day. They, attributing this to the imaginary madness which had taken possession of his mind, tried to pacify him, and rotated.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had refused Béori with all the others. That he heard the sick of Aubrey, whom he willingly kept to be the cause; and when he learned that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had acquired this training. He hastened to the love of his former companion, arid, by the constant atteridaric, and the pretension of great affection for the brother and interest in destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangerous and toils to get up—could speak of himself as an individual with no sympathy for any ringing on the crowded atrium, except with her to whom to address ;— could be told. how, since he knows her, his existence, he began to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his effects. The title of the elder bronoh feeling for him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state ), which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked him for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjugating her, as she valued her own happiness, bent her honor, and the honor of those who are now in the tomb, which held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for a few hours this marriage, on which he stripped the heavy mast. The serrants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought he would bet that he would no longer harass Miss A brother's mind by, what he considered, greasing a maniac. Night passed some order without reply to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be more easily conccinated than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the Cuslodia bone, a powerless woman. How seized the opportunity, if one was bound out of the kingdom, and in a mountain fell himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approved himself without bounds, and, taking his arm by force, cast him out of the chamber, speechless with the race. On the stairs of Tbe, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if ever my fiancée no day, your sister is dishonored. Women are frail !\" Thus, he pushed HLM to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage not finding a uerite, had broken blaodlessly, and it was transmitted to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nAubreys weakness increases; bloodshed produces symlomas of the near-death approach. He wanted to be called the Guclrdians of his fisher, and when the hour of midnight had been beaten, to repeat in a composite way that the reader of Tbe had believed, and that he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect the Mifs Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared. Aubrey's sister had slipped her thirst for the cold VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT DF SEIGNOR BYRONS RESIDENCE, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, on the edge of Her Majesty Island, in the year 1822, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of Tbe of that name. The beauty of this arid place, some supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, leads many British vessels to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, just bonts largely repay for the deviation of a voyage. We disembarked; as usual, the bay bottom, and while the mcn were used to water, and the shipowner negotiated for cattle with the natives, the clergy. and I took an article for Ibe cove called Homers School, and other pieces, where we had been besieged. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Grecas our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who for fear that the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he would have taken me with him; but I dared not to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. Tbo cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old husband in charge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zecbins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not contributing; because he sank in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account excited about our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose any time in haste the house where our country had resided. We carried kindly received by an old man, who led us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: entrance hall, a drawer room, a sitting living room, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet annexed. They were all decorated in a simplified way: green walls, marble lables on either side, myrtle largo in the corner, and a small henath suntan, which could be made to play the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a dozen children of English cane, read an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The table bedroom had only a great maltress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a common bed pillow — throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the enclosure: it was open, but we did not think because it was justified by examining the content. On the tablet of the recesf were Voltaire, Shakfpearef, Boileau, and Rousseau complete works; the ruins of Volney's of Empjres; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an edition of Italjan, printed at Parina in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantjnople, mucb tom, but no book in English of any description. Most of these books were filled with notes of bologol with, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Mexican was literally scratched all the way, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also noted.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he went away, and he placed them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he surrenders; for he is so particular, that if I move a blow without order, he would be frowning on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I have once done a service; I have the product of this weapon for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty techniques which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the world, and which the lord brought here from Adrionople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble piles flanked with black plinths and fret work cornicks (as it is now usual in the Greek architect ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, under the awning area of strong coarse linen. Most shoals are furnished with buses, because the greens spend their evenings on smoking, light wines to drink, like \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and taking advantage of the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the tho huso, a small creek glissa, the grapes, oranges and lime gathering on its borders, and under the shade of lorgc myrtle bushes, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, crying, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view from this seat was what perhaps called \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, a cave of olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek tempio appeared in majestic decay. A small storm from the ruins descends into the castle.\nAdes, until he was lost in the woods near the mountain base. The sea smoolh in the form of glass, and a horlzon not shot by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little left, through a vista of loftychesnut and palm trees, sevcrallpetits islarides were distinctly observed, establishing the light blue wave welth spots of emerald Greek. I rarely enjoyed a view more than what I did; but our enquirios were fruiterless as to the name of the person Tbc who had resided in this romantic soljtude: no one knew his name but Domi nick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our corid author ,\" could say so, but I sure he wouldn't,\" he said ,\"carinot your old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We have not much time to live up to Armenian, but our return to the city, we have learned several details of the secluded lord. He had shared the young girls who were the last on the island, and always danced with them at the wedding party of Tbe. He gave a cow to a man, borrows to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who got lost in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he corresponded to us, from all that we collected, also were a very eccentric and caring character. One circumstance we have learned that our old friend at college tangbt own not to disclose- Yes. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the horde of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him how to use it.\nSucb was the information with which we left the quiet island of Mitylene bone; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this crawler at Greeoe could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the disposition of philanthropy, and all those eccentricities that nark a peculiar genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"Tbe individual,\" he said ,\"out of which yau are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the Tbe island of Tenedos, and I also visited a bim in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the resource of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we not regress without having been more urious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day would never come back. I render this state of mind, by improving it not entirely intolerant, and in court in the good name of his secretary, which was grossly clumsy. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be plainly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the singers' feelings have the heart, so elegantly portrayed in Lordship poems, seems to have been sitting in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions: arid his courteousness, the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being on whose heart, the Hatb religion sealed his, and ovor whose head Volunteer has thrown his coat. No man can read the pleasant \"truists\" before, feeling proud of him as an emissary. As far as the half likes or pleads, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The report must always be lucid, especially when it is directed against man's intergrile moral; and whoever dares to justify himself before a horrible trihunal whore appears, only can censor the orres of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart on a self-approved conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Sleet.",
    "13": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it nat, however, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; and it has taken its present form only since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a body of Latiri could not break if it was buried in their territory, it increased graduated, and farmed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extinct, detho dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the fact just spread, with some variation of the mass, also on Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres almost soaked up some of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while the human blood suckers fattened it — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, in order to slow down the blood of all passages of their body, and even of the very porous lhc of their skins.\nIn the Journal of London, Marcb ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hungary. It seems that above a examination of the commander-in-chief and of the mogistrates of the place, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, abated five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arriold Paul, had been tormented by a vompyre, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of the vampyr grava, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from scorning a vain himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, people many complained of being tormented by a bim, and a statement was made, that four child people were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhclbitants have consulted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found (os is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely srees from corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose, ears, clnd, pure and flood blood. As the evidence was retained, they resorted to the sophisticated remedy. A stake was led by Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been olive. It did, they ripped off his head, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grove. The same measures were adopted for those who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become open agents of others who survived them.\nUniversal belief just, that a person sucked by a manufacturer himself generates a vainpyrc, and sucks in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here. There are better indications to illustrate the subject of observatories of the present than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to limit his infernal ausitation to beings whom he most praised on earth – those to boast that he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A suppofition refers to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn to pieces, and shall haunt the place of natjvo, and suck the blood of all thy seed: there thy daughter, and thy wife, shall drain the stream of life by midnight; yet the rust of the banquet that persecutes shall feed thy living corsus, Thy victims, They shall expire, they shall know the devil for their sire; as the cursing thco, and Tbou curse them, thy flowers shall be sown on the stem. But a man for your crime falls, the youngest, the best loved of all, will bless you with the name of a father: Your word will envelop your heart! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of the eye, and the last glazed glance that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with an unhumiliated hand will tear the braids of yellow blue hair, of which, in life, a padlock when the deep pledge of affection has been carried — but now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood shall flow; the tooth shall be gnclsing, and the lip shall be set on hold; and after the tomb shall go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror shall depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr Southey also translated in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having come back from the grave for the purpose to torment him that she loved better when it exists-\nThat is right. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sin of her first, she is being rottrayod through the whole tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The true Taurnefort gives a long account of his journeys of several clever cases of vamp yrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this sub-I ct, besides a variety of oncdotes, and traditional accounts illustivo of his effects, he presented some dissertatioris leamed, tending to prove that he is a classic, as well as the Borbarian error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions on this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present can substitute for the imiles of a note, neo-testerously devoted to explanatiori, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are sooveral other synonyms with lt, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThings have happened in the independence of the dissident.\nOn a London winter, the leaders of the town appeared to the various parties, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. He looked up, the mirror surrounded him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted its attention, so that it could by a glance stifle it, and cast fear into those breasts where the infidels reigned. Thus, who felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where it darkened: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce inside the works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a loaded ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities made him be invited to each house; all wanted to see him, and those who flouted the habit of violating the excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were pleaded to have something in their presence capable of committing their intention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never won a warinerint, eilher of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many women hunters after notaricty tried to gain her attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what might end up affecting: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all shewri monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, pierced himself in his manner, and everything except put on the dress of a morit bank, to attract her attention :— but in vain :— when she stood in front of him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, still he saw as if they were not pierced ;— even her unapplaused impudder was flouted, and she left the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of her eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to her: however, which was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman about the innocent girl, that few know that he never joined women. He had, however, the reproduction of a winning language; and if it was even that he caused the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his hatred appeared to be the vice, he was also often among those women who somehow boast their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shudder her by vices later.\nAt about the same time, a young gentleman from Aubrey's rame arrived in London: to be a person 1ft with a sister only in possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also to climb by the guards, who thought that it was duly meroly to take caro of his fortune, while they resold the more important charge of bis mlrid to the carc of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. So he had this great romantic quarrel of horror and frankness, which every day ruins so many fears of millions. He believed that it was a symptomatology with virtue, and that the vice was chained by Providence for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he said that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and small-coloured patches. He thought, in the field, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay waxes, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their favourites languisbants or grotesques: the daugbters at the same time, by their brigbing confluences as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he operated his lips, soon led him to the notions of madness of his talents clinging to his merit. Attached to cls he was to the love of his salaried hours, it started to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that freaked, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the warning of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for the clny of these congreries of pleasant pies and descriptions c0 held in these volumes, of whom he had formed his studies. By finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up dreams, when the extraordinary trouble being we described above, he hurried him in his career.\nHe looked at it; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, thari taclt enslaved to their existence nee, implicitly avoiding their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine each thing that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of a romance, and decided to observe the afasance of his fantasy, rabbling thari the person the before. He became known to him, paid him for slitting, and so far attached to his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon sounded, from the prayer notes on the street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to gain a little information about this singular character, which, until now, had made its curriosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to execute the tower, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice in order to put themselves on equality with the elderly, and not to allow the larn to apprehend as if fallen from heavens, venture intrigues scandalous are begden as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skin sown by wearing them. And Aubrey, immediately speaking about his intentions to Lord Rulhven, was surprised to ask him to join him. Tired by such a mark of esteem on the part of him, who, apparently, had nothing to coinmori with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a time of birds they passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Robert, and now he has found that about much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent reasons for his conduct. His composition was proved in his liberality ;— the idol, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to revive the immedate desires. But Aubrecy could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the vultuous, reduced to indignation by the dishonest assistants of virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the proligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. There, the charity of his Lordship, which was more impressed by his spirit, proved inevitable for those on whom it was granted, because they were led to scaffolding, or sunk into the lowest and most abject misery. In Brusfels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the ardour with which his companion sought the counters of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in all the spirit of the table of Faro: he bctted, arid always won with success, except where the best known was his aritagonist, and he lost even more than he won; but he was still with the exchangeface samo, with which he generally looked at society around: he was not, however, his when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the ind was spread, and his eyes shone with more fire than the that of the cat that fell with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, he left the former rich young child, torn from the oircle which he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a donjori, the fate had drawn him to the reach of this fund; while reny a fathor sal frantjc, arnidst the eyes scattered from mute children hurigry, without a single farming of his last immense wealth, where he even bought enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table game; but immediately lost, in the ruirier of Nancy, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the innocent: it might be that the reverence of a degree of certain knowledge, which, however, was not able to fight the trick of the most experienced ced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this beggar and beggar who proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he got a greater gratification of it than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break that mystery, which his excluded imagination began to assure the appearance of some supernatural.\nThey came to Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his brief companion; he left him in daily joy in the morning circle of the Italian Countess, while he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. What, then, was there letters that came from England that he opened impatiently; the tree came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonishing hjm; has it already entered into his imagination that there was evil power in his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seize his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible seducution powers made bi-firing habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his content for adultery had not been generated by hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, despite his gratification, that bis victim, tho partor of his guilt, should be hurlcd from the pinacle of unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of irifamy and degradation: in the end, that all thososo females whom had sought, apparently because of their virtue, evil, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed all the defunctness of their vices to the pubic gaze.\nAbbrecy determined the uporliving, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous ori point, tearing the eye. He responds to invents a bit of pretty assimilable to abander it in the altogotber, purposing, in the way, to look closer, bim, and not to let pass any slight irconstances by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soori perceivod that his seigneury was eridvorous to work on the inexperience of the Iady donut of which he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, she is a single woman who mixes with society; he is obliged to pursue his projects in secret; but Aubreys eye dazzled him in his windigrees, and soori discovered that an assigration had been designated, which would probably end in the origin of an innocent, Tangb without a girl thought. Without losing any lime, he entered Lord Ruthvens applause, and tirelessly asked him for his intentions, which he took back from the lady, at the same time informing him that he was aware of his desire to meet her that evening. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he put a call would have on such an occasion; and after having been pressed if he read to marry her, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, writing a riot, to say, that from that time on, he had to refuse to aspire to his Lordship in the reininder of the proposed leader, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and callilig on the lady's mother, informed him of the Il ho kncw, not only would see his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Rutbuen the next day simply sent a high-service to notify a separation of his full consent; bvt did not suggest any suspicion of his plans being thwarted by Aubrey interposllion.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and found himself in Athens. Hc then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the documents filled of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freedom only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering soil or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so kind and delicate, that she could form fashion 1 for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mahoinetf, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for Italy one to think that she could belong to these wobs had no souls. As she danced in the plain, or tripped along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eyes, appears the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal follows but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ionthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaso of him, who stuffed the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in the contemplation of a hor sylph-like figure. Often, his braids would flirt, like she flitted around, expose in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly erase booef, he might excuse blue oblivfulnefs of the antiquarian y, but let escape brake his mind the very object that he had before tho-\nThis is a passage of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Portuguese. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded ants and stifling balls. As he drew the remains of which he wished to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, sweeping the magic effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the circular dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered having seen his childhood; and then, turning to subjects which, obviously, made a greater eruption on his mind, told him all the adrenalal tale of his laugh. It is often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and which had confined herself last year to feeding herself with a sweet madness to prolong her months of oxidence, the blood of bis would cool down, while he attached himself to such fantasies and horrible fantasies; bull Ianthe quoted her the dwarfs of old men, who had at last detected a living manga lhemselves, astering several bones of their relatives relatius and their children, found marked by the stamp of the appetite of their friend; and when she sounded so inordinate, she begged him to believe it, because he had noticed that those who had degued to question their existence had always had true evidence, and had given him assurance. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was amplifying, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthveri; he, comments r, slill, persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to nature; innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari without instruction, Greek daughter, the silt was sounded so more and more attached to the form almost falry before him. He will sometimes tear it out of her, and, forming a plan for the search for the antiques of the orne, he will leave, decided not at a retum until his object will arrive; but he always found it impossible to repair his atte-\nIn his mind, he kept an image which seemed to be the only rightful teacher of his thousand. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the frank infantile smile that he had known for the first time. She seemed reluctant to separate from the hive; but it was because she no longer had one mind that she could visit her favorite haunts, but the witch guardian was busy skotching or undoing a fragment that had still wiped out the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present several, affirmed their existence, the pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; that they heard the name of the plaque, that they all at once harassed him not to turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through the wood, where no Groek would never remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal forces, and denounced the evils of moft hairy as imminent on him that dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them shoulder at his darling so to mock the superior, infernal power, whose dwarf even apparently shook the blood, he silenced himself.\nThen he informed Aubrey's ensemble on his unparticipated tour; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such terrors. When he was about to leave, Nathan came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, and the night was over, which allowed the power of these bells to be put into action. — He promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that day-light soon fine, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, gather so quickly in the mass of atremendous, and pour all their rage upon the devoted country .— He, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for the hif delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climatos, is almost bare; immediately the seven sets, the night begins; and it has had advanced.\nThe power of the storm was above, its thunder echoes had a little rest interval, for heavy and thick rains forced its passage through the solilage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse rushed, and he carried with a terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped through the fotigue, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that hardly rose over from the masses of dead hares and brushwood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to be confident to get a heart from the eruption of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a morning silence, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with the whirlwind, the exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost non-bro keri sound ;— he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that agairi walked on his head, he, with a sudden eff-\nOrt, the witches operate the door of the house. He weakens the darkness of the ostrich; however, the smile of the guida. He was apparently unwise; for, tangb he called, still. the sounds have continued, and no opinion has been taken like him. He found himself in contact with a sorno, which he immediately seized; when the police shouted ,\"Always floundered !\" And he felt fluctuated by him whose strength seemed superhuman; and he decided to sell his life as hard as he could, and he wrestled; but it was invaded; and he was lifted up from his arid, hurled with amazement against him. the earth :— his company fell upon him, and knelt on his panties, had placed his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many penestral torches through the hole that gave light in the day had troubled him ;— he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rolled through the door, and at the moment the branches of the twisting bone, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was no longer there; and Aubrey, who was not able to move, was soon heard by those who had none. They entered, and the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the ball loaded on every industrial straw with heavy soft flakes. At the fire of Aubrey, they sought the one who had attracted him to his cry; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches ordained him more first on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor in a lifely Corsica. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a visitor coming from this disturbed the imagination; but he saw again the shape of a sarne, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no calorie on the cheek, not even his lip, but there was a silence on his face that seemed as alinotic as the life that once inhabited her :— at the top of his neck and chest was blood, and at the top of his throat were the marks of teeth that opied the vein :— at this time the men pointed, shouted, at the same time struck with horror ,\" To Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was formed in general, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the hcr which had recently been at hjm the bone object so many luminous versions and fajry, now fallen with the thal of life of the flower of had died in it. He did not know what the thoughts of bis were — his reindeer was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacclncy — he unconsciously held the olinost in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular correction, which had been mad and in the hut. They were quickly met by different parties who were wrongly engaged in the investigation of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" It would be impossible to harden their grief; a hurt, when they discovered the cause of the child's death, looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolable; but died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was sejzed with a more violent sever, arid walls often delirlous; in these iritéruels he could call Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination, it seemed lomen of his forepanion to hatch the being he loved. In another time, he permeated the curses on his pearl, and cursed him as his dowry. Lord Ruthven, staggered at this time, also arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing the bone state Aubrey, immeasurably placed in the same house, and begging his attendant. When the latter recovered from the liquor bis, he was horrified and fermented at the sight of the one whom he had now combined with that of aornpyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving the greatest repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, oridism, he showed, soon re-enacted to his presence. His secretary seemed quite shaken; he no longer appeared in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference from the old man, except that he was sometimes surprised at your encounter with his game staring at him, with a malicious smile of exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage, after the restoration of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook with great apprehension to observe the madness waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these words, turning, like our world, still sven ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the oycs of all.\nAubreys spirit, by the shock of this, was greatly weakened, and this elastic spirit that had so distinguished him now seemed to be running away forever. He was today like a lover of solitude and silence like Lord Rulhven; but although he wanted him, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he could hear him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the words, his small step would be apparently wandering in the middle of the undcrwood, in the quest for the modest purple; lhon suddenly turned around, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale faceo and his wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, all the seams of which he had the bitter spirit assooialions iri. He prophesied to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during his illness, so that they would not visit the those parts of Greece and that they did not yet have so much. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for every place to which a memory could be attached: but although they rushed so-\nThey looked like they were doing what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they began to take advantage of these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of the individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from the preterized dclangers. In consequence, not to take into account the advice of the inhabitants, they once travelled with only a few guards, make to throw themselves as guides only as defence. When entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks at the bottom of the neighboring practice, they had a reason to repeat their negligence; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle bullets of near their head, and by echoed several cannons. In an accident, their guards had left them, engulfed, placing themselves hehirid rocks, bad started to shoot in the direction that the TBE report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, are tired for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement:bul shame of bellg thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, bade them advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers would have to climb up and take them to the rear, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthvon received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to the basic assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised when he saw the faces of the robbers around him — the guards hastened, on the wounded of Lard Ruthven, immediately threw down their arms and surrided themselves.\nBy the promise of a great reward, Aubrey soon forced them to corrupt his wounded friend in a neighborhood hut; and, by agreeing on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence of a bird – they simply kept the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased rapidly; in two days mortificationensued, the arid death seen advertising with hasty stops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like an unconscious of pain class. he had been of the object about him: but to say the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently unoasy, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was industrialized to loosen his assistantclnco with mare that usual solicitude —\"Assist mc! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I take into account the death of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little of my life flourishes, I cannot explain the whole. If you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had not been known for some time in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence :\"Scarby all your soul treasures, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or of the death of any living being, in any way whatsoever, or of what you can see .\" \"His eyes seemed to burst out of their slippers :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was laughing on his pillow, and did not breathe a mare.\nAubrey connected the rest, but he was asleep rioting; many circumstancos assisted his knowledge-\nAnd he arose with this man, and knew not why; and when he swore, there trembled a machine upon him, as though he came from the present of something terrible that was awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole into which he had left the corpse, when cl Robber met him, and informed him that it was not dangerous there, having transported by himself and comrades, at his retreat, to the pinaole of a mountain nelghbouring, according to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the coldest ray of the moon that flaked his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the souvenir of men, determined to go and bury him up from where he was. But when he went up to the Suinmit, he had no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would pee on the same rock on which Ibey had laid the body. For his mind, he was stunned in conjectures, but finally back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspiracy to increase that superstitious melancholy total had seized on his mind, he decided to leave her, and the foon arrived at Smyrncl. While he was waging lamentations for a ship to transport him to Otrarito or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Steven. Among other things, there was a case containing sevorous weapons of offence, more or less adaptation to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an tame sheath in the style of celebrity like the dclgger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — having rushed to get other evidence, he found the weapon, the arid horror bis can be imagined when he discovered that it corresponded, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: the teeth seeing to get angry at the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the shades of samo varying on the haft and sheath were similar in the lender sp on both, and lofl without room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe feared that Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were on the lady which had ottempted to snatch the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of it since the dowry of her secretary. Aubrey spirit became almost shattered. after so many horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to rush the speed of the positions, as if he were going to show the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a hreezc, who seemed obedient to his will, a foon swollen bim on the English coast; and he hastened to the monsion of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infertile caresses, had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear to, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey doesn't have this winning grace that wins the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no of this brilliantity which light only exists in the atmosphere of the litter of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a meloncholy charm on this subject which did not seem to come from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a soul conscious of a brighter mind. His step was a riot that could be attracted by a butterfly or a color – it was sedative and pensive. When alone, her face was never brilliantly shaken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and in her presence she would have relieved those sorrows that she knew to destroy her roste, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seems that these eyes—the face of the lock was then sinking into the legion of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and bad, did not appear in the world, because she had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he could have his protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be the time when she was trying in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the region of his fathers, and fed myself who surpassed him. He could not feel the frivolities of the fashionable strarigers, when her mind had been so torn by the avont she had wilnesfed; but he decided to sacrifice her own comfort to the proteclion of her sister. They soon arrived in Towri, and prepared for the next room, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship smile, hastened to the tbitter. Aubrey was there with her sister. While standing in a corner by the Heifels, without taking into account all that was around him, elongated in the reincarnation that the first time we had seen Lord Ruthuen was in the same place, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a way that he recognized well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He has little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that haunted him, when he perceived, in a distance little, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his legs, most refusing to wear the weight of the thorium, was forced to take a sling on his arm off, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, set in the house. Ho pacod the rooin with horrible steps, and staring his hands on his hood, as if he feared his thoughts were hurt from his brain. Lord Reveri again before him —circumstances sta-\nHe woke up himself, who couldn't rock him, the riso dead again !\" He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; although he managed to ask about Lord Ruthuen, the name hung on his lips, and he could succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister at the donkey of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he took off the joint for a break, and here he gave himself his own devouring purchases. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he went away, entered another room, quadrified his sister surrounded by several, apparently in serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a shuddering step, forced her to say the tear: at the door he was kindled by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, he heard again this voice whispering by him :«Remember your oath !\" He dared to turn, but, pressing, sister, he came to the house.\nAubreys almost distorted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on his thoughts. Her sisters' attentists were no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited him to explain to her what had dared her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more we bought it, the more disoriented it was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this dear torurre, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? He could touch his sieve. But even if he violated his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. He remained in this state for a few days; locked in his room, he saw only one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes trodden with tears, begged him, for his own good, to support nausea. Finally, being no longer able to carry calm and solude, he left his house, wandering street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, afraid to be wandering, the bone often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; first he re-tubated with in the evening at his house; but finally he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue and took him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people for the follow; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pressure faster than any — from thought. However, his conduct changed with the welder. Hit with the idea that he was afraid of his obsence all the friends of hif, with a friend amongst them, of the absence they were unconscious, he decided to engage again in society, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite his oh, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful arid eyes were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that the sister of this was finally obliged to beg HLM to refrain from seeking, for her, the society called that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the Canadians decided to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he had daily surrounded in his wandering legs, and to prevent him from exposing to the eye of the general traces of what they consider madness, they engaged a doctor to pass into the house, and to throw away his tough ear. He hardly noticed that there was really no spirit of a lerrable subject. His inconsistency is so great that he was entrusted to his chambermate. There would often lie for the days, unable to be awake. He had fainted, his eyes looked like a lustrous chandelier; there were only signs of affection and remembrance left on his sister's entrance; then he would begin at hometimes, and, taking hold of his hands, with looks that sevorously afflicted hor, he wished hor nat to praise him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if you love me, don't come near him !\" When, blindly, Sbe asked whom he was speaking to, his only answer was :\"Truth! Travel !\" And once again, he sank in a state, because not even could wake him up. This lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year had passed, his inconsistencies became frequent, and his mind cast of a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the day he counted on his fingers, a definite riumber, arid and then smiling.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to talk with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of every being in such a terrible situation, when if the sister went the next day to be hammered. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of return to the intellect, they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in the solety, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by expressing his intention to be present on the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his fisher hit him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to at least her sixth, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought that her brother was once again alive to the feelings of the affétion. He began to speak with all the warmth of the gained bis, and to gather it on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion upon his chest;0 the while, what was his surprise to see the traits of the table of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled him on the under foot. On her asking him why he also destroyed the look of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a frantic expression of face, he told him to swear that she would not marry that annuitant, for he—but he could not move forward —he was able to sow as if this voyce repeated his oath to him —he suddenly fainted raun d, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but did not see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and physiciari, who had heard the whole, and who thought it was only a return of his trouble, entered, and forcing Bim from Miss Aubrey, desired that she leave Hiin. He fell on his pens to them, he begged, he begged them to get rid of themselves, but for the day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, had taken the passion of his mind, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had glued in the morning after the dredging room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he learned to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be confused with those among whom he had galvanized this information. He settled in the house of his former companion, and, by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, gradually rose up in Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dclngers and you 1 to tell — could say to himself as an individual having a rio sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with herself that he addressed himself ;— could know how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to be wary of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his oozing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch along it, he obtained a large mass, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed stote) which was to take place as the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor arid his guardians, began to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; he was given HLM; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she interpreted her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those now in the grave, which once held her in the arms of their as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which the heaviest curses were felt. The servants promised that they would deliver her; by overturning her, the physician, he thought that he would bet that he would no longer harass Miss Aubreys spirit by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. Night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of this house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be more easily bc designed than deformed, the notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew frantic almost. The curiosity of the servants finally came to their village, they graciously stole, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He was scaling the occasion, with the connected past, was out of the room, and in a moment I found hesels in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by the farce, rushed him out of the chamber of Tbe, sp-\nExercise with a rage. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his face r :\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not the day of my bride, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" Thus, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey does not have a lack of support himself; his rage did not find the vent, a bad broken blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. He was not entrusted to his sister, who was not present, whom he had on his back, because the doctor feared to actuate the beer. This marriage was celebrated, and the bride and husband left London.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted the guards of his sister to be cashed, and when the hour of midnight had its green light, he consistently resumed what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when he was arrested, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had made himself happy, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world began before him, went to the resting place of Choofehjs, and Providence its guide .\"\nBy sailing across the Greek archipelago, aboard Her Majestys ships, in the year 1812, we place into the barbour of Mitylene, on the island of this dwarf. The beauty of this placo, and the supply of certairi with cattle and vegetables that must always be found, led to many British ships to visit it, men of war and merchonline; and it is rather out of the rack for ships linked to Smyrne, its premiums largely reimburse the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the power negotiated for cattle with the nations, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and other places where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (smali mound so named) we met with and hired a young Greek as our guide, that told us to have come from Scia with an English lord, who left the jsland four precious mclys upon our arrival iri hls self-\nThat is right. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he took me with him; but I dared not to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He is weird, but he is a very good boy. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left it the old ari man: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( obo just L 250 English currency ), and recast there about fourteen months, but not confident; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account greatly exorbited our curiosity, we did not waste time at the hosting in the house where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old renan, who led us to the manor. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance room, a bathroom, a sitting living room and a bedroom, with a spacious and anxious closet. They were decorated in simplicity call: green walls, marbled tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play the bronebs by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had a large mattress lying on the bed floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the corn bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed cl rockcess marble, once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the cl large sailor chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think oursolves just licked in the oxaminant contained. On the tablet of Tbe, the ruins of the Empires of Voltajre, Shokspeare, Boileau and Rovsseau are finished; the ruins of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schillor of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlels of the Greek press in Canstantinople, torn ruch, but no English book of no description. Most of these books were filled with marital notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with a pile of paper, which were also remarks.\nThe old John said :\"The Lord had read these books the eternal grace he was navigating, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must go to his return; if he is his parliculclr, that is, I would move a thing without ordors, he would frown me for a week together; he is very good otherwise. I once had him a fever; and I hated the practicum of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who dwells in a single hut in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I know why .\"\nThe appearance of the external housely was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty paces, lang and fourteeri brocld, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work corniccs (as just is now usual in Greek architecture ), were curiderably higher than the reds. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine cherry carpet, under an awning of coarse linen strong. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the breeze to the evening.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens mingled on the edges, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with on the ornamental back w ooden, on which we said, the lord passed many of his vespers and nights until twelve ooclock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of his seat was what could be called \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich vineyards with an eye on Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle trees in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek lempet appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into brake cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; arid a little on the left, through a vista of high chestnuts and palm trees, several Sinall islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I had a more beautiful view than this one; but our research was unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solillude: no one knew his name, but Doininick, his banker, who had won in Canada. \"Tbe Armenian\" said our leader ,\" could tell, but I sure he won ,\"–\" And you say it to the cannol, old friend ?\" \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we searched for the details of the isolated Lord. He shared the eyes of the young girls when he was last on the island and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave an eel to the man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the daughters who were bound by wearing these articles. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, we appeared, from all that we collected, for having been a very eccentric and bony character. The courage of the circumstances that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate to reveal. He had a more beautiful daughter, with which one often saw the world walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him the case of it himself.\nThese were the information with which we expelled from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination.\nI think it is his rambling in Greece. Ho had money that he was an adult: he had a philanthropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr . FDSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said, about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels, a this island from Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been in our farm house for a few years; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in every pige. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curious in our research at that stage, but we have comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not quite uriinteresting, and in justice the good name of his secretary, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive decision, an averso to associate with the brulonne nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as can be clearly traced from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his seniory poems, seem to have fallen seated in his home. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and to remove his rest from solitude is an additional reason to mark him as being clear on whose heart, Religion has put his sea, and on whose head Benevolence cast her coat. No man has read the pleasant \"features\" of the preceding without feeling proud of him as a countryman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with water, in particular the where directed against the moral integrity of a mcln; and the one who dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make a secret bonin, arid shun that the world of applause, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart arid self-approval coriscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown-court, Fleet-Street.",
    "14": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it is common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which time, the increasingly widespread idea, beat a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it graduated and formed the subject of many wandering stories, existing still, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the thyg and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a few slight varatjori, al 1 on Hvngary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims at night, which were emaciated, lost their strength, and rapidly diod of consumption; while the human blood suckers tbese grasd—and the veins of tir bccame distend the state of repletion such as cause the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even to fill the very pores of the skins of jr.\nIn the London Journal, on March 1732, was a curious and, of course, credible among a particular case of vampyrism, which would have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they affirmed positively and unanimously that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arno told Paul, had been heard, that, called Cassovicl, on the fronts of the Turkish Service, had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a misfortune to get rid of the grieving, eating from the land of the vampy soin...\nHe is a grave, and rubs with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from seizing a vampyrc himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people coincided with being tormented by him, and a deposition was made, that four child porsoris were deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid any errors, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadangj, took the badger, and found it (as it supposed to be usual cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from corruption, and melting in the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and floridbload. Since Proaf was thus obtained, they rode to the Accuslomed remedy. A pole was completely led through Arriold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures as those adopted by thosososos who had previously died of vompyrisin, lest they become, like their turri, agents over others who survived them.\nThe universal belljef is that a person sucked by a vampyre itself becomes a vampyre, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that might be presented. In some parts of Greece, this is a kind of punishment after the death, for the odious somo criminal committed while in the oxistence, trot the deceased is not only brought to vampyrise, but has pushed to limit his infernal victuations only to those beings whom he loved the highest of the earth — those to that he was bound by tics of kinship and affection. — A supposition mentioned in \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corfe shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place, and sucking the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, Atmidnight draineth the stream of life; yet take away the banqvet that perseveres Mvs feed your livid, living corfe, your victims, are tbey yel, will know the devil for their sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, thy slows wilt on the stem. But he who, because of your crime, is to be kindled, the greatest beloved of all, will bless you in the spirit of the name of a father: This word shall engulf your earpiece in the flame. Yet you have a task to do and you have marked the last tink of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and his last glazed look must see which freezcs over his blue lifters; then, with a non-haled hand, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a wick of the thorn of Asfection has been worn, but now is carried by the Memorial of Thyagonia! But with the best blood shall flow; the tooth of gnachirig, and the lip of thug; then, hunting toward the sulten tomb, Go-arid with Gous and Afrits rave, until these things in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Soulhey bas also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire curse of the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having resumed the grave in order to torment him, loved will better in exile. But this cannot be supposed to make the sinner of her life resouler from, sbe being made the whole story as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true tournefort gives a long story in his lraves of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he preterizes to be an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on it was, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, traditional arid narratives illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nOne could add a lot of curious and interesting things on this superstition, which is very horrific; although the present self suffices for the limils of a note, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and which rnoy riow riow bc conclvd by merely pointing out that if the term Vampyre is that in normal general acceptance, there are several other synoryms with it, the madc use of various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happens that in the middle of the disasters accompanying a London writer, the different parties of the leaders of the ton appeared a noblemary, more remarkable for the singularities hjs, than the row bis. He looked at the gliding around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only its attraction, it could be by a laak level, and the fear of blowing in those breosts where the kindness reigned. Those who felt this sense of duty could not explain from where this itarose: orne attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, sitting on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to the pierce there.\nBut he fell on the cheek of a ray of the bow that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to go to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had assailed themselves to the violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were begged to have something in their preponderance that engaged the attention of them. In spite of the deadly horror of her face, which never got a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the strong bone emotion Possjon, her shape and exterior 1 were beautiful ,1 many female hunters after notoriety aspired to gain her attention, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been moc ery to every mansler dressed in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and threw himself everything except on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention :— although in vain :— when she slood before him, although his eyes had apparently flopped on that of her, it seemed that they had not seen each other ;— even her unhopeful impudence was strewn, and she left the field. Although adultery does not even influence the direction of his eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the vile woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to him himself to the semal. He had, however, the reputatiori af a winni ng torigue; and although it was even that he overcarnated the horrific character af hls chantvlar, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vico, he was also often among the thososo semals who formed the boast of their sex fred domestic virtues, as well as among those who shovel him by their vices.\nPart of the same shot, he came to London, a young gentleman named Aub Rey: he was an orphan left with a cell only sisler in the possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. For fear that he would attack himself by guards, who thought that it was only about taking care of his fortune, that they would abandon the most important burden of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high romantic feeling of honor, arid candour, whipping every day ruins so many learnings of millions. He was all to sympathize with the spiritual virtue, and thought that thal juice was thrown into Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the aromas: he thought that thal the misery of a more house consists of just the garment of canvases, which were warm af, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was dreadful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded the bims, obstructing things that had to describe with the least noise, their languishing or grumpy favourites: the naughty at the same time, by their enigmatic countenancics as he approached, and the gleaming eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of half of solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tailaw and the flanked wax candles, not of the present of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of photos and fold descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in a graceful bis vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we have above described, went through him in his career.\nHc dumped him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in the bimsclf, who gave a few other signs of his abservation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he formed this object into the hero of a romance, set in motion to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has advanced in his opinion, that his presence has been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the preparation notes, it — Street, realized that he was about to travel. Desiring to get some information about this singular character, which, until now, had only brandish his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for her to tour, which for many generations was considered necessary to unable the young love to take a few quick steps in the care of the vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous criticisms are lied as subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented; and Aubrey unequivocally evoking his intellects to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of bim, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he welcomed him with joy, and in a few days they had passed to uricling waters.\nSo far, Aubroy had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now to be far away, that, although many of his actions had been exposed to his point of view, the results would oscillate from the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from the hand of bis more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not notice that it is not about the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he gave his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely removed; but where the profligatecame to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to crush himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, has been attributed to greater importance, if the vicious, which usually prevails over the repugnant carelessness of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance obsessed with the charity of her Lordship, which was even more permeated on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all either leading to the scaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities where the past was located, Aubrey was surprised to the spirit with which his campaign sought the centres of all the fisbiable vices; there he entered into the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except when the known hunter was bis clnt-clgonist, then he lost even more thclri than he won; but it was always with the immutable fame fac, with which he gazed at society around: it was not, however, when he met the young Novlce eruption, or the chancellor father of a large family; then his very desire seemed weak forturia — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than the cat lhat while dilating with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left his youth formerly deafened, torn from the circle, blushing, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn bim wilhiri the reach of this friend; while mony a big frenetic sat, among the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his immense wealth fire, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he had no money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, he had just snacked from the corrosive take of the innocent: this could but be the result of a degree of certainty of knowledge, which was rioting, however, able to fight the running of more experienced tho. Aubrey wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from charity and plea that proved the ruin of all, and did not have his own profit; he dclayed-for every day he bopod his friend gives him an opportunity to harvest frankly and openly to hiin; commenter, he never happened. Lord Ruthven iri, his car, and the wild and rich scenes of nature, were always the same: bis eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no gratification more groat of him than the consternation of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exaltation began to assume the appearance of the same supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey foresaw the time 1st seen from his companion; he left him in the daily clendency in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memorials of the almost naked another city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only the affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had been besieged in his organization only there was a bad pagan residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reasons for belief. His guards insisted that he inevitably left his friend, clrid vrged that the bis character was terribly curious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to silk. He had been disdained, that his consecration for the odultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, partner of his guilt, scrambled the pinccle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, that all the snails which ho had sought, apparently because of their future, hod, Sirice his departure, even threw the mask, and had not relieved to expose all the deformation of their vices in the eyes of the publication.\nAubrey determined up to one living oria, whose character had not yet shown a single point of brigbt on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning another hjm, seeking, in the middle while, to monitor him more closely, and to leave the rio slight circumstances possess by urinoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was madness to work on the experience of iri dudaughler of the lady whose house ho Chi-\nThe flight was frequented. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to meet in society; he is therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon realized that an assignment had been signed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent woman, a long thought. Not wasting time, he entered the world. Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of glory to be aware of her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had an opportunity on such a speech; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, was content with laughing. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this moment must be declino accornpaning his Lordship in the remower of their visit project, he ordered his fervent to look for other apartments, and on the other hand of the lady, inform her of all that he knew, not only with regard to the hor girl, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not invoke a special of his plans having been thwarted by the interpasion of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey dirocized his steps towards Greece, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found his sons at the news. He then fixed his residence in the bosom of a Groek; and soon took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of the aricient glory on the local prominent monuments, scathed by the ohronic 1 of the deods of free men on the slaves before, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the roof of fame as herself, there existed a bein g, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of hayfvl into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke to Muchmind for anyone to think she could belong to those who had no souls. As she put on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for who could have exchanged his yeah, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the appropriate animal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ionthe often accompanied Auhrey in his sea after antjquites, and often the clumsy girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of her forrn, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on a nearly erased tablet, in the ointment of her figure of sylph. Ofton wanted his falling braids, as she flattered around the cliff in the ray of the sun so brilliantly shining and felt discoloring the shades, he simmered well the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escape his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital importance of the proper interpretation of the passage of cl in Pausanias. But why try to be charms that everything feels, but laughs can enjoy ?— It was innocent, young and brittle, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and amazement balls. As you drew, these bones remain that they wanted to keep a memorial for her future hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical flaws of her pencll, plotting the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe her the circular dance on the open plain, matched him in the flamboyant olores of youthful memory, the rnarriago poem that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made an impressionniori Greeklter on her mind, told her all the supernatural lales of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent helief of what she was telling, aroused Aubreys interest; and often as she had told him that the living vompyre, wbo had spent years in the midst of bjs friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, based on the life of a fomola prolonged existence during the following months, his blood would be ruri oold, while he had rushed to laugh at such an idle and horrible fatase; but Ianthe quoted him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among tbemselvos, af ter many of their close relatives and children had found bcen marked with the stamp of the appetite of the friend; and when she flooded him so incredulous, shc begged of hiin to believe it, for he had pointed out that these who had dared to seek their existence, and had always had proof, which forced them to confess and to break his heart. She stripped him of the traditional applause of these monsters, and the horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord Ruthucn; he, who, still hesitated to persuade her, that there could be no truth in his fears, although at the same time he erred in many sentences that had all tended to excite a in the supernative belief power of Lord Rulhveri.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianlhe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the emotional virtues of women among whom he had sought the vision of romance, gained his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hahits, biting a Greek girl without education, still found himself more and more attached to the almost magical form before hlm. He sometimes ripped it off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he could go away, dissuaded not to return until his object was reached; but he still found impossible six of his attitudes on the ruins surrounding him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Daniel was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate from him with reticence; but it was because she did not have to lorge a single with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, that her guardian was occupied in the drawing or uncoveringsame fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, the pale horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they shouted the name of the place, they all both begged not to come back at night, because he had to go through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the animals in their night orgies, and bare the most body ailments as impondering on the one who dared to cross the third path. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superjor, an infornal power, whose very name apparently frcezed his thorium blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey ended his excurfion; he was surprised to observe the molcholy face of his host, and felt puzzled to find that the words hjs, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, bad inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and sincerely begged HLM to crash, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the day limb would end saori, arid that on the horizon there was one of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He finally groaned, mounted bis borse, determined to move by speed for the delay hjs: but he was looo late. Twice, in these southern climates, the almost unknown; immodiately, the sun sets, the neighborhood begins: arid he had advanced far away, the power of the storm was engaged — his horny thunders hardly had a rest interval — his thick heavy groove forced his way near the cariopying falsification, while the forked blue light seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the eritangled forest. The animal finally, because of fatigue, stopped, and it found, by the glare of lightning, that it was iri, the district of a havel that hardly lifted upwards of the masses of dead leaves and bruine bruce surrounded it. Demonstrating, he learned, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to the East trusting to get a shelter from the bone pool, the storm. As he approached, the tbunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who was making a mockery, exulting, of a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was set on his way; but, awakened by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with an effort suddenly, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in the darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He found himself in a contact with an oria which he immediately grasped; when a voice shouted ,\" Always scorned !\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by an oria whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he strangled; bull. It was in vain: he had been lifted up from his way and cast with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy fell upon him, and kneeled upwards of his brecls, had placed his haries upon his throat — when the dazzling of many torches penetrating through the hole of thal given light in the day, the trouble ;— he rose up unfathomably, and, bis leclante prey, precipitated both the door, and in a moment the crashing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer the beard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was heard by those who heard it. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the straw charged on each straw with heavy flakes of soft. In search of Aubrey Tbey who had attracted him to his series, he was again in darkness; but who was her husband, when the light of the trachees burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful coriductress brought in a course of lifeless. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a big vision coming from his troubled imagination ;6 but he again saw the same foreign, when he dispossessed them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, even on his lip; that there was a dizziness about his caress that seemed almost as time as the baby life that once lived there :— on his rieckarid breast was blood, and on his throal were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the merited, weeping, simultaneauxly struck the spiritual horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her, who had recently raised the object from so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the engine of life that had died in it. He did not know what the thoughts of bis were – his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflection, the cold took refuge in the vacancy – he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had a boon found in the hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her, which another had infused. Their lamentations 61 were, as they approached the city, warning the parents of a disaster of the disaster. \"From scrojbe their mourning would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was drunk with the most violent felt, and was often delirious; in these intervals he would have called up to on the road. Ruthven clung to Ianthe – by imprescriptible somc corn that he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare being he loved. At the time, he cursed the curses on his head, and cursed the ham as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, lucky this time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, in cheering in the state of Turkey, immediately placed his sons in the same house, and became his constant assistant. When the latter recovered from his deljrium, he trembled and was surprised by the blow of the one whose image was now combined with the that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their solution, and even more by the attention, anxiety and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite ochanged; he appeared more than the apalhetic beirig who had so surprised Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence bogon to be rapid, ho gradually withdrew into the slclte sclme of the mind, and Aubroy did not perceive any differentene from the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on bim, with a smile of malicious exvulsion playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile hunned him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in watching the tideless waves raised by the coaling breeze, or by marking the progress of these orbs, circumspecting, like our world, the motionless sun ;— in fact, he seemed to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was weakened, and the thal elasticity of fpirit, which once had a distinguished hair now seemed slod forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as he wished for salvation, his misrid would not find him in the vicinity of Atbens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he used to frequent, the shape of Iarithc stood by – if he were looking for him in the world, his slight step was drawn wondering in the middle of the underground babe, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly turning, would show, to his wild imagination, his wounded throat face clnd pee, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each element of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthugri that he himself takes care of himself during his illness, in order to visit these regions of Greece and not yet go there. They walked in all directions, and looked for a place where a memory could be attached; but, although they had taken possession of it from one place to another, they did not seem to take account of the war they were watching. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended from claimed to be dangerous. Because of this neglect of local counsel, they occasionally traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. At the entrance...\nOn the other hand, a limited number of enterprises\nAt the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks brought down from the nearby precipices, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were started by the whistling of the clove bullets to their hoads, and by the echo of the relation of the evocative gains. In an instant, the guard body had left the lhem, and by placing the babind rocks of exercise, had begun to pull the same ratio towards the iri blue wheeled. Aubrey, Lord Ruthven, retired for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement; but shameful, thus held by an enemy, who shouted at them with hearing, and being exposed to unrelenting slaughter, is afraid of the robbers should climb over and take them to the rear, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey sat down to help him; and, no longer than there was danger, he was soon surprised by the fact that his guards began to scream at Lord Ruthvens wounds, tossed his arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them out of his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, which was no more dislocated by their possessor – they simply kept the entrance until the comrade their returned with the sum pramized, for what he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days the mortification followed, and death broke a path with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; it seemed that the pain was as unconscious as it had been of the objects surrounding him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with more seriousness than usual — Assist me! You can save me – you do more than that – I do not mean my life. I have listened to the teeth of my existence as thin as one of the passing days; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little, of my opacity of life, I cannot explain everything —6 but if you imagine everything you know about me, my horror was free to stain in my mouth — and if my death was unknown for some time in England — me — but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence :\"Swear by your soul, by all your fears, swear that, a year and a day, you do not import your knowledge of my crimes to any living being in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or what you can see. \"He saw his eyes burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he slept laughing on the pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew from the result, but did not stop; the many circumstances that were present at his arrogance with this man arose upon his spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill fell upon him, as if he were in the present of something terrible awaiting him. He got up early in the morning, and he took over the stirrup in which he had left the corpse, when a rober met him, enlisted. he was no longer there, having passed on by himself and his comrades, at the time when he withdrew, at the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, heading towards a prom, they had given his secretary, that he should be exposed 6 th to the first ray of the last moon rose after his death. Harry finished, and took several of the men, determined togo and buried him in the place where he was lying. But when the hc rose to the top, he found no of the troce or body or clathes, although the thieves swore that they had reported the identical rock or that they had laid the body. For some time, the basic spirit was relegated to conjugations, he finally came back, convinced that they had yelled at the body for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for heighten that melancholic superslitif who had grasped on his mind, to be resolved to leave him, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to go to Otranto or Naples, he took care of the organization of these effects which he had with him belonging to LordRuthven. Among the others, there was one case where there were several weapons of influence, more or less objected to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at sinning a stomach apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, on his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, although particularly shaped, the fheath he held in his harid. His eyes seemed to have no need for such certainty, they would be preparing to be bound to the dagger, but he still wanted to distract himself; but the particular shape, the same different shades upon the haft and the sheath were similar in splendor on both, and left no place to doubt; there were drops of blood alsa on each.\nHe left Smyrna and, on his return to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had tried to snatch the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she has not been heard since the departure of her lordship. The Aubrey spirit became almost broken under the repeated horrors of Mary; it was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Iarithe. He stood up and was silent; and his only ccupatiori pusist in exhorting the spied bones, the poftilions, as if he were going to save you the lily of whatever and he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which sown, obcdinated at his will, soon tucked him on the English shores; and he hastened to his father's house, and lerc, for a mummerite, appeared tolose, in the cavities and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was full inore attaches a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have total winning thanks to which wins the look and applause of drawing-room assemblies. There was none of this light shining that exaggerates only in the rough atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eyes never light up by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to arise from the malfortune, but from the sensation of the home inside, which appeared to indicate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not light footing, which goes astray where a butterfly or a colour can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, his face was brilliant by the smile of joy; but when his brother shone at his hls affection, and would be in his presence to forget those deuils that she knew destroyed his rest, who would have excavated his smile for this vocabulary or lhe? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still eighteen years old, and she had not been introduced to the world. She was taught by her guardians more in shape than her preconception should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, would be the opposite of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey prefers to stay in the home of his fathers, arid feeds on the melancholy that orders him. He could not feel interested in the friuolities of the fashjoriable strangers, when his mind had been so hot by the students he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to his sister's protectoriori. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared for him the next day, which was badly announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a bad living room did not hold long, and all those who were impatient with books in the kingly smile, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account everything around him, engaged iri that to remember that the time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place — he suddenly fessed himself by the arm, and a voice he rebuked too well, smiled at his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had a hard courage to turn, afraid to see a spectrum that blasthim, when he pierces, a little distance away, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs were almost refusing to carry the weight of the Ir, which was forced to take a friend's clum, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driving home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of the big brain. Lord Ruthven again preceded him — the circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He awakened himself, he could not believe it — the dead resurrection again! e :— He slipped his imagination and had swore over the magic his mind was rested on. It was impossible for him to be real — so he soaked up going back to society; although he tried to dare about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. By allowing his murder the protection of a matron, he withdrew to a corner, and there he went to his own devoring affairs. Perceiving that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by many, apparently in a bitter conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one, whom he had asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these excrements that he was most abhorrent. And he took his sister's arm, and hastily forced her to the street; and at the gate he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were striving for their lords; and while he was engaged to Jri, he passed them by, and heard the voice whispering at the top, saying ,\"Remember your oath !\"\nThe Aubrey became very distracted. If before the mind of this was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's living has again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was not listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her who had caused her abruper. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more unbeliever he was. His oath surprised him ;—was he then to lower this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon bis breath, almost all that he has defiled dearly, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been naked by him. But even if he broke his oath, arid discose a bis specialist, who would believe it? He bought his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he remembered, had already mocked beer. For days, he remained in the state of this; locked in his room, no one was seen, and no one ate until his sister came, only with eyes floating in tears, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Lost, unable to endure silence and loneliness, helest his house, wandered from the street to street-\nand, desiring to steal this image that flouted him. His dress bewitched, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humidity of the night. He was not ten years old to be recognized; he first returned home, and at last he laid him to rest where fatigue was weak. His sister, colleagues for his safety, employed people to follow a bim; but they were soon distanced by a bim who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought — from. However, his conduct has suddenly changed. Sluck with the idea that he left by the absence of all his friends, with a friend ainongst babe, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to look closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered the room, his hamburger and his distrustful looks were so stubborn, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was lagging behind in begging him to refrain from stalling, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the guardians thought it was good to intervene, and fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to take up this list that had previously been imposed on the in by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the injuries and from the sufferings that he had daily received in his wandorings, and to prevent him from expatriating to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take control of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, because he had completely absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence was finally so great that he was confined to his room. There, he would lie for the sadder days, unhappy to be awake. He had become macaceous, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and respiration appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he desired that she should not touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, come near to him !\" Where, however, she asked what to be referred, her only answer was ,\"True! True !\" He rang again in a slate, from which he was never able to wake him. It took a lot of months: however, little by little, as the year passed, its less frequent became inconsistencies, and his mind threw away some of his morosity, which was his guardian observed that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his tutors entering the room, began to converse with his doctor about the mental circumstances of being Aubrey in a situation. so awful one, when his fisher went the next day to get married. Instantly, everybody's attention was drawn; he anxiously asked them. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, of which they feared that which had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Avbrey Seemod pleased, and surprised them even more by his business intention of expressing his present at the nationals, and deciding love to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. Hc was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears of wet mind, slowing down to the thought of his brothel to be once more alivo than the tributaries of the affluent. Hc began to speak with all his won warmth, and to congratulate his marriage champion ber with a person his distinguished for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on the ber chest; the opening, what was his surprise as b holding the characteristics of the mo nster who had so long influenced life. He took the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and took it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grab his bandf, and look at her with a frantic expression of face, swearing that she would not want to marry this inonster, for he — but he could not advariate — it seemed that if that voice had again made him repeat his oath —he turned suddenly round, thinking Lord Ruthuen wcls a rare hlm bull did not see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard this whole, and bought that it was only a return to her disorder, center, and the forcing Mifs Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them. He became irritated, and he begged to wait one day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, had taken possession of his spirit, drenched to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthvon had nointed the morning after the dredging room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard Aubreys ill health, he readily realized that shells were the cause of this disease; but the one he learned was considered an insanity, his exultation and pleasure could be hard to correlate with those among whom he had slipped this information. He welcomed your house from his former companion, and, through constant attendance, and the pretension of affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist the power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could spoak of himself as an individual and not have sympathy with any guidance on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed if ;—could say how, as he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of prelection, if it were joyfully that to nright listen to his soothing occents ;—finally, know so well how the use of the serpents art, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the older branch fell to its length to, he obtained a large embassy, which announced itself as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed slate of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAvbrey, when left by the physician and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, the corijuring, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hope and hope of their dung, to delay but for a few hours the marriage last, on which to be denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that just bet so as not to harass Miss Aubrey, they any more, what he orisi dared, tobe ravings of a cassava. The night passed on without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house, which; arid Aubrey heard, with a horror that me more easily be enced than doscribod, the notes of the Hussy preparation. The morning came, and the wagon sound broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cu priority of the servants of Tbe eventually surpassed the violence, they gradually stole the grip, leaving it in the vice of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a bourid coming out of the room, and, in an inoment, he found himself in the opartment where the entrapment was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, waved, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, speechless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven bowed in his ear :\" Remember your death, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came ill into the sea from him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage did not find ventilation, a bad break of a blood-vessel, and he was transmitted to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the politician was afraid to shake him. This marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bride left London.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister guardians to be hasty, afraid when midnight had struck, to tell the corn that hit the order, he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; a bumblebee when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and the Aubrey sister had slipped AVAMPYRE's thirst!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The wasal world 1 before the third, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIn the Greek Archipelago, on one of Majcstys ships, iri in the year 812 we put in the port of Mit-\nYlene, on the island of this name. The beauty of this place, and a certain supply of arid vegetables of cattle still to there, lead many British ships to visit jt—warmen and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, it is Bountjesamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and that the men were carrying water, and that the bag for the cattle with tbc native, the ecclesiastical, and I took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound so named) we met and engaged young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English eurreney ,) and resided in the threshing about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the difference is the islands .\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose the lime in the haste at the time our peasant had recovered. We were kindly received by an old man who was running off over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious clot attached. They were simply called ecoré: light green walls, marble tabl ef on either side, myrtle of lorge in the center, and small suntain below, which could be made for play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Vonus in a hole of leclriing; a large sofa or fofa o0 fills the fur. In the hall, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and a bookcase vacuum: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom table had only one spread mattress, with two cotton mattresses and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books of cold papers, who were then in the chest of a great sailor in the boot: it was open, but we did not think that ourselves justified examining the content. On the reverse tablet, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimrnerman, in the Germari language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebuc; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Ilalian edition, printed in Parma in 10; several small pamphlels of the Greek press in Constantinople, very torn, but no English book of any description. Most these books were accompanied by marginal notes, written with a pericil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man exclaimed :\"The lord had read these boat-tune evening, so he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie to his room; for he is so porticular, that if I went to the thing with the orders of Oul, he would frown inside for a week; he is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; afraid I had the product of his farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I paid to an older Armenian who cruised in a small cottage in the wood, and which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the outdoor use was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty pieces long and fourteen wide, and the pillars in marble fluted with black and fri-\nThe comics (as is the case today in Greekman arochemistry) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof of Tbe, surmounted by a stone balustro of light, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surpassed, as on them, the Greeks pass their evenings by smoking, drinking wines of light, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and leaves gathered together on its borders, and under the shade of large bushes of myrtle, a seat of marhle with an outnameritaIwooden back was placed, on which we are told, the 1 rd passed many of his evenings and nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed because he was fervent devotees, and that he always kept our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a view of the bird\". A line of rich vineyards drew attention to Mount Calcla, covered olive and mature trees in bloom, and to the top of a tree whose ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, and a horizon overflowing with a single eloud, finishes the sight in front; and a little a left tip, through a vista of high carbon and palm trees, the febrile srall islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald greeri. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were fruitful on the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who went to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could he,\" but ,\"I sure he won\" and can you say it, an old friend?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but in our return to the city, we learned several from the secluded lord parliculars. He had porped eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even a daric with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he was often given Greek Testaments to poor children. In the school, he appeared to us, of all that we chose, as a very eccentric and benevolent character. An opportunity that we lick, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to decipher. He had a beautiful romantic daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and taught him himself the music of this one.\nSuch as the information with which we left MityIene's peaceful life; our imagination all about the rock, guessing who this crawling into Greeco could be. He found money that he was used: to be a bad philanthropy of disposion, and all these eccentricities which inark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pupil of WYATTLES, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tcnedos, and I also visited him in Mltylene\". We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been so many years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put only our hands to recognize the recluse of C local iri every page. We deeply regretted that we had not been curious about our research at the college, but we comforted the overs Ives with the idol to return to Milyle some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I take this statement, believing that he laughs without any interest, and in court in the good name of his seigneuria, who has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The focus is directly inverse, as can be clearly obtained from these anecdotes of little. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have the most seat in his room. The tenderness, sympathy and charity appear all his actions; and his awakening to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being on whose heart, religion has put his sole, and over whose head, Beneuolence has a broken maritle. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral lawlessness of a man; and the one who dares to justify it realizes that the horrible court where I have to appear, only can censor the errors of a sellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Making progress in dryness, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END!\nGjllet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "15": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy Johri William Polidori.\nTHE superstition on which this tale is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend, hawen, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it did not assume its sorm present since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea is becoming dominant, that a Latin body could riot correct if you tried on their territory, it gradually increased, and sow subject to many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dcad rising from the tombs of toir, and sow on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, which led to the existence of the belief that the vampyres were soaking up some of the food of their victims, that the wbo was beautifying itself, losing their strength and dying suddenly of consumption; while these human boars were fattening — and that their veins were becoming distended to cause a state of replication, to cause the burden of all passages of their body to sink, and even to curl the pores of their skiris.\nIn London Journal, March 13 th, is a curious, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which would have occurred in Madreyga, Hung-\nYes. It seems, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the Place de Tbe, that they unanimously affrmed, that, about five years earlier, a criminal Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the srontiers of the Servia Turkisb, had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to ridicule himself of evil, eating part of the land of the tomb of Lhe Vompyre, and rubbing himself with his blood. However, this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being burned by him, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants who consulted Ir Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrlsm) fresh, and entirely free of corrupt Jon, and emitting inuth, rice, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where it is reported that you shouted so terribly as if he had been alive. This did, cut his head, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grove. The same measures were adopted with the course of these people who had died of vampyrism before, unless they were, in turn, some agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his tum.\nChief Hail.\nThis rodomonlade monfrouf is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other forum that might be presented. In many parts of Greece, just is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed waste in existence, that the deceased is not a blindly vampyrise door, but forced to limit his infernal visltations only to those whom he loved lost while at the top of the earth — those to whom were bound by ties of kinship and affection. — An absolute supposition to the \"Giaour\".\nBut the fir trees of the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy horn is torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of the natius, Arid sucks the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of life; and eats the banquet that shall feed thy living living, Tby victims, are still exhaled. They will beat the devil for their sire; As thou mockest thee, thou shalt irrit them, Thy flowers will fall upon the stem. But it is for your crime that he falls, the youngest, the best beloved of all, shall bless you with the name of father — Thot word shall wrap your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last cloth of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see Who freezes or his lifeless blue; Thon with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the thorn is the most heaviest worn — But now has been born away from your Memoricll of your agony! But with the tbine itself, blood shall flow; thy grinting tooth, and the lip of sack; then hunting at the sullen falls, Go — and with the Govls and the Afrits rave, until hese in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the blue essence of her life, she enjing has poured out throughout history as a type of competition of purity and innocerioe. The true Tourriefort gives an account in its lives of several amazing cases of clrnpyrism, to whom it is claimed to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forward the some savantod disserttotlons, tending to prove just to 6 th a classic, bone as well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting nolies about its singularly horrible superstition could be added; the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuolcd to the explanation, and which can now be concluded hy inerly remark, that though the term Vampyre is that in most general meanings, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in uarjovs parts of the world of lbe: Cls Vroucolocha, Vardaulachcl, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, various parts of the bones appeared the leaders bone the ton a nohleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the luxurious laughter of the liver only attracts his attention, so that he can by a look well, arid throw the fear into those breasts where the unbelievers reigned. Those who felt this frenzy of fear could not explain from where it lay: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixed on the face of the object, did not seem to peder, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the artery; but fell on the oheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities prevented him from being invited to all houses; I wanted to see the hive, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were bent to have something in their presence capable of attracting their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, the shape and the ovtline were beautiful simul, many female hunters after the notoriety tried to win her attentiontioris, and to win, at least, some mocks of what they call affection: Lady Mereer, who has been the trick of every monster in the drawing rooms since her marriage, thrown herfelf into her way, and did everything but pul or rest of a montebonk, to attract the attention of the people :— in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on the ber, still it seemed that they were not understood ;— even her incomprehensible impudence was strehensive, and she let go. But although the common adulter could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent spirit of a calion that was spoken to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, still unknown that he attached himself to the women. However, he had the reputation of a long victory; and if it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the voice, who was like howteri among the those women who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic virtues, bones among those who usually sully by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphan left with a sister of only in possession of a great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to him also by the guards, who dictated him simply to take care of the lake of his fortune, while they abandoned the greater burden of the basic spirit to the attention of the subaltem mercenaries, which cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. So he had this romantic feeling of arid honor, which every day ruines so many apprentices of thousands. He believed in sympathy for virtue, and thought that the uico was thrown into Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see it in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply corisist in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irritating folds and various colorful patches. He thought, in the end, that dreams were the realities of life. Hc was haridsorne, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, at his entrance into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth their languishing or farfelu favorite: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, arid by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon brought him to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the rannance of his hours of solilar, it began to find that, except in the tallow and the cracked wax candles, not fred the presence of a ghast, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of these plea congreries --\nThe cinematographic descriptions contained these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. On the other hand, because of some compensation in many gratified bis, he was six to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we had over the crowded, crossed him in his care.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an ideal of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, wbo gavo a few other sigrits of his external observatiori objects, that tacjt accord to their existence, implicit by evitaric tbe of their contact: allowing his irogination to pick up every thal thing flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as hero of a novel, and distracted from observing the offspriving of bis sancy, rather than the person before him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He learned gracefully that Lord Ruthveri's business was embarrassed, and soon he realized that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this character finally, who, until now, had only captured his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was late for him to execute the day, which, for many genres, was deemed necessary for young people to take a few quick steps on the edge of the vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the elderly, arid not to appear them as fallen from the skics, whenever intrigues scandalous are mentioned as subjects of pleclanterie or practice, in accordance with the degree of competence shown in carrying this sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his internions to Lard Ruthven, was surprised to make a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a brand of esolem by HLM, which apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he gladly accelerated it, arid in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHthorto, Aubrey had had the opportunity to study Lord Rulhvens character, and now he found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to this view, the results offered different conclusions of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundantly rich, liberally ;— idleness, vagaboride, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes which accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted alarms of bis ;— they sent out the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when he profligated Carno to ask for something, not to relieve his sighs, but to immerse him in his lust, or to sink him even more into his iniquity, he sent him with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which usually prevails over the hedge at the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those on the way it was granted, unshakeably found that there was a curse on her, because they were encumbered either led to scaffolded them, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in the cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the fadoriary vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always bet with success, except where the best known was this antagonjst, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the healthy unohanging face, with which he generally looked at the arourid society: it was not, however, when he would encumber the young novice eruption, or the unlucky father of a riumous family; then his wife seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction of the strewn mind, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the catwhilst delirting with the half-deceived mouse. In every city, he left the once rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat frantically, in the midst of the loo ks speaking of mute bungry children, in the mind only one distant from his last immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the tabla gamhling; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the lheconvulsive take of the innocent: this could but be the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, commented, capable of fighting the trick of themselves experienced. Aurey has often fought to represent this to a friend's bis, and begged him to resign from this charity and plea which proved the ruin of the stumbling block, and did not stand in the way. — but he dislodged him — it is hoped that his friend will give him a little opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this rumour has occurred. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of various wild scenes and rich bones, was always the same: his eye spoke of the levees that his lip was; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he dared not omit any great nor gratification of him but the tough excitement that vainly wanted to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the training of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his appearance; he left him in the daily joy in the morning circle of an Italian country, who married in search of the anniversaries of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he exhaled with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had before buried in his imagination that there was a power of evil residing in his companion, they seemed to give him some reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he immediately left his friend bis, rushed to say that his character was terribly viclaus, because the possession of an irresistible power of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulterous which had not been born of hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the partner of his vilt, should be precipitated from the pinacle bone unsold virtue, to the lowest abyss of the infamy and degradation: in flne, he had all the semalefs he had sought, apparently because of their virtuo, hod, since his departure, cast aside the mask, and had no scruples to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey was detorting at the time of the departure of the eye, the one who had a character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, purposing, in the cell then, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass any slight circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that if Lordship was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly frequented at home. In Italy, it is Seldoin that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was obliged to keep his place secret; but Aubroy's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that a donkey had been named beeri, which would probably end in the ruiri of an innocent, gypsy girl. Losing from time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked her his intentions with respite to the lady, informing her at some point that he was aware of his being on the point of the sweet one that night. Lord Ruthven clung to the fact that his interests were such as he thought he would have had on such an occasion; and after having been in a hurry if he intended to marry him, laughs inerly. Aubrey was rejoining himself; and, no doubt, he pointed out that from that moment on he refused to accompany his Lordship in reclinder him of their extended visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and sticking to the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. This assignment was over. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to notify the Bill of full consent to a separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been defiled by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey went to Greece, and struck the peninsula, soon in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and quickly took care to trace the faded documents of ancient monuments' glory upon who, apparently, ashamed to chronicle the acts of free slaves or to assimilate the slaves, had said themselves under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as hiinself, there existed a beautiful and delicate being, because that should inigbt formed the model for a painter wishing to fortray or canvases the hope promised of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too mirid so that someone might think that it might belong to those who did not evil. As she stood on the plateau, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for those who could have excavated her eye, apparently to the eye of an angry nature, for this luxurious and stunned look of the animal committed suicide but had the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butler of Kashrnere, shaw all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, with the greedy look of hjm, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the conclusion of his figurative shape. Often, her braids would fall, as she freaked out around, would display in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, this might well excuse the oblivion of the ontiquary, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had besieged of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms with all the feelings, but no one can appreciate it ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by the drawing rooms and the stinging balls. As he drew these remains which he poured out to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical erasings of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; sbe would then describe her dance circling on open tbe plain, would paint, to him in all the brilliant colors of the young mother, the pomp of marriage that she queenrnbered watching in her childhood; and tben, to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression upwards in her mind, would tell her all the supernatural tales of her laugh. Her sincerity and her apparent belief of what she was telling, extorted the iriterest even to Aubrey; and she often told bim the story of the living vampy, who had passed through yesors in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced every year, by slitting on the life of a lovely fernale to prolong his existence for the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to get her out of such idle and horrible fclntases; but Ianthe quoted him the names of the old men, who had finally detected a living among the thomselves, after several of their close relatives and their children had been found dragged with the seal of the friends appetia; and when she found the back so incredulous, she begged him to sit down, so he had been noticed, those who had dared to question their existence, had always had the proof, and bound to confess to him, to confess. She detailed him the traditional craze of these monsters, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lard Rutbven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there would not be the truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the coinocences Mary who had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to Iantho; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virtues of the women that he had sought to see love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, still to find sons more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form before her. At times he was tearing himself apart from her, and, forming a plan for a few antique dealers, he went away, decided not to return to the object reached; but he always had the impassable to focus his attention on the tricks around him, while in his mind he took up an image which seemed to be the sole owner of his thoughts. Theanthe was unconscious of his love, and also always the same child frank being that he had first knawri. She has always seen your share of him reluctantly; but it was because she had no one left that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragment that had still escaped the time-destructive band. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and both, with several present, affirmed existence, called with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to take one of his excursions, which prevented him from holding him for a few hours; they heard the name of the pl aee, all at once begged not to come back at night, because he had to go through a world, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day had closed, until any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of companies in their nocturnal origins, and denounced the heaviest evil as imminent on the hlm who dared too much their palh. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them out of the ideal; but when he warmed them up to his audacity to mock a superior in this way,\nevil power, the very name of which, by chance, shaped their blood gel, it was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excrement; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was dismayed to find his words, mocking the belief of these horrible proud ones, inspired them with such a terror. When he was enlisted to leave, Iarithe came to the side of his horse, and he became seriously angry with him, and at night left the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. It was, how very, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that day-light was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spocks whieh, iri tho warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring all their rage over the devoted land .— He at least, however, mururized his horse, determined to catch up with your speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in these climates of the south, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was the above — his echo through the ndors had barely a resting interval — The heavy rain forced his way through the oanopying foliage, while the light forked blue seen to fall and relative to his very feeling. Suddenly, his hare was frightened, and he was carrioled with terrible clpidity in the tangled forest. Finally, the animal stopped, through fatigue, and found, by the glare of a thal, that it was in the vicinity of a novel which hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little orient to guide a bim to the city, at least confident to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a smiling woman with the suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost non-brokeri sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, by a sudden effort, forced the door of the hul. He found himself bimbo in the whole darkness: sound, however, guided him. He was not apparently...\nBecause he called him, he continued the sounds, and he didn't notice him. He sneaked into contact with someone he seized immediately; when a voice exclaimed ,\"Agclin ba waffled!\" He felt in vain raised from his feet and threw huge blows of whips against the ground: his enemy threw himself at him, and knelt his chest, he threw himself on his throat; when the brightness of the torches of penelrat mary crossed the hole of daylight, he disturbed him; he rose instantly, and let his prey rush through the door, and in an instant the jamming of the branches, as it was broken in the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was no longer there; and Aubrey, who was not able to move, was soon heard by those who had none. They entered; the light of their torches fell over the mud walls, arid the thatched loaded on each straw with heavy soft flakes. To the Dossier of Aubrey, they feared for the one who had drawn him up with his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the high of the torches once again burst upan hiin, to perceive the airy farm if his beautiful conductor brought a course without life. Ho closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from his disturbed imagination; but he saw the shape again, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but he was a silence on his face that seemed to be almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and upper herthroat were the marks of the having opened the uine :— to this men pointed, wept, at the same time, were filled with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A Character !\" A staff was formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of the lift which had died in her. He knew what the hif thoughts were: his mind was benumbed and seemed to have a reflection, and take refuge in the vacation—ho held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular buildingjon, which had been found in the hul. They were defiled by different parties that had been erected in search of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, approaching the city, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of Boir would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of the death of their umbrella, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the worse. They are inconsolable; both died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and well often delirious; in these intervals he called upon Lord Ruthven and upon Ionthe – by an irreproachable combination, he seemed to be begging his former corn panion to spare the being he loved. At the other time, he cursed his head and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from the weather pattern, on the healing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and took his constant attendant. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and set out to see him, of whom he had now combined marriage with the got af at Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, repented almost all of the fault that had caused separation, and lingered more by the attention, anxiety and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite changed; it no longer seemed that the apathy of being what had so stunned Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, except sometimes that he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, with a smile of malicious extullation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this glaring haunted him. During the first stage of the recovery of the Inualid, Lord Ruthven was apparently ingested in looking at the waves of tidalles raised by the cooling breeze, or in marking the progress of the thoso orbs, turning, like our world, the sun of the sheep ;— in fact, he seemed to have with to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey ind, by this shock, was well weakened, and this bad spiral elasticity once so distinguished it now seemed to run away forever. He was now a love of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired, his mind could not find Jt in the district of Atheris; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Ianlhe stood by his side — if he would lock him in the woods, his step would spell the garland in the middle of the undergrowth, in the void of the modest violet; then suddenly turnniring rovnd, would show, for hif wild imagination, his palc face and overflowed throat, with a sweet smile upon his lips. He determined to steal scenes, all of which created so bitter assocations in his mind. He advocated to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during the illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in the directian hurry, and looked for all the places to remember a memory that could be attached; but tangb so they connected from place to place, but they seemed to ignore what they looked up. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the geriaciousness of those whom they dissuade from so-called darigers. As a result of negotiating, so the council of the inhabitants, on a occasion they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than defense. When they entered the bed of a torrent, with large inasses of bravghl rock down from neighboring practices, they had a reason to repent of their neglect; the whole party was ferscarcely engulfed in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistling of bullets near their head, and by the echood ratio of several guris. In an instant, their guards left them, and, standing behind the rocks, started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind him by sheltering the television of defilement: but chalked to be thus held by a force, who, with insulting cries, shouted at them a dvarice, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers had to climb up and take them from the rear, they dwelt both to rush in search of the enemy. They barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven shot again in the shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no loriger taking into account the vessel or his own peril, is soon surprised by seeing the faoes of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Heaven wound, immediately thrown their arms and submerged.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded sling to a nearby hut; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were content to keep the entrance until his comrade returned with the promised sum, because he had an order. Lord Ruthens strength was rapidly diminished; in two days death followed, and death broke down in low steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious as it had been of the objects absout; but towards the end of the last evangelizing, the mind seemed to become uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was irritated to offer a big aid with more than usual serious —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I listened to the death of my existence as I say the death of the day of Passiring; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"\" How? What do you mean? I need a few hours, my life, a little space, I can explain myself, but if you want to hit me with everything you know about me, my man got rid of the defilement of the cap, and if my death had long been known in the Engolon, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself, seeing himself guilty of violence :\"Under by your soul resents, by all your nature fear, swears that, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to all being living in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :' I swear !' said Aubrey; he ran out laughing on his saliva, the arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey retired to rest, but didn't sleep; many circumstances atone his acquaintance with this man rose up on his mind, and he didn't know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if he was spoiling the present of something horrible bypass. He was about to enter the hovel iri which he had left in his body, a thief having met him, informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been driven by himself and his comrades, until he retired, to seize an inurit neighboring, according to a promise that they had given his seigneury bad, that he should be exposed to the coldest ray of the moon, pink trot after death bis. Aubrey stunned, and took men of the female, d and cried, to bury him in the place where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the body or clothes, though the thieves swore that they indicated the identical rock on which they had placed the body. For a time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally rained, convinced that they had pierced the carp for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible mistakes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstimulating melancholy which had dried on his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto, or your Naples, is busy ripping off the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Steven. Among the other cases, there was a case containing several weapons of offer, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. When he turned them around, and looked at the curious forms of Tiger, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dogger being discovered in the inevitable. but — he trembled — rushing to get the stealthy proof, he sounded the blue weapon, set on his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was equivalent, in particular fashioned, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eye no longer seemed to be certain: they saw that he bound himself to the dagger; but still which did not want to believe; given the particular shape, the same different shades on the shaft and sheath were similar in the splendor in the bath, set on no room left any doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left S. Myrna, and on his way home to Rome, his first business concerned the lady he had....\nHe took over the Lord Ruthvens seductive goldsmith. His parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and they had not seen the beard of the departure of his lordship since the departure. Aubrey's spirit is almost broken under so many repeated executioners; he was afraid that this lady might have been the victim of the native destroyer. He died morose and silerit; and his only occupation conjested in the exhortation of the speed of the postilions, as if both were to save the life of the home which he bequeathed dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to the will, soan stunned bim to the English sbores; and he hastened to the abode of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to the loss, in the embraes and caresses of his sister, all the inemorial of the past. If before, by her infannel caressing, she had slipped her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached to glues a companion.\nMiss Aubrey evil not to win the grace that wins the circle and applause from the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eyes never light up by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from a malaise, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a bad consciousness of a more screaming kingdom. His step was not that light footing, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was federated and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her armbuff breathed from her afsection bis, and would forget in her presence, those sorrows that she knew to destroy the bis rest, who would have exchanged her smile for this voluptuous? It seemed that those eyes—it was then playing in the light to their own nalive sphere. She was only 18 years old, arid had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought his guards would be more capable that his presentation would be delayed until his brother returned from the continent, where he could be his protector. So today was the next show, which was approaching quickly, could be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the manner of her father, and fed on the melancholy that carried the hive. He doesn't feel interested in the frivolities of fashion-\nWhen his reindeer had been torn apart by the events he had seen, he decided to sacrifice his own spouse for the protection of his sister's boss. And they came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a neat salon had been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to bask in the smile of the kingship, rushed to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stopped in a corner by herself, without taking into account everything around him, entered into the remorse that the first time he saw Lord Ruthuen was even this place — suddenly felt sawn by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, smiled in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had the arduous courage to turn around, fearing seeing a bit of spectre blazed him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the figure that he had drawn his attention to this place on his first erryinto society. He looked until the members of this aumost refusing for their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forced a passage into the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts were sixfold from his brain. Lord Ruthven again in front of him – circumstancos began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his oath. — He woke up himself he could not believe it – death rises again !— He touched his imagination, had brought up the irration on which his mind rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to return to society; for if he tried to ask the concerning Lord Ruthven, the narne clinged to the lips, and he would not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights after having with his sister at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself his devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that many were on the run, he used it, and when entering the room of another, found his surrouridod sisler by many, apparently in serious conuersaliori; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him some those traits that he was most abhorrent. He took his sister's arm, and, with a rushing march, abandoned him to the stratum; and at the door he found himself enjoined by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was engulfing them, he heard again that the voice murmured clinging to Hiin :\"Remove your oats !\"He dared not even, but, impatient with his sister, soon reached the horn.\nThe Aubrey became very distracted. If his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was rigored, now also the certitude of the living monster has pressed again upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now irritated, and it was in vain that she invited him to explain what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath was starred ;— was he then to allow this slinger to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, against all that he held; and not to avoid his progress? He could have touched his sister. But even if he was breaking his oath, and revealing his supplications, who would believe it? He thought of using the own hand of his to free the fram world such a wretched; but death, he remembered, had been derisively mocked. For days, he remained in this slate; stopping in his room, he saw no one, clinging to eat only when his sister came, wbo, with tears, begged him, for his good, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry skills and loneliness, he left his house, wandering your street, anxious to steal this haunted image. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the humidity of the midday. He was no longer to be assessed; he returned first with the evening dung; but finally he laid it down to rest, the tiredness of the bush surprised him. His sister, a referee for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon defamed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any, from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence, he left all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter again into sawhood, and looked at him closely, anxious to foresee, in spite of his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intlacy. But when one entered a room, his discontented and rogue gazes were so striking, but inwardly trembling so impossible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for his sake, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to be irritated and, fearing that his mind would get bogged down, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to drink from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered daily in his warriors, afraid to prevent them from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take Consul care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His ricoherence became so great, he could have found himself in his room. That was where he was lying for days, an airplane to be awakened. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affeotation and recolleotation that remained appeared on the entrance of his fister; then he was about to start something, and, grasping his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if your love for me is August, don't come near him !\" However, when she asked whom he was speaking to her answer was :\"Truly! Trvo !\" And again, he sank in a state, not even though she could wake him up. It lasted a lot of manthes: graduatedly. However, the class the year was past, its inconsistencies became less fruitful, and his mind lb broke part of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the mscly he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smiled.\nThe shooting had almost ended, when, on the day of the year, one of his guardians cracking his room, began to converse with his physician on the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, that his sister went the next day to get married. Instantly, Aubrey attention was attacked; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy is this mark of the return of the intellect, whose they feared that he had been deprived, they found the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished even more by his expression of his judgment. He is present at the riuptials, and he wants to see his sister. They didn't wake up, but in a few minutes if his sister was with him. He was apparently again the capablo of affected by the influence of his sweet smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kifed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for her rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which surprised him to see the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and put it on foot. On her asking Bim why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his scammer, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and looking at it with a sarritic expression of face, he told him to swear that she would marry this monster, for he — but he could advance riots — it seemed that this voice asked him to remember the oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was just a messy, cunning return, and away from Miss Aubrey, unleashed her to leave him. He sells them on his knees, he pleads, he pleads to delay the cabin for a day. They attached it to the soundlessness they imagined had taken the position of his mind, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with the hurry another. When he was aware of Aubreys ill health, he used it willingly to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was devoured of irisane, his culture and pleasure could hardly be corricialod of those among whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to the house of his companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretension of a great effect on the brother and interest in his destiny, he grafted Mifs Avreys ear. Who could resist his power? His duty of morality had dangers on the toils which he addressed to him—could speak of himself as an individual who had no fympathy to the spirit of any being on the crowded earth, attached himself to her to whom he addressed ;— could till how, since she was known, her existence had begun to appear worthy of preservation, if he was unwaveringly able to enumerate his bleeding accesses ;— in the end, he knew whether to use Ferpents art, or such was the case of destiny, that he earned his affection. The bedline of the eldest branch long sallingat to him, it was held on the important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage ,( n despite the disturbed status of his brother ,) which was to take place on the day very before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister bis, encircling him, as she valued her own happiness, bent his honor, and the good of those who are now in the tomb, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, for days, but for hours fcw this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest cursos. The sergeant promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he preferred not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what is considered, greasing a maniac. Neighl passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that razes more brittlely than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the noise of broken circles loudened his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiosity, if the servants of the last time overcame their vigil, they gradually went away, leaving him in the custody of an old defenseless woman. He realized the opportunity, with a single woman tied out of the room, and in a profound himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: who came immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed away from the room, the worldless with fury. When Lord Ruthven took the stairs murmured in his ar :\"Remember your oath, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. The women are fresh !\" Then, crying, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came badly in search of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury found no vent, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to her sister, who was rioting before she was born, as the doctor was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was solemnized, and the brink and groom left London.\nAbbreys weaknesses are increasing; blood efficiency produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated — he said immediately afterwards.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and the Austrian sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING A ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The sorcerer was in front of him, where to choose his resting room, and prove his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard a ship of His Majesty, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of Tbe the hot name. The beauty of this plateau, and the certain supply of catella and vegetables that must always be found, lead many British ships to visit it — men of war and mercharitmen; and although it is rather off the blue road for ships bourid in Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the puresor bargaining for the cattle with the nations, the clergy. and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places, where we had been a teacher. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, what am I probably? Get married. He was a curious, but a very good one. The house on the hill, facing the river, is long long, and he left the old man in charge of it: he gavo Dominick, the wire merchant, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there at fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his festival very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis story excited about our curiosity a lot, and we lost time in listening at home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who led us to the mansiori. It is composed of apartments located on the ground floor, an energizing room, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated with simplicity: light green walls, marble tables on the cilber side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small beneoth fountain, which could be fashioned to play around the branches by moving a six-point source in the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a sofa or a large sofa completed the furniture. In the half half stood a do 2 in English cane cbairs, and an empty library: there are no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor of Tbe, with stuffed cotton duvets and a plough, the basic common to Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were there in the large secret chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think that the novels justified by examining the content. On the tablet of the recreation play Voltajres, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau complete works; the ruins of the empires of Volncy; Zimmerman, in the language of Gerrnan; the Messiah of Klopstock; the riovels of Kotzebue; the play of Sehiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets snoring the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched every over, arid in darkness with a pile of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said :\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed.\ned, clnd forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie down constantly bjs come back; for it is so p ortlculor, that if I move a thing with orders of love, it would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a service; and I have the product of the farm of this for the difficulty of taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I pay to an older Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason why .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen broods, and the marble plover fluted with plinths of blocks and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considered higher than the roof. The roof, flooded with a light stone balustrado, was covered with a carpet of fir turkey, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the plants are furnished, for them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryina chrisli\", eating fruit, arid while enjoying the evening breeze.\nTo the left, when we enter the house, a little...\nEamlet glidcd far away, grapes, orariges and lime gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bufhes myrtle, a white marble seat an ornamental wood back was placed, on what we were told, the first passed many of its evenings clnd nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and taking to leisure. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attracted our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThis seen from this seat was what can be 6th tormed \"cl birds-view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle in flowers, and on the top bones that an ancient Greek temple seemed to be a majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descends into broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the mountain baso. The smooth sea like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were clearly obsessed, studying the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed the sight more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as the name of the person who had resided in romantic solitude this: no one knew his name but Dominick, a banker bis, who had gone to Canada. \"Armenian\" said our chief ,\"could call 1, but I sure he doesn't want to ,\",\" And can you say, old friend ?\" \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several characteristics of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls. He was the last one on the island, and he even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testarnerits to a poor green child. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we had gathered, to have was a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend called the cocottago thought the producer did not discriminate. He had a more beautiful godfather, with whom the nobleman was often seen walking on the sea-shoro, and he had bought him a piano-store, and he himself taunted the use of it.\nThis was the agriculture with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imaginatives all on the rack, guessing what this rambler in Greece could do. He had money, it was obvious: he hod the philanthropy of disposition, arid all these economics that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermoo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a pulpi 1 of WYATTLES, who had been relegated in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, about whom you are so aridious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never had the renown of his secretary, as we had been some of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calclas account on every page. Deeply done with regretting not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will be laughed back. I understood that this riot was not intolerant, and in court for the good name of his worship, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to human nature, or contribbling in any way, its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrays the Lordship poems, seems to make their place in the bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of loneliness is a strange reason to mark him as a believing upon whose heart, Religian, hot put his challenge, and upon whose head Benevolence cast the mantle. No clean has read the pleasant \"trails\" procedure without feeling proud of a peasant. As far as his dreams or pleasures are concerned, I do not attend a right to give you an opinion. Relationships must always be received with a calculation, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a living-death. Lord Byron's character is a genius of his boss. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous conscience and solf-approval.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleel-Streel.",
    "16": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy Jonathan Polidorj.\nThe superstition on which this tale is falsified is very general to the East. It did not extend to the Greeks until they swelled the establishment of Christjanity; arid took its present form only from the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which the lime, the idea spread, that the Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually grew, and formed the subject of many stories of wonder, still existing, of the dead who rose from the tombs of Jr ., and celebrated themselves on the blaod of the young Beautjsul. In the Wost, it spread, with a few slight variations, everywhere in Hurigary, Poland, Australia, and Lorraine, where the helief exists, that vampyres nightly soaked up a certain portion of the blood of their victims, wbo became einacized, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while these 6 suckers of the human moon diminished — and their velns became distracted such a state of repletion, as to cleave the blood to flow from all the passages of their bodics, and even pores even from their skins.\nIn London, January, March 1732, is a curca, and, of course, a credible story of a particular case of vampyri-\nsm, which is declared to have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. She oppées, thal upori ari examination of the emmander-in-chief and the magistrals of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named A Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cofsovie, on the friars of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, bul had found a wclyto to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth through over the fat of the smallpox, arid rubbing himself with his blood. This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by the ham, and a statement was made that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. The inhabitants, after consulting Iheir Hadagni, seized the body, and found (as is usually believed in vampyrism) fresh, completely free of corruption, and emitting pure and florid blood to the mouth, nose and ears. Evidence was obtained, they resorted to the habituation medicine. A stake was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had abated Aliue. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of those who had died before of vampyrism, for fear that the thybould, in turn, would become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire herself, and sucks iri its moon.\nChief Bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems preferable to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only made for vampyris, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to beings he loved most while he was on the ridge — those to whom he was bound by bonds of friendship and affection .— A supposition alludes to the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, on the earth, as Vampyre sent him, let your Corsica be torn from his tomb; then, haunting the place of origin, and sucking the blood of all your seed; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drains the bottom of life; yet hate the banquet that is to feed your Corsican living, Your victims, are yet come to pass, They will smit the devil to their sire; as you cursed them, Your flowers are bluffed on your foot. But your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father: This word will engulf your heart in flames! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last mooring of his cheek, the last spot of the eye, and the last glassy look must see which freezes his blue face; then, with the hand without defilement will tear the braids of his yellow hair, Df who, in life of locks when the thorn Affeoton the tenderest pledge carried — But now is a boom away from your Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning tooth, and your harry lip, and then trampling on your sulten tomb, come on, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, till this in horror departs from the cursed spectre than they do.\nMr. Sauthey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyorse of the Indian Arab Oneiza, what if represented cls being turned frowning the grave away the purpose of tormenting it she loved betterwhilst in exile. But this cannot be supposed to have led to the sin of her life, it has been reversed throughout history as a complete type of pure city and innocence. Tbe veracious Tournefart giues has long counted his journeys and several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have beer on eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a goriety of anecdotes, and lradiary narratives illustrating his effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to praver him to be a classic error, as well as harbaricln.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that though the term Varnpyre is the once in the most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocca, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the middle of the dissipations over a London winter, the different parties of the leaders of the town appeared to a problemman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the laughter of the fair attracted only his attention, which he scrambled with a glance, stifling him, and which he feared in the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this frenzy of fear, could not explain from where it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem penetrated, and suddenly topierco through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of the lead that wigbed on the skin he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to each house; all desired to see him, and those who had been accused of violating the excitement, and now felt the weight of the ennuj, carried happy to gain something in their presence capable of engajing their tension. In the spit of the dead shade of bis, which never galeneda tinted warmer, either of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, there were many women who, after trying to gain his attention, and winning, at least, some marks of what they might term afferiori: Lady Mercer, who had been mocking monster of evory in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did anything but pulsate on the robe of a movement, to increase her notoriety :— in vain :— who stood before him, although the eyes bis were apparently fixed on her, it seemed nevertheless that they were unperceived ;— before her impudence inappalized walls baffled, and she left the field. But although the common adult is not infuenco even the guidanoc of his eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to him: yet it is the apparent prudence with which one speaks to the virtuous wife and to lnocent daughter, that few know that he never addresses women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning torigue; and although it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, both was often close among female lhoses that make up the boasting of their sox of their domestic virtues, as among those who venture him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, Lerc came to London, a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in the child. Left to himself by the guards, who thought that they had only to take care of his forlune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the burden of subalternants, mercenaries, he cultivated more imagination than his judginent. That is why he took care of this high romantic price of good and candour, which destroys so many miller apprentices every day. He lent all to sympathizing virtue, and bought the vice wall was incrusted by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the stone, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage was simply in the bouquet of clothes, which were also warm, but what was better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and colorful vorious patohes. He thought, in the firie, to beat the dreams of the poets, the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, on his entering irito, goy circles, many mothers surrounded him, attacking that jcb should defcribe with the truth lasl lheir languishing or farfelu favovrit: the girls at the same time, by sheir lightening the faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eye, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his talents gripped his merit. Attached to the love of his lonely hours, he marveled at the brilliance, that, except in the candles of tollow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of fnuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant respect and descriptions calined in these volumes, from which he had formed the high study. However, finding a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to rolinquise his brains, when the extraordinary being that we had over the crowded, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it; on the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave loose signs of the observation of the oxternal objects, that the tac whom he consented to the existence of their, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon made this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his fantasy, rather than the person before hiin. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced his opinion that his presence was recognized as always. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon he found the notes of preparation to be frowned upon.\nThen iri — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of getting some information about this singular character, who, until now, could only hit his curjusity, he suggested to his tutors, it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has seemed necessary to me to enablo theyoung toke a few rapid steps in the caror of the vice towards being pvting on equality with the elderly, and riol also owing to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous entries are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or prlicise, aocording to le degrec de schillle shewen by wearing them. They reconciled; and Avbrey immediately speaking of his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join Bim. Flattercd by such a mark of esteem of harm, which, apparently, does not hold anything to a champion with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthveri's character, and now he found that, although the inarie hif actions were more exposed to the basic view, the results offered caricluses differing from the apparent motives of his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality ;— the ldle, the vclgabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than in enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuouf, reduced to indlgen ce by the misfortunes which accompanied him on virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— the door was sent out where sneezes were not removed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his last, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was back to a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the great time or importunity of the vicious, which usually preulculils 0 times the bashfulnefs leaving the indigenl virtues. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk down and mast The baby left the military. In Brussels and other cities which they passed, Aubroy was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his compclniori sought the centres of all vico fachlonable; he entered there in all the splrit of the table of fara: he bet, and alwayf gamhled with success, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost even moro that he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, that he encountered the eruption yyuthful novice, or the lvckle ssfclatter of a great family; then his vcry desire seemed to trine the law — this apparent abstraction of the wcls spirit set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than the h alf-mort mouse. In the city of evocation, he left the youth formerly tributary, Tom from the circle, he worshipped, cursiring, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; while many fathers sat friantic, ainidst spoke it looks of silent childreri hunger, without a singular farthing of his last immense wealth, where he even bought sufficient to satisfy their present craving. But he did not take money from the table of play; bul immediately lost, lo the ruiner of mary, the last guilder that he had just snated of the convuls ive grab from the inrocent: this punch. But it was only because of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not able to fight against the trick of the most experienced. Auhrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this arid charity pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed — every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly; how this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various rich sconos of wild nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was close to being the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratitude from him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break the mystery of that, which to his oxidized imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost for some time the sight of his companion; he left it in the presence on the morning circle of an Italian country, as he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters arrested from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were of his guardians, the second astronished him; if he had previously entered into his imagiriation that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they saw enough reason for the bolief. His guardians insist that his friend is ravaged in a harmonious manner, and exhort him, to fight his character is terribly vicious, because possession as irresistible powers of education, makes his licorious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born out of the haste of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratistiori, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had thrown himself away from him of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had had, apparently because of their virtue, had, by his departure, even cast off the mask apart, and had not rescued to expose the deformity of their vices lo lo la goze public.\nAubrey decided on leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a cl singo ori luminous point that to rest the eye. He has resolved not to have a plausible pretext that completely abandons him, in order, in the sense, to look at him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon received, he tried to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose home he was visiting with caution. In Italy, it is sedom that a married woman is met in society; so he was forced to continue his p 1 year in secret; but Aubrey's cye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been named, which most likely ended in the ruin of an innocent, though thinkless girl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and asked him for a roughup of information with respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an occasion; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately by winning a note, to say, that from this moment, he must decrease the line of aseumtion of his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informed him of the entanglement he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also to converge the character to his Lardship. The assignment has been prepared. Lord Ruthven then simply sent a bis servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; bvt did not suggest that no suspicion of bis plans were thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rame, Aubrey headed for Greece, and colocated with the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the faded records of the aricierite glory on the monuments which appearly, shameful to chronicle the deods of Freomen only before the slaves, child hid under the soul Pilonnering thc or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delical, thal sbe could have forced the model for a pairer pouring on canvas the promised hope of the father in Mahamet's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for any one to think that it could be Io going to those who had no souls. As she was deigning on the plain, or tripped along the side of the moritaine, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, enclosing the eye of the nature of animatod, sir that luxurious sleep looks of the costume animal but to the taste of the epicure. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in search of arithmetic, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursil of a Kashinère butter, would show all the beauty of her form, floating as she was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgotten the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of a ber sylphlke police. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, displayed in the ray of the sun such bright and so soothing shades, this might well excuse the freedom of the antiquarian, who let them escape his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Paufarias. But why try to describe the charms, feel everything, but no one can enjoy it ?— It was innocent, youthful and beautiful, not stried by crowded drawing rooms and stried balls. As he drew these remains of what he wanted to preserve a memorial for the next few hours, she stood by, and watched the magic effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe the circum-\nThe upper dance open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of young memory, the wedding pump that she remembered watching in her childhood; and then, turning to subjeots who had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, would him all the pampernatural stories of her nurse. His assiduity and his apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the most intolerant even to Aubrey; and osten told him the tole of living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most expensive lies, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence so that he would follow montbs, his blood would run cold, while he tried to laugh at it by such fantasies idlc and horiblc; but Iclnthe quoted your hiin the names of old meri, wbo had finally detoctod a living among them. After several of their relatives relatives, children had been faunted with the seal of the friends' clppetite; and when she found him so incredvlous, she begged him to believe it, for he had been, remclrked, that thosc who dared to question their existence, always had some proof, bluffle, and to say to him, of the truth. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a beautiful precise disarray of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that it was not the truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that all tended to excite belief in Lord Ruthvens natural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianlhe; his innocence, so contrasted with the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sighed for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself even more and bitten attached to the almost fallacious form before him. He sometimes drew himself from it, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his intention on the vines to adorn him, while in his mind he killed an imago who secreted only the legitimate possessor of buying bis. Iari was inconceivable of his love, and was always the same irifantile free being he had known. She always seized him to tell him of her reluctance; it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could see her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, place with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which was to hold him for a few hours; that they heard the name of the place, they all both begged not to return to the neighborhood, or he did not need to pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, swelling the day had dared, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the rose of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest devices as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to decipher them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly on his excursion; he surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was surprised to find his pupils, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to speak, Ianthe came next to his horse, and won from him to come back, there might allow the power of these being to be put into action ;— he promised. He was, commenting, so busy in his research, he did not keep receiving a total day-light would soon end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is quite unknown; immediately the sun sets, the neighborhood begins; and it moves far, the power of the storm extends above — its thunders echo had barely a resting interval — its heavy rain spread through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet very. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the eritranged forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found thals in the vicinity of a thal mud, by the glacer of lighting, barely lifted from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonting, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him into the city, or at least rely on getting a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent mummerite, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocated mackerel and constant with a laugh, contribed in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder which, once again, took hold of his hoof, he suddenly forced the door of the hut. He got caught up in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He found it if I contact a samo one, which he immediately faked; when a voice used to ,\" Again haffled !\" And he felt that his sons were struck by a force which seemed superhuman to him: determined to sell his life as expensive as he had been, he began to embrace himself; but she was in vain; he was gnawed with his feet, and cast a force against the ground; his enemy fell upon himself, and kneeled on his chest, and laid his hands. upon his throat — when the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole, the light gavo in the day, the trouble ;— he rose up instantly, and, leaving the prey hjs, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They swollen; the first of the Lords fell on the mud wall, and the stubble loaded on the undivided straw of every heavy soft flakes. At Aubreys desire, they sought her, who had drawn out a cry of mist; he was again left in darkness; but what was her horror, that the light of the torches burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his star conductor brought into a corsus without me. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was built a mission coming from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, when he unlocked them, lying beside him. There was no upper oheek colour, not even on his lip; however, there was a silence about hor face which seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived lérc :— at the top of his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the inner pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\"At Vainpy-\nA vampire !\" A litter was quickly cultivated, and Aubrey was laid by the side of her who had been for him, the treatment of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower life that had dictated in her. He did not know what he thought — the spirit was inflamed and seditious to avoid reflection, and to take the refungo in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties, of which 6 had been engaged in the search for her that a mathist missed. Their lamentable series, as the city approached, preceded the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Abercy, and pointed to Corsica .\" They were insolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an inexplicable combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare being that he loved. In another time, he would permeate the maledicoris on his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, flouted at the fact that he had arrived in Athens, and, from a whaler's motion, after hearing Aubrey's fault, immendied himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the lotter recovered from his delirvm, he was horrified at the sight of the one whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by words of bis knd, involving almost repentance for the fault which hod cavsed their separatian, and always inore by the attention, conxiety, and the care that he showed, quickly reconciled with him to his presence. His worship seemed quite changed; he appeared only the apathetic feeling that had so surprised Aubrey; but sounded like his convalescence was beginning to be fast, he gradually withdrew in the same state of mind, and Aubrey pierced rio diference of the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gazec sixed intently on him, with a symbol of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this sinister haunted. During the final stage of the reconstruction of the irivalid, Lord Ruthvon apparently engaged in watching the waves of unfortunates ravaged by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like your monde, the sun without movement ;— in fact, he seemed to wish to clever the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that could once so distinguished now seemed to run away forever. He was today like a lover of solitude and silence as the Lord Rutbuen; but although he wanted him to be happy, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Alhens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he used to frequent, anthes shape stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his slight step seems to question himself in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the uilet rnodest; then suddenly turned around, showed, at bis would imagine, his pale face arid wounded throat, with a more smile on his lips. He focused on sneaky scenes, each feature film of that created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was stifled by the tender care he had taken to come to his illness, till they should visit the parls of Greece neither had yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which recollection could be attached: Although they were thus celebrated from one place to another, they did not seem to be paying attention to what was being looked at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, and the interest in exciteing the generosity of those they defended against so-called dangers. Consequently, neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they traveled with only falcon guards, more to throw themselves as guides than as a defense. At the entrance, at the opening, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the snow precipices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near the pearls, and by the each hoed ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and by placing the behlrid rocks of themselves, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting cries over them advanted, and being expiated at the slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers were to climb up and lact them in the back, they decided once to rush in vain in the sear ch of the enemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his aid; on, rio longer, stands at the distance of the control of his own peril, is soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately tanned up their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to pass on his wounded friend to a nearby cabiri; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence of their, they merely kept the entrance until their comrade resumed the promised sum, for which he made an order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days the inortication followed, and the die seemed to move forward with hasty steps. His conduct and his appearance as a bad riot changed; he suffered as little pain as he had done with the objects surrounding him: but towards the end of the evening his mind rose apparently uncomfortable, ordained his eye often fixed towards Aubrey, who was led to offering a high aid with more than the usual gains —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I do not mean my life. I have heard the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey replied. \"I need a little — my life quickly panics — I can explain the whole — but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free from the mouth of the stairs in the world — and if only the cat was unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"It will not be known. \"-\"Swcar!\" exclaimed the dying man, rasiving himself with extant violence ,\"clothes by all your soul your reveres, by all your nature fear, swear lhat, for a year and a day that you have will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living in any way, anything can be flouted, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with blue socks :\"I clothed myself,\" said Aubrey ;\" He sank laughing on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his acquaintance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his death, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presuppression of some horrible expectation. With his ear rising in the morning, he was about to enter the hoax crying, he had licked the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been stoned by bimseif and comrades, rising his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to this seigneuria, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took the men seriously, determined to bury him in the place where he was. But when he went up to the top, he had no trace of the carp or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were reporting the same stone on which they had laid the body. For a time, the wind was disconcerted in the ejections, but he finally came back, convinced that the bad one buried the good rose for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the land in which he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which they all came in a tame manner to raise this smoky melancholy which had sequestered on his mind, he resaved to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had in mind by referring to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case of connivance with several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. As he looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the style of the healthy that the daggor was untiring in the fatal hut — he trembling — hastening to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror could be imagined when he discovered that it was mounted, yogb particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: they began to look at the body bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the roof and she died were also in splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of ori blood each.\nHe loft Sm yrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigator was about the lady which had watched your snalch of Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune riveted, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. Aubreys indeed became almost shattered so many repeated horrors; it was usually that this lady had fallen victim to the Iantho doctor. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if one was going to save the life of someone he held dearly. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed to be obedient to his will, soon ran away on the shores of the English; and he hastened to the mansion of his satters, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the arid embraces of the bis sister, all the renemorality of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a currency.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning the grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. Here lies the priority of this brilliantity which exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartmerit. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the elevation of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem toarife of misfortune, but of a certain feeling, which appeared to iridate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not so light, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract — just was sedate and pen five. When alone, her face never lightens with a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her favorite sorrows that she kriew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of voluptuclry? It was as if these eyes, a tall face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. He was thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed until the legend of his brother of the continent, where he could be his protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next room of drawing, which was approaching quickly, should be the epocb of its entrance into the \"busy stone\". Aubrey would have stayed in his father's mansion, and fed on the self that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of a shionoble strangers, while his mind had been torn by uniforms to be a bad witness; but he determined the sacrifice of his own consolation to the protection of sister bis. They came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been annoyed as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive, a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the soul of the kingship were quick to do so. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, beware of all the surroundings of him, engaged in the memory of the first that he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that place, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fear of seeing a spectre that would explode, when he perceived, a little distracted, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he entered society. He looked at the limbs almost by refusing to boar the weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, the coach was taken home. He seized the room with pressed steps, and fixed his head, as if he were at the ground, his thoughts were bleeding his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that this was possible — death rises again!! e :— He thought that imagination had condemned the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that he could be real — he determined, therefore, to go back to sociology; for although he was trying to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining insorination. He began to sew nights later, with his sister, at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired in the process, and there gave himself his own thoughts of driving. When he finally saw that the typhoon was leaving, he went away from himself, entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in an omest conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when orie, that he was driving to move, turned around, and revolted towards him lhofofeatures he most odious. And he went forth, and took the arm of his snitch, and, with a grim rush, forced him into the street: and at the door he found himself blocked by the multitude of servants, who were waiting for their lords; and when he undertook to put them down, he heard again that uoeie murmured near him :\"Remember the clock !\" He dared not turn, but, pressed his sister, soon arrived at the house.\nThe Aubrey became distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by the subject oria, how much more complete he absorbed, now than the certainty of the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. The attention of her sister was now without regard, and it was iri vain that she intimidated her explanation that what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only words of birds, and t pipe terrified her. The more he bought it, the more the mare was puzzled. His oath surprised bim ;— Was it to allow his morister to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, almost all that he held dear, and not to the least of his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if Bo broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He sought to use his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, which he rebuked, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only the room of his sister, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. In Lasl, who is no longer able to endure the streetness and the solitu de, he left his house, wandered from the street, your street, blinking to steal the image that bothered him. Her dress became neglected, and which wanders, class often exposed to the sun midday as to the midnight humidity. He was not long to be recognized; at first he returned to eternal life; but at last he helped him to rest where the fatigue had invaded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow them; but they were soon distanced by a bim who fled a pursuer faster than any other – from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left by his absence to all his friends, with a friend among them, of presence, whose they were unconsciously, he decided to counter again the society, irito, and to watch him closely, anxious in advance, in spite of the hif oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached the intrinvacity. But if he entered a room, his hamburger and his suspicion seemed so striking, his inner chills so visible, his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for the love of beer, a society that affected him so strongly. When, commentover, the reinsurance proved to be inavailable, the guards thought appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind became lightened, they took the time hibb to res urne again that trust that had been before introducing upori thein by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to have severe wounds and suffering, he had met daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of thyconsidrous madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take the kernel of bim. He hardly seemed to notice it, if he was completely his mind absorbed by a lerrable subject. His iricoherence finally became so great, that he was confronted with his room. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. He had emancipated, his eyes had saddened a glazed luflre ;— the only sign of affection and recolliction left was his son tongue at the door of his sister; then he was sometimes dazzling, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that seriously affected him, he wanted his riot to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked what he mentioned, his only answer was ,\"True! lru !\" And again, he sank in a state, from which even not she could wake him up. This last of many months: gradually, however, as the year was posting, its inconsistencies became frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, which the Hisguardians observed, that several ilmes iri on the day hc count on his fingers, a number desinite, arid and then smile.\nThe time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his grandparents entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melancholic circumstance of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when bis sisler was going to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy of this brand back to the Internet, whose fear they had that it had been deprived, they deserved the name of the world of Marsden. Thinking that this was a young count whom he had met in society, Aurey seemed to be pleased, and stifled them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be offended by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again olive to feelings of affection. He speaks with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the woman monster had so long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. Fearing him, why did he destroy the resemblance?\nHe looked at her as he didn't understand her, then took hold of her hands, and took possession of a frenetic expression of honor. He told her to swear that she would never marry this monsler, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that that voice still Balehim remembers his oath — he suddenly turned around thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but didn't see anyone. In the arid on-call doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and thought it was only a return from her disorder, incred, and Miss Aubreys forcing, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, he begged one day for your dolay bull for. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, had taken possession of the big spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven was 11 years old in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard about Avbreys ill health, he understood himself again as the cause of this one; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from some of these ainong that he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of the former companion of bis, and, through the constant altendanco, and the claim of great affection sar the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys' car. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of gnawing like an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself ;—coveld still arc, since he knew her, her existence, had beguri thy seeming worry of preorvation, if she were thal inerly he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of Saat, that he would spoil his affections. He obtained an important embassy, which served as an exaggeration to haveten their marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state) which was to take place the day before he left for the Constitution.\nAuhrey, when left by the physician arid bis guardians, tried to bribe those servants, but Iri vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as the hope and rope of their house, to delay but for a second of hours than marriage, he denounced the heaviest cursos. The sweaters promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, they thought that it was better not to harass the spirit of Miss Aubrey by, who he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can more easily be conceived as described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. The Aubrey grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole slowly, leaving a hiin in the custody of an old defenceless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie was outside of the room, and an inoment was found in the apartment where all the water nearly assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately objected, arid, taking his arm by force, precipitated him from the room, without voice fury. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthvenwhispered in his ear –\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come for him. Aubrey could no longer stand; his rage did not find a Vont, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was never held in bed. It wasn't mentioned to his sister, what wasn't present when he came in, as the doctor feared shaking him. The wedding was celebrated, arid the bride and brideroom lost London.\nAubreys weakness increased; blood outpouring produced death symptoms near the approach. He wished that his sister guards could be called, and that at midnight time had struck, to be composedly bound to the whale, the convinced child reader — he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AND ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MIT ISLAND.\nYes.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of the film, where to hate his resting place, and provide his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, aboard one of the ships of Majosty, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of Tbat. The abundance of this place, and the supply of carrots to the oattle and vegetables still have to have there, bring many British ships to visit it — both men of war and merchant; arid although it is rather off the track for the ships bound to Smyrna, its premiums largely cheaper for the distance of a voyage. We dropped; as usual, at the bottom of the child, while the men were used to water, and the sacrillary galloped for cattle with the native TB, the clergy-\nThe man took a rambleto from the cave called Homers School, and other places, where we had before. On the front of Mount Ida (a little moriticle so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English Iord, that he left the days bitter islets precious to our ripvill iri bif felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose your quil Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill of Tbe, facing the river, belongs to him, and he leaves an old man in charge of him: he gave Domiriick, the winemaker, six hundred zoohinef for him ,( about L 250 English currency ), and has been there about bitter months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucoa very often to two different islands .\"\nThis account excited about our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time at the house that our peasant had resided. An old man took us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments located on the ground floor — on the hall window, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green walls, marble tabs on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain below, which could be made for plcly through the by branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small branch Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room, there were half a dozen English choirs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress on the float, with two heels.\nFeeded cotton duvets and pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observe a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the chest of a great Seamari in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaires, Shakespeares, Billeaus, and Rousseau's complete works; Volney's Ruins of Emplres; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock's Mc ssiah; Kotzebues nouels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press at Coristeurople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal with notes, a letter with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old husband said ,\"The lord has taken these books badly in the evening before he sails, and he has forgotten to place them with the tho others; bvt ,\" they must lie there until they resume; for it is so special that I have been to move a tb without swallowing it, he would frown me for a week together; it is indeed very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the gift of this farm, the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zecbincs which I pay to an old Armonian who resides in a small grave in the wood of Tbe, and the nineteenth brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasant. The portico was in front of fifty steps long and four feet of 6 road, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths on working cornices of frets ,( as it is customary now in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the wheels. The roof, surrounded by six years of a stone balustrade of Eight, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awning of a strong coarfed linen. Most of the house slopes are furnished, the Greeks spend their evenings on smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little ftreamlet glissa, grapes, oranges and linden gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two bushes of large bluertle, a marble soot with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, walking, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said this old man ,\"praying\" because he was very fervent ,\" and always started our church twice a week, being side by side Sunday .\"\nThe point of view of this seat was what could be called a bird's eye view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the smoke of which an ancestral Greek temple appeared in the majestic rot. A small storm from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The srnooth sca in the form of glass, and a shadowless horizon by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little from the left, truffled with a uista of high chcsnut and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spraying the light blue wave with spots of emoral green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did this; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the riam of the person who had resided in the romantic solild this: no know his name but Domiriick, his banker, who had a bad name in Candia. \"Armenian\" made our leader ,\"could say, but I sure he will not ,\"—\" And can you, an old friend ?\" \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several part-timers of the secluded lord. He had harassed the young girls when he was last on the island, arid every danced with them at the national party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and arid silk of cotton to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new hoof for a fisherman who had lost his hair in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, for having become a very eccentric character and benevolence. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage to think appropriate riot your discloso. He had a very beautiful daughter, whom Lord Wills often saw walking on the Tube Sea-Share, and he had bought him a piano fort, and took it himself.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination everything on the rack, guessing who was so crawling in Greece covered being. It was obvious: he had a philanthropy of dispositation, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Together with Mr FOSTER, the architect, cl pupil of WYATTLES, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greece ,\"The jridividual,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in iny travels on the island of Tenedos, arid I also visited him in Mityleno.\" We had never heard of the failure of his lord help, as we had been a few years from home; but \"C helped Harolde\" being put in our hands, we re-regulated the reclus of Calcla in surpage. We deeply regret not having been more attentive to our accounting research, but we went to Mitylene some day; but for me that day will never be again. I make this statement ,6 by not completely removing it uniriteresting, and in justice in the right name of his secretary, who is grossly slandered. How a book described as an insensitive provision, inverse to association with human nature, to contribute in the way one to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly required, as can be clearly collected from these small anedotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in his bosomum. Sensitivity, sympathy, arid seem chary to guide all his actions; and his courting of the rest of solitude is an additional reasari to include him as a being on which the religion hoart put his sea, and on whose head Bencvolence hoth threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially with regard to the moral integrity of the opposite man; and who dares to stand before this terrible court where all must cling, only can censor errors towards another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and applause from the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "17": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: however, it does not extend to the Greeks until oster the establishment of the Christianity; and it has assumed its form precstered only from the divisjon of the Latin and Greek churches; to which the idea of becoming prevalent, that a Lat in the body could not corrupt so burned in the territory of lheir, it has gradually increased, and has ensormed the suffering many wonderful slories, still existing, from the dead rising from their graves, and feeding upori the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, all Hungary were, Polan d, Auslrio, and Lorrajne, where tbc belief existed, that vampyres night by soaking a certain portion of the blood of their victims, which became emoose, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while these fattencd human blood suckers – and their ueines became distendo to such a state of repletion, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of the skin of their bodies.\nIn the Journal Londori, of Mars ,1732, is a curiovs, arid, curfew, crediblo account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during the examination ari af the cornmonder-iri-chlef and the magistrates of the place, they asserted positively and in vain, that, five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, dwarf Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, within the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to rid him of Si du mal, by eating from the ground ostho of the tomb of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent Bim from becoming a vampire himself; for about two or thirty days after his death and burial, many people compensate for being tormented by him, and the courage was a mado, that four Persians had been devoured to life by his attacks. In order to avoid other pitfalls, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as it is pleased to be usual cases of vampyrism iri) fresh, and entiroly free of corruption, and emit to the mouth, nase, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the accustomed remedy. A stake was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is ropo-\nHe cried in heaven, as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned the body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the horns of these people who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on the other way to survive them.\nThe universal belief is, tall, a person sucked by a vampire picks a varpyre himself, and sucks in his stomach.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here bound, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations that any other likeness that might be presented. In part, Greece it is considered as a sort of punishment after a deal, for a heinous crime committed when it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but obliged to entrust his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A fupposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut the flame on the earth, as Vampyre sent it, Your Corsica shall crush his tomb; Tben takes hold of the place of origin, and sucks all your race; From there, from your daughter, sister, er, woman, around midnight, he drains the current of life; Yet, away from the banquet that performs must feed your living corsus, Your victims, are yel expiro, Shall kriw with deman for their sire; As the cursed hee, you curse them, Tby flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever for your crime must fall, the most youngest, the most beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a fat... But you must put an end to your task and mark the last ring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glass glancque must see Who freezes his lifeless blue; Thcn with the bare hand will tear Tbe tresef of his hair blow, of which, in life, a lock that thorn the tenderest commitment of affection has been worn — But now is carried by you the material of your agony! Yot with your own best blood will flow; your grinchy tooth, and the hook's lip; then hunting at your tomb sullcn, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until this in horror departs from the spectre more occred than they.\nMr. Southey presented also in his wild but majestic poem of \"Tbalaba\", the core memory of the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having come back to crush the grave with the aim of tormenting it that she loved better during her oxyslence. But this cannot be supposed to have led the sinnoss sram of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and ineriocence. The story of Tournefort gives a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to be an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, raises a variety of anecdotes, and the traditional rhyrotifs his effects, has a lot of essays learned, ten-year-olds.\nding to prove it to 6 th classic, as well as barbaric orror.\nMany curious and interesting remarks about this singularly horrible night of superstition are added; about the present may suffice for the limits of a notc, necessarily devated to oxplanation, and which can now be included by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the only name general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nI happeria that in the midst of dissipations accompanying a London winter, it appeared to the various parts of the town leaders a noblemary, more remarkable for the high singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, just as he could not participate in there. Apparently, the slight washer of the liver only attested his attention, so that he could, through a splash, make him tremble, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who had this feeling of apprehension, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by attaching on the face of the object, not sccm to penctrate, and at a glance your pierce through the inner works of the artery; bvt fell on the cheek with a radius of lead that we have weighed on this skiri, it does not pass. His personalities provoked his invitation to all houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now to the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their present capable of engaging their attentiveness. In spite of the mortal tint of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, either from the blush of modesty, or from the emolion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many of the female hunters after trying to gain his attention, and winning, at least, some rnorks of what they might call affection: LadyMercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters dressed in the drawing rooms since the ber marriage, threw himself in his way, and made ol but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his nativity :— although in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparent 1 attached to her, still it seemed that they were not piggy ;— even her impudence inappalied, arid she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of its eyes, it is not true that the female sex was iridifforent to think: yet this was the apparent calllion with that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if he did not know that she had even overcome the fear of her character of character, or that they had been involved by her apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook him by the vices of hair.\nAt the same time, he came to London, a young man from this nickname. dummy: he has an orphan for fear of having a single sister in possession of a great sweat, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they demanded the greater burden of his mind, your take care of the sub-alterns nercénaires, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, in fact, this feeling of honor and arid high Romani, which every day ruined so many apprentices of thousands. He all wanted to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Providence simply for the pictogram effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of the cottage was simply iri, the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but that were better suited to the eye of the painter and their irregular folds and different colored spots. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and brief: for these reasons, the upstream of his entry into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to write with the East. Trulh their languishing or farfelus favourites: those dauggters to the same lime, by their brilliant faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led bim into false notions of talent bis and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the torch and the wax candles that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was born a real life on the foundation for one of these congreries of pleasant pictures and deseriptions oonted in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, however, a compensatian in his gratified vanity, he was about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of abandoning an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his external objects observation af, thari tacitly aflate to their existenceric, believed by the avoidance of their contact: allowing bis imagination to imagine each thyrig who flattered his propensity your extravagant ideas, he soon forned this object in the hero of a romance, and discouraged to observe the outpouring of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has advanced on every note, that his preserie has always been recognized. He gradually found that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soari found, from the notes of preparation In — Street, he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information about this sirigular character which, until now, has only attested his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations was considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice towards the establishment of equality with the elderly, and not allowing them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous irritations are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill manifested in wearing them. And Aubrey, immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Rulhuen, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of them, which apparently has nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the oborlunicism to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found that, although many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the result offered various conclusions of the apparent conduct moves to him. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their desires. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing that he was not on the virtuous, driven to indignation by bitter misfortunes even on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were fents of lhc daor with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent tight with rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to increase the importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the bashfulful retreat of the virtuous needy. There were circumstances of order about the principality of her Lordship, which was still consumed by her spirit: gripping those on what it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, far from they carried everything either led to the scaffold, or sunk at the bottom and the moft object insery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent cagery with which his companion began to settle in the centres of all the modelible vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro lable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the known scholar was his aritagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but just was always with the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, so that he cashed in the sarno without changing his face, with whomb he generally looked at the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was laid aside, and his eyes were burning with more fire than that of the cat wbilst Dalying with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the youth that had come, to the end of the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many fathers sat frantically, in the midst of the eyes of the hungry mute children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their presbytery. Yet he did not take money from the gourd table; but immediately lost, to ruin many, the last frost that he had just ripped frowns the convulsive catch of the inriocent: he could but back the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which riots, however, able to fight against the coming of the operation more. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and the back to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring his own profit ;— but he delayed — for every day he had drunk his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to bim; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in the bis carriage, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification than the constant excitation of vainly while breaking this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatural homething.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, aridAubrey for a time lost sight of his companion; he left him in daily attendance upon the early epicle of a Countess of Itcllion, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost tamed city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, that he impatiently opened the impationce; then first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; then others were of his guard, then they strangled him; if he had previously entered into the into his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his jurisdiction, they seemed to give sufficient a bit reason for belief. His guardians irisisted on his immediately leaving his friend, arid admonished, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of the irresistible power of seduction makes his licentious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that if contempt for adultery had not been born in the beating of his character; but that he had demanded, for enbanoe hif gratification, that his victim, the associate of guilt, should be precipitated from the apogee of unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, that all the semals which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, from the beginning bis, launched even the mask asidc, arid had not scrupulously exposed all the dogma of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on leaving one, of which the character had not nevertheless showed a point of brighl slrigle on whooh to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning it completely, by seeking, in the sense, to make it more narrower, and not to allow light circumstances to pass. He clung into the circle of sarcastics, and soon perceived, his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whom he was dating with joy. In Italy, it was rarely that a urimclied female was encountered in society; so he was obliged to wear his lips in the dry land; but Aubreys eye followed him all his windings, and soon discovered that an afsignation had been opposed, which would probably end in the ruin of the innocent girl, though insensitive. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked her for his incentives towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of the wait to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he supposed all would have on such an occasion; and after having been pressed if to be destined to marry him, simply laugh. Avbrey replied; and, immediately shouting a note, to say, that from then on, he must decline accomponeing hif Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered fervent bis to look for other apartments, and calli on the other of the Icldy, he informed her all that he knew, not only as regards to his daughter, but also regarding the character of his Lordship. The assignment of the will be prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to warn his complete affairs to a separation; but did not mention any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by the interposition of Aubrey.\nOut of fear of Rome, the Authority headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; the lunatic cold took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of ancient glory on manuments which apparently, shameful to tell the acts of freemeri only besieged the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of failure in Mohammed's paradise, except that the eyes her spoke too much spirit so that someone could belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced on the plane, or tripped along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle, a bad type of her beouties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the Clnimal costumed but to the taste of an epic. The light step of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often would be the inconceivable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed the beauty that is of her shape, floating as it was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, but forgotten the letters that he just deciphered on an almose erasure tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids fall, as she flittod around, expose in the ray of the sun, such delicately brilliant and quickly wipe out the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the same object to had before thought of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passogus in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can taste ?— It was inriocence, beauty and beauty, without the crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls having done so. As he drew these novels, which he wished to preserve in the coming hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would describe the encirclement of the open plain, languish her, in all the brilliant colors of youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to have seen in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects which, obviously, had made a great impression on her mind, told her all the natural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she told, excited the euen inlerte of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampyro, who had spent years among her friends, and the dearest tie, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong his existence. After many of their parents and children reri had been found marked by the starry fantasy of his appetite; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged for him to be, for he had been, roared, that those who scald to question their existence, always had the same proof that abjed thom had with the heart, that he had with the truth. She has detailed him with the traditional appearance....\nof these monsters, and his horror amplifies, hearing a rather crude description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that could not be the truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to linger more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he mocked the idea of a young inanof English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more alienated to the form of an almose fairy before him. He was sometimes tearing himself apart, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he set out, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he found always just impossible to find his attention to the ruins around him, while in his miride he kept the image clean that seesmod only legitimate to possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was a uriconscient of love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she hod rio longer than a single while that she could visit her hants favorous, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragmorit which hod but escapes the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the Vampyref bone subject, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, called with a borror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make an excursion, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all both begged not to come back at night, or it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after that family had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described as the resort of the vampires in their night orgios, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the hell who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them hudder at his audacity to mock in this way, a lessorial power, whose very name apparently caused the blood to freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excurfion unattended; he was surprised to observe his host homolancholic face, and he was confounded to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, inhaled them badly with sucking soil. When he was about to leave, Ionthe carne on the side of the horse, and ardently begged him to return, the night was allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— have promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that the horizon iri there was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all the rabies there on the devoted land .— Since finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is unknown almost; immediately the sun salts, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echoes lhunders had sealedly a resting interval — his thick heavy rairi forced his way through the ogc leaf cover, while the blue lightning forces seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried by the dreadful speed in the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and it rose up, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hotel that barely high with masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to send him to the city, or at least to shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a silent moment, made him hear the terrible cries of a woman who was mingling at the dizziness, mocked with an exulting laugh and continued with an almost intact sound ;— they scattered themselves; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he made a sudden blow, forced the door at the opening of the cabin. He prostrated himself in darkness: sound, inclination, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, although he was scattered, the findings continued, and nothing removed him. He came into contact with someone who he immediately seized; when a voice cried out :\"Agclin baffled!\" He felt struck by one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell life bis as he could, he struggled; but it was ln voin: he was lifted from his feet tight with a huge force again the graunt :— his enomy fell on him, and knecling hovering his chest, had placed his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating through the ball that gave light in the day, he foiled him ;— he stood up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, gripped in a moment the crash of the hranches, as he broke through the bourbier, was no longer beard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incomparable to move, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, and the tufts fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on each straw with a heavy tote. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought who had attracted him to his crimes; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch burst again on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a course without life. He closed his eyes, hopped that just was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same shape, when he set off the cm, strangled by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even upon his lip; but there was a silence obsessed with his face which seemed almost as much attcbbing as the life that the patient lived there :— on his neck and the brat was blood, and on his throat were the marks of a hedge opened the vein :— to this tob pointed men, criling, simultaneousoufy sluck with horror ,\" Aampyre! A vampire !\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who was much to him, the object of so many straight and fair visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his kicks were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to flout the reflection, and the lake refuge in the holiday, he almost unconsciously held in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon by different parties that had been engaged in the other sea, which a mother had massacred. Their lamentable crying, while approaching the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" To describe their cries would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, the arid point ed to Corsica. They were insolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he went call on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a coin he seemed to be begging his former companion of sparo being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and coveted him like his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, at this time, arrived at Athens, and, from the above motive, the ear of the stucco of Aubrey, immediately put herself in the same house, and became consonant bjs accompanying. When he recovered from his delirium, he horrified and stunned at the sight of him whose home image had now been combined with that of o Vampyre; but Lord Rulhven, by his kind words, involving almofl repentance for the total fault had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, the unxiety, and attention shown by him, foon reconciled his presence. His sentence seemed to have changed; it appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but, as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not pierce the difference of the former man, except that he was sometimes caught in encountering his stared gaze upon him, with a grim smile of exultation spreading over his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the recovery of the Invaid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tidal eclipses raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, still sun ;— in fact, he appeared to want to avoid the yes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, has become much weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that he once had so dislinguous now seems to have fled for ever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired him for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he saw him in the midst of the ruins, he had once frequented, the form of Iantho stood his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the mod is violent; then suddenly, refreshing, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him wild by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, to visit these ports of Greek reyet seen. They dragged in all directions, and sought every place to win; and they rushed from place to place, but they did not see what they were looking at. They heard a lot of poachers, but they gradually began these relationships, which they imagined as were only the invention of individuals, whose interest is to excite the generosity of those they defended against the dangers. As a result of this electing vehicle of the inhabitants, on an occosiori they have traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. However, at the entering, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they had the reason to repent of their nogligence; for there was hardly of the whole of the entré engaged in the narrow pass, when they were scattered by the beating of bullets near their heels, and in relation to the threshold of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had started firing in the tool direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering defilement; but shameful to stand thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting shovels, blae their advance, and belng exasperated to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves had to climb above and take them to the rear, they immediately decided to rvshavant in the sea of theeriemy. They had hardly thrown the shell of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which moved him to the ground. Aubrey hastenod to bis assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was quickly surprised by seeing the faces of the thieves the arund — his guards having g, on the fact that Lord Ruthveri was wounded, immediately threw the arms of the thorium and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Auhrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after accepting the purpose of ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, simply keeping the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens training declined rapidly; in two daily mortification was highlighted, and death seemed to advance the hasty steps. His eonducator and his appearance had not fainted; he seemed as painless as he had been the objects that surrounded him: but towards the end of the last cuvée, his mind apparently became unoafy, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was unbelievable for his help with more usual bitterness —\"Assist ine! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I listened to death as if my existence was not like that of the past day; but you can save my honor.\nUr, your friend's honor. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \" I denied, but first of all, my life flourished, I cannot explain everything, because you would hide everything you know, if I had no spot in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I — but life. \"-\" We don't know him. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your fear, that for a year and a day you will not pass on your knowledge of my crimes or my death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see .\" \"The eyes seemed to burst out of their bases ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He ran down and laughed at his pillow, and breathed no more .\"\nAvbrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; the many circumstaneans clinging to this mori lifted up on his spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if it came from the presentation of some horrible waiting for him. Using early in the morning, he was about to put on the roof in which he had left the body, when a thief met Hiin, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself drycomrods, after retreat bis, to the pinocle of a nearby mountain, according to a province that they had given his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of the fir of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place where Jt was lying. But when he had counted the top, he had no place to either the corpse or the clothes, the thieves swore that they were pointing at the identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in the corijectures, because he finally turned back, convinced that they had buried the purse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently coincided to increase this superslitical melancholy which had saltzod on his mind, he resounded to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case of several weapons of offence, more or less acclaimed to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and attractions. As he turned to him, looking at the curious forins, which was his surprise to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastened to obtain more evidence, he found the weaving on, one imagined his rnay of horror when that he discovered that he was equivalent, although peculiarly shaped, the sheath that he had in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for a stealthy certainty: they seemed to look at 6 th bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; hul the particular shape, the same variable shades on the shaft and sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were the cancer of the lady he had tried to pull out of Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune was wasted, and she had not been heard since her secretary had been scattered. Aubrey Mirid collapsed under the horror so unshakeable; he was afraid that the lady of this would have a victim to the deftroyer of Ianthe. He was morase and bounded; he put his only profession in a position to exhort the speed of the postilions, if he would save the first wife of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, who seemed obedient to his will, soon set him on the English shores; and he hastened to dwell as the fathers of this, and this one, for a moment, appeared to the loss, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If the sbe before, by his infantile caresses, had spoiled his cup, now that the wearan began to appear, the sbe was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won in front of her and applauded the rallies of the drawing room. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His eye has never been motionless by the levity of the mind. There was a melancholy about the charm that did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain within feeling, which seemed to indicate a tough soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which stifles where a butterfly or a heart can attract – it was sedative and pensive. When alaria, his face never lightened by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed to his love bis, and went in his presence to forget the whole gri feels she knows that he destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that the eyes of the thofe — that fao then played in the light of the own national sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It was thought by the guardians before that her presentation could be delayed until her brother returned from the conference, when he could be his practitioner. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next salon, which was approaching rapidly, should be the time of its entry in the \"abuse scene\". Arthur would have preferred to stay in the inanjon of his fathers, and fed up with an inelancholy who dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own procession to the protectoriori of his sister. And they came into the city, and prepared for the next day, which was announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — the living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to rest in the kingship's smile, rushed with the third. Aubrey was there with her sister. Let him stand in a corner near him. If he did not take into account the entanglement around him, he prided himself on the memory that the first tyranny he had seen was in that plain, he suddenly fell down by the arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded with the ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had hardly opened your turn, fearing seeing the cl specetore that the blast, when he saw, in a distanco liltle, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was obliged to take a friend's arm, and he abandoned a passage in the crowd, and he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He accelerated the room with pressed steps, and corrected hisharides upon his headman if he feared that his thoughts were inflamed by his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a draconian picture — the dagger — his oath. — He shook himself, he could not believe that it was possible — the ascent unleashed again! e :— He said that he had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It is impossible that it can be real — he determined, Thérèse, to go again in society; because although he was aspired to ask for anxiety, Lord Ruthven, the name hung up on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a marathon, he retired to a recreation, and there gave her to her own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many were leaving, he woke up, and entered another room, his sister surrounded several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. He went forward, broke his arm, and, with a hurry, he forced it towards the street; and at the door he found sons hindered by the crowd of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again that the voice murmured the closet to him :\"Remember your oath !\" He dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, soon came to the horn.\nAubrey became the most distracted. If, before, his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now the firmness of this monster's life leaned again upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now needed, and it was in vain that she intrigued him to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath slew him ;— Was it then to allow this fool to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he loved, did he not resist his progress? His sister could be touched by this. But even if he broke his path, and disappointed his decisions, who would believe him? He laughed at using his own hand to free the world from such a watch; but his teeth, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; he shook in his room, he saw no one, and he went only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his good, to support the picture. Finally, unable to carry a silt and solitudo, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, astonished to steal this haunted image of this. His dress was spoiled, and he wandered, as often exposed to the noon smile as to the midnight humidity. He was no longer recognized; at first he returned to the house in the evening; but at 1st he put him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to sprinkle him; but they were soon distant by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, has slightly changed. Strack with the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enlist again in society, and to watch him closely, anxious to renounce, in spite of the oath of hjs, all that Lord Ruthvon approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his eyes of hook and suspense were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to refrain from masturbating, for God sake, a society that after-\nI saw him so loudly. However, when the remorse proved to be unwavering, the guards thought there was a true lriterpose, and fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain a trust in gain that had been imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nTo save him from the suffering that he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they were insanity, they hired a physician to return to the house, and take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by an earthly subject. His incoherence became so great, that he was confined to his room. There he often lied for days, inexhaustible from the awake being. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a vitreous chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and reminder left displayed somehow at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with the appearances of the severe lyafflicted her, who misunderstood her not to touch the hive. \"Ob, don't let him down, if your love for me is clumsy, don't care !\" But when she asked whom he was speaking to, her only answer was :\"Truth !\" And again he sank in a state, even though she couldn't wake him up. The months last: little by little, as the year passed, his iricoherences bounce less often, and his mind shuddered a part of his morosity, while his guardians scored, than several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of the best guards entering his room, began to converse with his hysioian about the melancholic circumstance of the beingng of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Harry's intention was drawn; he was anxiously asking whom. Glode of this return mark of the intellect, whose fear that he had been deprived, they deserved the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed astonished, and astonished them fell again by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They harassed Nat, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently agony able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the heart of her brother being more alive to the feelings of afaction. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accomplished; when he suddenly picturing a lock on his break; opening it, which was also surprised to bomb the features of the monster who had had if lang influenced his life. He captured his portrait in a paroxysm of rage, arid trampled his foot under. She asked him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, that he would remove him as if he did not understand her, while he grasped his hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of face, he made him swear that she would marry him, for he—but he could not accommodate —he again became inflamed as he was rot voice gave him his oath—he turned suddenly, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him, but did not ignite. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who heard everything, and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and for...\nHe fired her from Miss Aubrey, and fired her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and began to wait, but one day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, having seized his mind, wanted to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the show, and had been reused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he did not begin to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered an insanity, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, one, by the constant presence, and which practice is a great affection for the other bear and interest in his destiny. He gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. What could I resist his power? His language had dangers and a toll to tell—could speak of himself as an individual with a rio-syinpathy with any peak on the crowded earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use Serpenls art, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his career. The title of the older branch fell long to hjm, he obtained an irritating remedy, which served as an excuse to hasten the marriage ,( in spite of his brother's disturbed balance ,) which took place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to tinker with the servants, but in the vain. Ho asked for a pen and paper; he slipped it; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her honor, and the honor of those now in the grave, which once held her in arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the most heclvy curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the raving of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied irimates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be conceived more easily than described, the notes of the preparation body. Camo in the morning, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants takes hold of their vigilance, they gradually fly away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a relationship, was out of the room, and in a moment ring himself in the apartment where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the hive: he immediately appropriated himself, and, taking his arm by force, shook him from the room, without a voice with fury. On the stairs, Lord Rutbven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if my bride is in the day by day, your sister is dishonored. Womori is fragile !\" He pushed him to his servants, who, by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his brother nat, who had found the aeration, had broken a vehicle of blood, and he was carried to bed. This misfortune was not mentioned to his sister, that he was not present when he entered, as the doctor was in the throes of agitating her. The marriage sown, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of near death. He desired his sister's guardians, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated: he died immediately after.\nThe guardians hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Kevin had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the third of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nLONE BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world afflicts her all, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence its guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Grocian Archipelago, one of the ships of his Majesly, in the year 1882, we rushed into the harbour of Mitylenc, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi of cattlo and vegetables to be there, bring many British ships to the visit—warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for bound ships to Smyrna, its premiums pay amply for the deviation or a voyage. We landed, at the base of the bay, and while the men were employed in the watering, and the pure trading for the cattle with the natives, the arid clergy myself took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come to Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before arriving 1 in his felucoa. \"He raised me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he would have given me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am probably getting married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage above the hill, facing the river, bclongf at bim, and he left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zécheries sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ), and lived there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often to the various islands .\"\nThis story excited about our euriasity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening from the house where our countryman had retired. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to them. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a bathroom, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: pl ain of the walls of the groin, table marble on each side, a myrtle barley in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play your through the branches by revising a spring fixed on the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed furniture. In the room stood an English half-cabin doz eri, and an empty blackcase: there were no mirrors or singing points 1. The bedroom had more a large mattress lying on the floor in a table, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed marble reefs. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers which were then in a large box of soaman in the closet: it was open, but we rioted thirik ourselves justified in the examination of the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Roufseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Rvinsof Einpires by Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah by Klopstock; the novels by Kotzebue; the play by Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise by Milton Lost, an Italian editorialist, given to Parma in 1980; and the small pamphlets from the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of no description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord read these books before he left, and forgot to place Thomas with others; but, he said, they must remain there until his return; for it is so special, that if I sent one thing without orders, he would float on me for a week together; there are many others. One day I made him a fervour; and I have the procedure of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty Zecbins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small oo circle in the wood, and that Lord Brugbt here of Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of what .\"\nThe table appearance of the house table was extremely pleasant. The portico at the front was long fistious steps and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marblc canned with black pliths and fret work cornices ,( as it is now eustomary iri Grocian architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. Roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a sinus turkey carpot, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, for the Greeks spend evenings smoking, light wines buying, such as a \"lachryrna Christ i\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little strcamlet glided, rapes, hedges and limbs intertwined on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrlle, a marble seat with a back made of wood of ornamerital was placed, as we are told, the lord spent money after his arid evenings until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and tacking. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed because he was very cute, and that he was always present in our time twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to MontCalcla, covered olive with and myrtle trees in bloom, and orimmit, including an ancient Greek temple, appeared majestic iri rot. A small streumassif from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the slats near Mau-\nRitain's base. The smooth sea as glass, and a colourless horizon by a single cloud, terrinates the victim in front; and a little to the left, through a just of 1ofty chesnut and palm trees, several small if the lands were observed distinctly, spreading the wavy light blue with green emerald bone spots. I rarely enjoyed a more view that I did not do this; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" Could he say, but I sure I won't be,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the bank, we learned several details of the secluded lord. He had worn eight young girls when which was last on the island, and had even danced with them at a female hospital. He gave an eel to a man, flowers to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who lost his own trip a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we have gathered, to have a very eccentric and beneficial character. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage does not have the right to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a piano-strong, and taught him himself the music of it.\nSvch was the information with the which that we left from the peaceful Isle of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, warfsing that rambling to Greeoe could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, arid all these ecricities which brand ecumenical genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the bow, a student of WYATTLES, who had truffled in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he said, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byran; I rent a bim on money travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of this Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calca on the eurey page. Did we not regret not being more curious about our research at the cottage c, but we comforted with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a certain future mainly; but at my hat day the driver returned. I oppose it, believing that he is not interesting, and in court in the name of his secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to the association with the human community, or contributing arduously to foot pain, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be plairily collected from these small anecdoles. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly detected in the pooms of his secretary, came to have their seat in the bosom house. The tenderness, sympathizers and charity seem to guide his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is a strange reason to mark him as a being on which the religion of art has affixed its seal, and over whose head Volunteer has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"rails\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his love or his pleas, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed again towards the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself admits that the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a death-tracking. The character of Lord Byron is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and to avoid applause from the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approval of canscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "18": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition concept that this story is founded is very general in the class. Among the Arabs, it seems common lobe: he did not, however, externalize himself to the united Greeks after the establishment of Christianity; and he did not take his present from the end of the division of Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt so burjod on their territory, he increased graduated, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and the native. In the West, it explodes, with a slight variation, throughout Hungory, Polarid, Avstria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres night imbibes a cert-\nA part of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of erosumplions; while these fattened human blood-svckers — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletiori, as to causo the blood to flow from all passages of jr bodics, and evori of the poref even of the skins of the hair.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious, and of course credible account of a particular oase of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. After an examination of the commander in the chief and rna grates of the place, they declared positively and unanimously that about five years assior e, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pavl, had been heord to say that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he was tormented by a vainepyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the north of the vampire's grave, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days clout his death and sixth, many people complain of having been tormented by the hive, and a deposition was made, that four persoris were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisan) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. Since the evidence was thus obtained, they used the accomplished remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is a reporter for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. This done, this thoy cut off the bis head, put his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measurements were adopted with the those causes of people who had already died of vampyrism, the least they should, in turn, become agents on others which survived theème cm.\nUniversal belief is, that a person sucked by a vampyre bccorns, a vampyre horns, and sucks in its turn.\nChief bailff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems to bet adapted to illustrate the subject of present observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of death aster punishment, for a heinous crime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but copulated to limit his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved the moss while he upon earth – he was bourid by ties of kinship and affliction .— A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the ear, as Vampyre sent him, the corsus half of his back shall be praised; and then haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, in the midst of the stream of life; yet forget the banquet that persecutes shall feed thy livid living corsus, victims of Tby, they shall still expire, are known the devil for their sire; as ye cursed, ye cursed them, thy flowers shall be inlaid upon the stem. But it is the crime that must fall. The youngest, the best flouted of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! You will put an end to your task and you will mark the last tint of his check, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must be blown out Who freezes over they without blue life; Then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life a lock when horn The pledge of fondost Trouble has been worn—But the riow is carried away from your Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinchy tooth, and your hamburger clip; and then harass yourselves on your tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror depart from the cursed spectre of them.\nMr. Southey also presented his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampire of the young girl of Arabion Oneiza, who is presented as having rumbled from the grave with the aim of torching him that she loved better during her existence. But if it cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of her life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tbe veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calrnet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional riarrativcs illustrating his effects, he put forth some dissertations learned, tends to praver him as a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this dreadful superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limils type of a note, recessively dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be conducted by simple remark, that though the term Vampyre is that in most of the Gerrieral acceptances, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of in the various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that in the midst of the accompanying dissipations on a winter in Londori, a nobleman, more remarkable for his abilities, appeared to the courage of the chiefs of the ton, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted its attention, so that it could by a glance calm it, and throw fear into those breasts when a thoughtless ring. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explate from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works your heart too; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead weighed on the skin, it could not pass. His curiosities invited him into all the houses; all wanted to see Hiin, and those who were ill-used by the excitement and weight of boredom were having fun raising something in their presence, capable of attracting their attention. In spite of the tint of her shell, which never gained a warmer tint, nor of the buffoon of modesty, nor of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours were tiring, many female hunters, after notoriety, began to gain his attention, and won, at least, some marks of what they might call the afsection: Lady Mercer, who was the mockery of every monster worn in drawing-rooms Sirice her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but pvt on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his attention :— although in vain :— when she passed before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, he was still as if they were not perceived ;— even ber uriclappalled impudence was bleak, and she left the field. But although common adultery can never influence the direction of his eyes, it is not the female sex that is indifferent to him: yet it is the apparent caution with which he speaks to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that fact knows that he addresses himself to the foetals. He had, commenting, the reputation of a winning language; and even if it was that he overcame the fear of flrigular bis c haractère, or that they were moved by his parent hatrod of vice, he was also often among those women who boast about their fear of their domestic virtues, as among the those who shovel her by their vices.\nAbout the same thing, Thore came to London, a young gentleman from Aubrey's drama: he was an orphan on the left with only one sister in the great wealth of possessiori, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important burden of his mind to the care of the sublateral mercenary, he cultivated his memory more than his judgment. He therefore had this high feeling of honor and frankness, which ruines every day, so many fears of murderers. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice that was thrown by Providenc only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the Romans: he thought that misery and a cottage was merely constituted by the very sting of clothes, which were a hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by the irogular jr folded on various colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the virtues of life. He was beautiful, frowned and rich: for these reasons, upon his entry into gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing favourites or romiring: those daughters at the same time, by their brilliant faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him into false notions of his tales and he laughed at me. Attached as he was to the rannance of his folitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tcllow and wax candles that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffling, there was not a foundation in real life for any bone that congerics pleasant images and descriptions contained in the volumes of thosc, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding the same complement in his pardoned vanity, which was about to give up his dreams, when the extradjnaryster we described above, met him in this career.\nHe struck him; he grasped the impossibility even of an idea of haracler of a mon entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the fact consent to their existence, imp-\nlie by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine too high who flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in the hero of a romance, and to observe the offspring of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He acquired himself with him, paid him attention, and so far, in his opinion, advanced that his presence was always recognized. He learned that Lord Ruthveri asfairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was on the journey. Desiring to give some information about this singular character, which, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to execute the tower, which many generations were necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of skill they have had to make them stand out. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mention his intentions to Lord Steven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem from him, who, apparently, had not iri common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrcy had not had the opportunity to study the harassment of Lord Ruthven, and now found that, though much more of his actors have been expounded to his view, the results have offered different conclusions of the apparent reasons for his conduct. His appearance was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle wanderer, and the beggar, roused with his hand, rhorreth that enough to deliver their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he launched his alms ;- these were sent from the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to sniff out his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink hjm always decept in his iniquity, he was sent far with rich cabarity. However, this was attributed to the greater import of the victim.\necumenical, which predominates generally over the absence of virtuous indigents. There was an inconsistency about the character of her Lordship, which was felt more impressed on her mind: all those on whom it was bestawed, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. At Brufsels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised to appear eagerly with whom his company sought centres of sor to be vice-sashionable; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: to be wagered, and always grenbled successfully, except where he knew sharper was his antaganist, and lhen lost bc even more than he gcliné; but it was always with the same immutable face, with whom really looked at the arorid society: He was not, however, when he encries against the young novician eruption, or the father without chance of an enumerous family; then his very desire seemed the law of fortune — this abstraction applause of the wild spirit set aside, and the eyes sparkled with more fire than the cat beat with the half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the wildly rich youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drowned him inside the cockroach of this friend; WHist mony a father sat fronlic, in the midst of the eyes talking of silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his immense wealth a lotie, where to buy even enough to seal their present desire. But he did not take a nanny from the gamble table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of the Inany, he had just pulled the last girl from the convulsive catch of the Innocent: this night. but was the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often seized himself to represent this in his sling. He implored him to rebuke this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not yield to his own profile ;— but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and open only to him; however, this never happens. Lord Ruth uen in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and laugh Aubrey was near the object of historiosity. He obtained no grafting gratification of him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break that mysteria, which to his exalted immagjnatiori began to assume the appearance of supernatural bleeding.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; be the level in the daily presence on the morning circle of a Countess of Italian, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, the lettenders came from Englari, which he opened with impatience; the sister came from his sister, bowing to nothing but affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he entered into his imagination that there was a bad power in his composition, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his friend immediately eating bis, and urgcd, that his umbilicator was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible power of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous to sociate. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born of hatred of his character; but he demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the associate of his vilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of unconscionable virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the accustomed of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not rescued to expose all the defformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAvbrey determined upon leaving the one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for completely abandoning the bim, purposing, in the Korean during, to monitor it more closely, and not to let any slight circonnetonce without attention. He inherited the same circle, and soori perceived that his Lordship endeavoured to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady, whose mainly home he frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried family is met with in society; so he was obliged to wear his peans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignationor had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an incredulous girl, though tugbt. Having no time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and he constantly asked Hiin for her intentions with respect, insorning them at the same time that he knew that he was meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were veiled, as he believed, and that he would have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry, if he had\nHe wanted to marry her, he just laughed. Aubrey retired; and as soon as he began to attack a child, he said that from that moment on he should refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rendition of their proposed day, he commanded his servant to seek other partners, and called the mother of the lady, informed all that he knew, not only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the character of her Lordship. The assignment prevailed. Lord Ruthven right day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a seplation; but the riot implied any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Avbreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey led his steps towards Greece, and passed through.\nOn the peninsula, he quickly found himself in Athens. He soon took care of himself in the tracing the archives of ancient glory which, apparently, were ashamed to chronicle the act of the free men only before the slaves, had said to themselves by sheltering the ground or many thieves. Under the same roof as himself, there existed a look, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the hope promised by faith in Mohammed's paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much for anyone you thought that she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plane, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, however, one would have the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for those who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the suitable animal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe has often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities of the apnea, arid ofton would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a bulterfly koshrnere, showing all the beauty of the shape of the ber, floating as it was on the wind, lo tbe staring greedy of him, who forgiven the milkcrs that he came from deciphcred on a table almost erased, in contemplation of his figure sylph-like. Often, her glasses fell, or she flirted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and sadistic sadistic shades, he might well excuse the sorghetness of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind, the such very object had been thought of by the vital importer to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the harms that all the senses, but none can appreciate ?— It was insanity, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew the remains of those, he wanted to keep a memorial for his horse's future, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of the horative; she would then describe him the dance rotating on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youtbful mororiory, the wedding sbe remembered having looked into his infarction; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impressionist on his mind, told him all the pennies of his nurse. And often as she told her the story of the ljuant vampy, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and slept tief, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful femcllo to prolong her existence during the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at it from so many idle and horrible fantasies; bul Ianthe quoted her old men, who had detected in Lasl one living among the lhemselves, after several of their close relatives and children had found so unbelievable, she begged to believe it, for he had been pointed out that those who had darod to question their existence, had always had given evidence, which forced him to confess, with grief and heart broken, to confess. She details to prevent the traditional appearance of these monsters, orid her horror was increased, by the pillowrig a pretty description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could not be truth in her fears. At the same time, he marveled at many coincidences that held all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural heathen of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begged more and more to Ianthe; his innocenone, so contrasted with all the affeoled virtues of the women among whom he had saaught sow his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English hospitals, boring is an educated Greek girl, slill he found himself more and more attached to the almost magical form to lull him. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian research, he was going away, discouraged from not returning until his object was reached; but he always had the impossibility to fix a bisatlentlon on the ruins around him, who was in his mind, he kept athal miracle seemed alone the rigid possessor of his lights. Theanthe was not conscious of his love, and will never ever frank the same that he had first known. She always felt repulsive of him, but it was because she had no one left that she could visit her favorite fantasies, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that she had still shaken the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to the parents of a long hour on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, confirmed their existence, the pale of horror to this very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to take one of his excursions, which held him for a few hours; when he heard the name of the place, he begged him once not to come back at night, because he had to pass through a wood, without Greek ever remaining, after the closing of the day, on any regardation. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their noctumal orgies, and gave the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path. Aubrey ranade the light of the representatives of the Jr, and tried to laugh at them full of the idea; but when he saw them shudder at the bis dared throws to mock a picterio, external power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next day, Morniring Aubrey set out on his unattended tour; he was surprised to observe the miracle face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, misled them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and urged him to return. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the day-lit was about to end, and that on the horizon there were some of these spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gathered into a mass of tremendaus, and over all their rage on the devoted amount .— He finally mounted his horse, however, determined to catch up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these outcasts, is almost unknown; I have shortly after sunset, the neighborhood begins: and it had advanced far. The power of the storm was above o—his exuberant thunders had barely a resting interval—its thick languishing rain forced its way to beat the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he carried with a dreadful quickly through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighbourhood of a hole that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves of a dry brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he learned, hoping to find one to guide the back of the city, or at least trust to get a shelter from the pool of the star. As he approached, the thunders, because they were silent, allowed him to hear the terrible shouts of a woman that mixed with the stifled stuffing, exulting with a laugh, conlinuating in the goose almost without noise ;— he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, moaning, guided him. It was apparently not perceived; for, although he had stalled, the sounds continued, and no no police was taken from him. He found himself in the contact with some one, which he immediately faked; when a voice cried out :\"Again gagged!\" to which a loud laugh continued; and he flanked him whose strength seemed superhuman: defied to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but he waved in vain: he was lifted from his feet and was struck by the unalarmed force against the ground :— his enemy dragged himself over him, and began to tremble on his bush, had put his hands on his throat — when he shook the glare of in any tyrehes penetrating through the hole that gavc ighl in tho doy, disturbed him ;— he rose instantly, and, throwing his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mother the crash of the branches, as the tree wood was broken, was no longer the beard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on the individual straw of curry with soft flakes. At Avbreys desire, they sought out his whom had attracted him by his cries; he was again left in the darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of the torbes once more burst upon him, to perceive the early form of his beautiful conductor brought in the lifeless Corsica. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his imagination of the downstairs; but to be again seen the same form, when he closed them, extended to his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even a ber lip; but there was a silence on his face that attaches almost as well as life as the patient lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and upper his throat was the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, sluggishly struck horror ,\" A Vampyre! a vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside the beer who had recently asked him for so many brilliant and magical visions, now flanked by the flower-bone life that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was benvmbed and seemed to run away from the search, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he said almost without consceleration on his hand, a naked dagger from a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search for his woman mother had a crisis. Sad screams, as they learned, told the parents a terrible disaster. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they saw the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and punched with the curse .\" They were inconsolable; but died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirium; in these intervals he could call Lord Ruthven and upori Ianthe — by some combinati nable he seemed to be the beg of his former eophan to spare the being he loved. At other times, he impregnated maldictions on his head, and we were as his doster. Lord. Ruthven, chanoé at the time of the time to arrive in Athens, and, of any inotiue, listening to the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his oonslant wait. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and fertrified by the sight of him whose image he had read by painting that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault which had caused their solution, and even more by the attrition, anxiety, and caro which he showed, soori reconciled with his presence. His sentence seemed completely changed; he appeared only an apathetic behavior that had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the foreign man, except that at times he was surprised to meet his staring staring at him, with a grin of evil exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. In fact, Lord Ruthven became apprehensive in the waves of watching and tidal waves raised by the breeze of the invalid, which marked the progress of these orbs, which revolved around the world of the ovary, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the cyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of the mind that had once distinguished him so distinguished now seen to have fled forever. Today he was as much an Iover of solitude and silence os Lord Ruthven; bvt mueh that he fought for solitude, his mind could not find him in the nelghbourhood of Atbens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had previously sequenced, the forms of Iclntbe beside him — if he sought him in the woods, his step would wander in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; their sudden tuming tour, would show, to his wild imagination, his face pae and his wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, whose failure created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthen, to whom he was bound by the care he had taken of him during his illness, to visit these parts of Greece and had not yet split. They travel in all directions, and fight every place to remember what they could see; but while they hasten from one point to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of thieves, but they graduated bogan lightly these reports, which they imagined that they were the invention of individuals, whose intrigue it was to excite the generation of those they defended.\nIt is about supposed dangers. As a result, only once did they travel with a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. As they entered, however, a narrow file, whose bottom was the 6th of a torrent, with large masses of rocks dug down from the nearby precipices, they held a reclson to repaint their negligence; for they were hardly those who engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bellels near their hoofs, and by which echoes the report of several guris. In a moment, the guards of Tbeir had left them, and, placing themselves with chind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report of Tbe came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shouting their advice, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should go up above and take them back, they immediately decided to rush forward into the witchcraft of the time. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bot in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistance; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his peril, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wound, immediately struck his arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reformulation, Avbrey soon encouraged him to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; arid having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their president — they were happy to keep the entrance until their eomrade returned with the promised blue sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens rapid effort has diminished; in two days death has followed, and death has climbed in motion with rapid steps. His arid behavior had not changed; he seemed unconscious of the pain that he had been objects about him: hurt towards the end of the last event, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, arid his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced to offer his help with more than the usual seriousness —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I heard death if my existence is as small as that of the passing day; but you can save my horror, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" said Everybody. \"I need a little space, I can say what there is, but if you know me, my home was a free spot in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time to learn English —I —I — I \"—\"He will not be known. \"\"Swcar !\" cried the dying man, raising him with exulting violence ,\" I swear to you that by all your nature you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or your dates to any living being in any way whatsoever, what will happen, or what you will see. \"His eye seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sank laughing at his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but fell asleep, and many circumstantials who were present at his knowledge, this man arose upon his spirit, and did not know why; and when he remembered his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, as if it came from the presupposition of something horrible awaiting him. He got up early in the morning, he fought to enter the hospital in which he had left the corpse, queried an inet hirn thief, and irritated him that he was not changing there, after having been conned by himself, arid comprises, upori his retreat, at the pinccle of a nearby mountain, accord-\nThey promised that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took the men seriously, determined to bury him in the place where he was. But when he was mung at the summit, he put neither the corpse nor the clothes in the traco, and the robots swore that they reported the identicol rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, the basic spirit was perplexed in the press context, but he finally re-wrote, convinced that they had buried the purpose for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, set in which all apparently conspired to fight in this superstitlous melancholy that bad seized on his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Olranto or Naples, he himself accuses himself of organizing these effects which he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. As he transformed them and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise to stage a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastening to go further, he found the weapon of Tobe, and his horror could be imagined when he discovered that he was dressing there, the sheath of Tbe of special shape, which he held in his heel. His eyes did not seem to need a certain certainty — they would shake their eyes to be bound to the dagger; however, until he wanted to unravel; but the particular form, the same varied teddy on the arid sheath had been similar in splendor in both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first incursions concerned the lady whom he had tried to snatch Lord Ruthvens seductive arls. Her parents were in distress, the fortune was wasted, she had not known since the secretary's departure. The miride of Aubrey became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; feared that the lady this had been victimized by the destroyer of the earth. He became morose arid silent; and his only oosted oecuation in grabbing the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to savow the life of the suine which he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swayed him on the English coasts; and he hastened the home of his fathers, and there, for a mountain, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of the sister himself, all the memory of the past. If previously, by her innocent motorists, had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon femblies. There was none of this bright light which exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded partent. His blue cycle has never been illuminated by the softness of the miride wicker. There was a melancho.\nthe sacred charm of this one that did not seem to emerge from misfortune, but from some writing feeling, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not a tall light foot, which goes astray where a butterfly or a collar can attract — he was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never shaken by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would raise her presence fargel those sorrows that she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of voluptuclry? He shook as if those eyes ,—thal tace then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had been ready to the world. He thought by ber gvardians more appropriate that his presentation should be delayed until the legend of his brother of eontinent, who he might be his protector. It was now, Thérèse, resolved that the next drawing room, which was approaching quickly, should be the era of inheritance in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and fed melancholy that supplanted him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so strong by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own consolation to the protection of his sister. They soon went to the city, and prepared for the day next, which had been made like a drawer room.\nThe crowd was in excess — a living room had not been held for a long bed, and all the who were eager to get into the smile of royalty, a blanket. Aubrey was there with her sister. While stood in a comer near him, without taking into account all around him, committing himself to the remembrance that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place, he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He had hesitated to turn, fearing seeing a feature that would explode him, when he perceived, a little far away, the stern figure that had drawn his attention to this place upon his first entry into society. He looked until his members were the most numerous to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to force a passage through the crowd, who threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands upon his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would brow from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again begged him — the circumstances began to open — the dagger — his oath .— He woke him up, he might riot that it was possible —\n— The dead rise again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which the spirit rests. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; so he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could riots managed to win insormalization. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a malrori, he removed into a pause, and there gave himself his own thoughts of wandering. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he woke up and entered the enclosure, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he ottemplated to pass and approached her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these traits that he was most atrocious. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her towards the artery: it was the door or he sounded himself hindered by the crowd of servants who were waiting for the Siberian lords; arid while which was committed to passing them, he heard this voice whispering near him —\"Remember your oath !\" — He dared not to turn around, but, in a hurry to his sister, soon arrived at home.\nThe Aubrey became very distracted. Is before his mind absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the living agony of the monsler pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was to gain that she insulted him to explain to him what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His starry oath bim ;—wow then to allow this moribund to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not on his progress? This very sister was touched by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would have believed them? He thought of using his skilful hand to free the fram world such a wretched; but death, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with eyes flowing with tears, work, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear the stones and slitted, for fear that his house wanders the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and which wanders, the bone often exposed at midnight as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening at home; but finally he placed it at dawn to rest when the faligue order took it. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but he who fled from a pursuer was soon dislodged. Driving, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea of being theft by his absencc all his friends, with a friend among them, bones whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, set up watching him closely, anxious to predict, despite his oats, all that Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a trail, his distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was also Iast forced him to refrain from weakening, for his shock, a society that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the Canadians took hold of the interposition, and fearing that his mind would lighten, they thought it was a high time to take over the test that had been imposed upon them before by Aubreyf parents.\nDesiring to save the hair from the irijuria and the sufferings he had daily bewitched in his wanderings, and to protect him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they uttered madness, they engulfed a doctor to reside in the house, and the lake concentrated care for him. He seemed to notice it with ardour, if completely his mind was absorbed from a terrible subject. His incoherence became the last so great, that he was confused by his name-\nThat is right. He often lied there for days, incapable of being awakened. He was compressing badly, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and recollection that appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing hands, glances that afflicted him, he wanted her not to touch him. \" Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is alive, don't approach him !\" When, beyond that, she asked whom he was reciting, her only answer was :\"Truly! True !\" And again, he sank Irito state, from which it was not even so cold that he woke him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was passing, its inconsistency became less frequent, and its mind threw a part of its morosity, which its guardiaris observed, that several times in the day he was going to punch on his fingers a certain number, then srilo.\nThe bad weather almost passed, when, in the last month of the year, once of his guardians engulfing his room, began to coriver with his doctor upon the melanoholy circumstances of Aubrey being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going next day to get married. Immediately, every attractiveness attracted himself; he was hovering towards whom. Happy with this brand of returning intellect, from which they seared it had a private been, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsdon. Thinking that he was a count going with whom he had rent in society, Aubrey some plaids ed, and aftonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They responded to the riot, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brevity, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the spirit of his brother once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to gather his poor marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and each accomplishing; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; the opening he, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who had so long influenced his face. He captures the portrait in a paroxysine of rage, and the pietina under his feet. Upori hor asked him why he thus created the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he had not underestimated it — then by taking hold of his Hor hands, and observing it with a frenetic expression of countermeasures, he told him to swear that she would never marry that Monfter, for he — but he could not advance — it seemed as if this voice began. by hiin remembered his oath — he turned suddenly around, thinking that Lord Rulhven was near him by a far person. Meanwhile, the guards of the physiciari, who had heard everything, and who thought it was only a reminder of his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, desired out of him. He kneeled down to them, he begged, he begged for them, but one day soon. They attributed this to the madness they imagined had taken possession of the spirit, had the opportunity to pacify it, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called this morning after the draw, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood it; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his arid pleasure was hardly hidden from those among whom he had obtained this information. Ho hastened to the house if his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and the interest Iri his destiny, which gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers that could be told: Bimsels were spoken of as an individual who had no sympathy with any bolng ari, the crowded ear, save with her to whom he addressed himself bimsels ;— could say how, since he had kriew, his existence had begun to seem worthy of presentation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing appeasements ;— in the end, know so well how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the long-term elder branch falling to him, he kept an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his deportation to the continent.\nAubrecy, when he was left by the doctor and his guardians, lingered to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked her upon and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, encircling her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for a few hours this marriage, on the whip, he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but when he gave him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to mess up Miss Aubreys spirit by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night stopped without rest at the house of the occupied prisoners; and Aubrey heard, with horror, perhaps more easily conceive himself than described, the notes of preparation well filled. The morning came, arid the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the custody of an old prime impotent woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, and in a moment I found myself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the proud one to perceive him: he approached immodestly, and, taking his arm in advance, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. When ori tho staircase, Lard Ruthven murmured the ear in bis —\"Remember your oath, and kriow, except for my fiancée by day, your sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his entourage, which, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could not support himself longer himself; rabies not finding ventilation, had broken a bladder of blood, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his salesler, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor feared shaking him. The marriage was solemnized, and to be married and married 1st of London.\nAubreys weakness increases; blood efficiency produces the neclr approach symlomas of death. He wanted the guards of his sister to be called, and that an hour of midnight had been beaten, he would tell in a composite way that the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven disapproved badly, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was held before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nSeeing through the Greek Archbishop, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in Year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of curtains of rattles and vegetables to be had there, bring many British ships to Uisit—both men of war and merchant merci; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its blounios only reimbursed for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed to water, and the sacriller was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the clergy. and I took a game to the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small moriticle so named) we met and hired a young Groek of our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island the days before our arrival at bis Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I not chose Paul Mitylene, where I am like a married girl. He was weird, he was very nice. He left him an old man in charge: he gave to Dominick, to the vineyard alone, six zechins hundred for him ,( a currency 60 vt L 250 E English ,) and resided there for about four months, although not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we lost no time in the haste at home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man who was leading us to being a mansiori. It consisted of four rooms on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting room, a living room of 6 bedrooms, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green wolls, martel tables on each side, a large mature in the center, and a small fountain underneath, which could make the braurets play in moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent post-brow; a large sofa or sofa complete the furniture. In the hall, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty box. There were no mirrors or a single painting. The bedehamber had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two quilts of cotton and a bed of corn pillow-toughout Greeco. In Ibe sitting, we observed a marble break. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to extract the content. On the painting of recreation, we find the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boilou, arid Rousseau, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Ziminerman, in the German language, Klopstock Mesfiah, the novels of Kotzebue, the play of Schiller des Robbers, the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; se verol petits pamphlets from the Greek press in Constantinople, a lot lorn, but not in English book of all the description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a person, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"Tobe lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I moved a thing without order, it would frown me for a little bit together; which is also useful. I once made a service; and I took the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except for twenty zeophines which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in the cutting of the cell frnall in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know why .\"\nThe entrance to the house outside was nice. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the flutod marble pillars with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now temporary in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surmounted by the light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine turkoy carpet, brieath a strong coarse linen awning. Most household loins are thus surpassed, as on it, the Greoks pass their ovens by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nFor fear that we would enter the house, a small stream was gone, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shape of two large bushes of myrtlc, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to his sons. \"I suppose ,\" said the old husband ,\" that he prayed far away he was very fervent, and that he was still attending our Twico church for a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of the seat this was what could be torpedoed \"a birdeye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blooming blueberries, hanging on the summil of which a temple of ariclont Groek appeared in the majestic rot. A small current from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the cln horizon inlaid by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a little on the left, through a view of high chest and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of green emorad. I rarely had a sight more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solution: noo knows the name of Billy Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our corilator ,\"I sure he won't do it,\" he said ,\"my old friend, can you say it,\" he said ,\" If I can,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to look at Armonlan, but when we came back to town, we learned to...\nThe details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the normal feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a galc, and he often gave the Greek will to the poor children. In short, it appeared to us, of all that we had gathered, also was a very eccentric character arid benevolent. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the Cabin Tobe, considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought out a piano-forte, and taught him the use of himself.\nThis was the information with which we left the island of Mitylene de Peacyful; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arriving in Palermo, our doubts are extinguished. Falling into the company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greeco ,\"The individual,\" he did ,\" who in you are anxious, Lord Byron; I have it on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had beeri some cars from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pulled in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. Didn't we regret not being more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylenc ori on a day of sure; but to me that day will never come back. I am making this....\nIndeed, there is no harm in believing it and doing justice in the right name of his worship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive decision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or add pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of beauty, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to love their sitting in a high bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and especially the applause to guide all his actions; and his courting on solitude rest of is in an additional reason to mark a bim as a being whose heart, religion has put its seal, and on which the head Bonevolence has tanned his annuitant. No man can circulate the previous \"traits\" without feeling proud of the film as a countryman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not suppose the right to give an opinion. The reports are always attentive to prudence, especially when they are directed against the moral guilt of man; and the one who dares the justice himself before this heinous court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a funeral. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in scrutinizing, and flouting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virus and self-approving heart conscience.\nTHE END!\nGjllet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "19": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Poidori.\nTHE superslition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Arabs it seems to be commori: it did not, however, extend senclf to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it only assumed just a present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried on their territory, it gradually incrusted, and formed the subject to many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the bone the yaung and beautiful bone. In the west, it spread, with a little variation, throughout Hungary, Po 1 and Austria, and Lorrain, where the cxisted belief, that the vampyres soaked in harm by a certain port of thorium blood uictims, which mingled, I0 their strength, and died rapidly of consumption; while these human blood suckers were fattening—and their veins became distilled to suck a structure of repletion, to cause the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even from the pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible, accruing to a particular case of vampyrism, which is started to take place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the chief and magistrates of the place, positively and unanimously asserted that about five years earlier, a cortairi Hcyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been harassed to say that, at Cassvia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, by eating from the sorno of the earth of the tomb of the vampy, and by rubbing himself with lime blood. This precaulion, however, did not prevent him from becoming an avampyre life; for about twenty or three days after his death and his hurt, many people complained of being tortured by him, and a statement was made that four people had been depraved of life by his attacks. To prevent further malice, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as is supposed to be useful in cases of varnpyrisrn) frosh, and completely free from corruption, arid emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they ran the habit. A pole was completely led through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have shouted as sadly as if he had been set on fire. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into the grave. The same measures were adopted with correct people who had died previously curly vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should be some agents on the others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems that better adapted to illustrate the factor of current obsequences than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a sort of dead punishment after, if there is a heinous crime committed while there exists, that the deceased is not over 1 y do0 med to vampyrise, but forced to limit the iridescent visits only to those beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he fights by ties of kinship and affection .— A suppositori alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, af Vampyre sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre; and when thou hast haunted the place of origin, and sucked the blood of all thy wreath; and from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, at midnight drain the stream of Iife: yet hate the banquet that shall draw thy living soul, thy victims, even thou shalt perish, and know the devil for their life: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursed them, Your flowers are darkened on the stem. But he who falls for your crime, the youngest, the most beautiful of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your lame heart! You must put an end to your task, and you must mark the ringing of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glass glucence must see which sreezes over his lifeless blue; Theri with the unhalifted hand must wear the braids of his yellow chair, of which, in life, a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn — But now is carried cheerfully by the Memorial of your agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning lip, and your harging lip, and hunting your tomb, Go, and with Gaulf and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from more cursed spectra than they.\nMr. Suthey chls also introduced in wild but beautiful bis Poein of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr course of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave to torment him. She is the 6 most loved one when she exists once. But this caririot body supposed resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it was spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tourncfort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri, his great work on this subject, besidos, a variety of anecdotes, traditional narrativetiff illustrative of its effects, put forward learned dissertatioris, tending to prove that it is a classical cal, as well as barbaric error.\nAlthough the present rnay suffices for the iimits of a note, which is unjustly devoted to exploration, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre if that in the most fanciful acceptance, it arogates several other syrionyms which make use of in different parts of the world: like Vroccolocba, VardouCocha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of a London winter, he appeared to the various parties of the dethoton leaders, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than for his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if we could participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who fell this feeling of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the object, did not seem to be pentrotering, and put on a look to pierce inside the work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. If he was charged in all the houses, everyone saw him, and they had been accused of excientity, and now felt the weight of the enemy, we were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their alternance. In the epile of the mortal tint of her face, which never gained the guerilla tint, either of the bouffon of modesty, or of the strong emolion of passion, the form and the exterior were beautiful, many women hunters aflora notoriety aspired to gain her ottensions, and to gain, at least, some marks of whom the term might love: Lady Mercer, who had been thomackery of each mors iri drawing-rooms shewed from his mar rigle, thrown into himself, and everything except put on the robe of a mountain, to omit her opinion :— although in vajn :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived ;— cend her impudence impuded inappluded whos baffled, and she left the field. But although the female adulter could not influence the ability of his eyes, it was not because the female sex was indifferent to him: yes, it was the apparent action with which that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew how to address the homeless females. He had, rainbow, the reputation of a winning language; and if just was that even he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like howteri among these females who formtho vanter of their scx of their domestico culture, as among those who venture it by their vicos.\nAt the same time, a young man named Aubrey arrived in London: he was an orphan for fear of having a single sister in possession of a great well-being.\n, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. For fear that the guardians, who thought that it was only to take care of his fortune by the lake, would renounce the importance of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he loves his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this feeling of honor and romantic frankness, a huge, which daily ruins so many apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was lhrown ln by Providorice simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see it in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage was limited to the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the paintlcr by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of pets were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank and rich: for the reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to decipher with the truth of real their favorite languishing or blushing: the girls at the same time, by their brigant cauntains as he approached, and by their dazzling eyes, when he opposed his lips, soon led to false notions of a talentf hif and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his spiritual hours, it began to find that, except in the caridles of tallow and wax that twinkle, born of the presence of a ghost, bul of the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these assemblies of plaidslring images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed the hif study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked bim; and the very inconceivable to form the idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who had other signs of his observational extemabjects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their conlact: to allow his lincgination to imagine everything that was wilting his propensity lo extrovagagant ideas, he soan formed this objeot irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rattling that the person before hiin. He became acquainted with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced in his opinion, that the presence was always re-echoed. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and he soon discovered, from the notes of preparation on the street, that it was abominable to trade. Desiring to obtain information about this singular character, which, until now, had on him curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for bim to perform the tour, while for many geriatrics has been sinil neotrying to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of violence to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not allowing them to appear as if falen from the sky, quander s candales intrigues arc mention af les sub-jocts of pleasantry or practice, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately deserved his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Fl atterod by such a brand of cream of him, wbo, apparently, bad nothing in common with other meri, he accepted with pleasure, and in some doy they had passed the circling waters.\nHowever, Aubrey had not had the opportunity of a Lord Ruth...\nThe character of, and now it has found that, by far more of its actions were exposed to its point of view, the results offered different conclusions, fret the apparent olives to its conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle vagabond, tbo, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey did not avoid remembering that he was not on virtuous tbe, reduced to indigenco by the mesfortuncs even attend to the virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were scint from the door with sneezes barely removed; bul when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to wall up in hif lust, or to sink him deeper into his iridquity, who was sent far with rich charity. It was, he commented, attributed by him to the grafting importunity of the vicious, which, in general, predominates in the retriring bashfulness of the virtuous indigent. There was a message about charity towards her Lordship, which was even more impressed in her mind: every place upon which it was granted. Inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all either led to scaffolding, or sunk at the bottom and the moss abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrey surprised the apparent ardour with which his companion sought the centers of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in every tbe spirit of the Faro table: he bet, arid always won with success, except where the best known struck his antagonist, and then he lost more than he won; but he was still with tbe sarne around: it was not, however, when he heard the eruption young novice, or the fat without chance of a family of numbers; then he wanted to strengthen the law-this abstraction applicant of the mind was put aside, and his cyes were shining with more fire than that of the cat when dclllying calling with the half-dead mouse. In the city, he left the old easy youth, Tom from the pillow, cursed, in the solitude in the midst of a dungoo, the fate that had attracted him with the reach of this friend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farth of his immcense delay weather, or with it to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take a money from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last bo gorilla had snapped from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, who waf riot, however, able to fight the cunning of the rhore ex-perienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he jumped his friend and gave him an opportunity to scroller freely and only to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, to be granted no gratification more gratification of him than the constant excitel of finally wanting to break this inystry, which to bis exalled imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost for a while the sight of his companion; he left the bim in daily attendance in the morning circus of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memorials of another deserted city. While he was engaged, letters came to England, and he impatiently penetrated; the first was from his fist, wielding nothing but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter stunned him; if he had previously inherited in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough reason to believe. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and urged that his character to be terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction was more dangerous for solitude. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been generated by the hatred of his character; but that he had badly demanded, in order to revive his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of the careless value, to the lowly abyss of infamy and degradation: in flne, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the account of their value, had, since his departure, cast aside evon the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of vices lheir to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which ch to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon the hiin completely, purpasing, in the way, while, to watch him more closed, and not to let pass any light circumstances without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, tells the Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady of Tbe, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for a woman who is urimarized to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubricky eye followed him in his windings, and soon distraught that an assignment had been attached, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, a hard girl without thought. Not wasting time, he entered the apartment of Lord Ruthven, and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he knew that he was hating her very close. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were as he assumed.\nsed all would have on such an oocasiori; and on being prefsed whether he intended to scam it, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, he must disappoint from that moment on the accompaniment of his Lordship in the remote of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seek further application actions, and calling on the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven Riexl day simply sent his sergeant to inform his complete penalty for separation; bul did not suggest any suspicion of his plans having been foliod by Aubrey interpretation.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed a hif marched to Greece, and crossing Penjnsula, soon found himself himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house type of a Greek; and soori himself took care of himself by tracing the faded reeds of financializes glory on the moriuments which, apparently, enticed to chr onicling the acts of freemon only before the slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so attractive and delicate, that she had formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases, the promised hope of a beautiful bone into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of mind so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. Dancing on the plain, or tripping on the side of the hill, it would have been thought that the gazele a type of p0 or its beauty; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this sleeping luxury look of the animal svited but to the tasto of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, shows all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind tho, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he had deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the context of his figure of sylph. Often her braids would fall, as she felt around, expose in the ray of the sun, such deljcately briing and quickly erase himself hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who first and escape from his mind, the object even that he had previously thought of the vital importance of your proper separation of a passage in Pausanjas. But why try to describe charms that are all seen, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youlh, and casty, vuntucated by aridstifying ball drawing rooms. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to prepare a memorjal for his future hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of his pencjl, tracing the socnes of his place of origin; she would then describe him the circle dancing on the open plain, painting, to him in all the brilliant colors to the youthful inemoratory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having looked at in his information; and then, turning to subjects that obviously bad Mado a great impressionnerjon on his mind, would tell in all the supernatural tales to his nurse. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the ties of dcarost, forced each year, by attaching herself to the life of a lava woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, his blood was running cold, he tried to tear him from such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ionthe quoted him the names of old men, who had, in the end, elected an old marriage themselves, after several parents and children heirs had been found marked with the seal of the apity of the friend; and when she found it so incredible, she begged to believe him, for he had been pointed out that the discorders who had debanded to question existence, had always had evidence given to him, that they had been obliged to do so, and that they had had a broken heart. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still priest persuading her, that there could not be true in the fears of the beer, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to exoile or believe in the punctual power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling to Ianthe and even more, his innocence, so caught up in all the infected virtues of women omong that he had soughl for his vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a girl Greek uneducated, he found himself even more attached to the almost magical form of TB before him. He sometimes moved away from her, and, sleeping a plari for the antiquarian somo search, he left, decided the riot to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained a total fixed image only legitimate to possessor of his rights. Nathan was not capable of his love, and had never had the same infallible frankness that he had known for the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was him because she didn't have longer clny with whom she could live her favorite bluffs, while her guardian was busy in the skelching or the discovery of a few frogs whooh helped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of Vampyros, and both, with the present several, affirmed their loneliness, peace with horror in the name itself. After Saon, Aubrey decided to make his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both not to come back at night, because he had to go through the wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration.\nHere, we go. They described it as the resart of the vampyres in the night orgies of their, and denounced the heaviest evils as improning on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey praised their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal power, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattended on his conclusion; he was surprised to obscure the melonchole face of the host death, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. Ianthe, whom he was about to leave, came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him for a return, and allowed him to put the power of these action beings ;— he promised. He was so busy in his research that he did not perceive that the daylight was going to stop, and that iri tho horizon there was an af these spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly assemble in a mass tremendous, and pour out all their rage towards the devoted land .— He at 1st, However, climbed his horse, determined to catch 6 th speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in this southern climate, is almost unknown; immediately the sun feels, the night begins: and it had advanced far. The power of the storm was above — its failing thunders had barely a resting interval — its thick heavy rain forecasts path through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to be running out of breath and radiating at its feet. Suddenly, the horse became afraid, and he was carried with terrible cruelty through the tangled forest. The animal at the point, through the fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glabre of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hashish which hardly lifted up the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Despite, he approached, advanced to finding someone for the guide in the city, or at least relying on the ability of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shrioks of a woman who mingled with the stuff, the exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost eye-free sound ;— he was surprised; but, blushing the thunder that was raging again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remarks were made by them. He found himself in a contact with someone whom he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out :\" Again gagged !\" to whom a loud laughter took hold; he felt overwhelmed by the one whose strength was found superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his onemy threw himself on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his haris in his throat — when he glamorous torches rnany penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;— he instantly pink, and, leaving his prey, moved through the door, and in a moment crashing branches, as he broko through the wood, was no longer bearded. The storm was still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the lhatch loaded on each individual straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubrey's desire, she was sought out, who was dragging him with his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his orror, when the light of lorches once again burst upori him, to marsgray the cliry form of his beautiful conductor brought a course of liftles. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an amazing vision of his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no color vpon cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence about his face which seemed almost as attached as the life that once inhabited the threshing :— on his neck and chest was blood, arid on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men ponted, wandering, simulariely struck with horror ,\" A V ampyre! A vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was posed by the sido of his who had heard lately was the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within. He did not kriew what he was, his mind was rocked and seemed to have reselection, and lako refuge in vacclincy, he held unconscious alarms in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the heat. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her that an annuitant had missed. Their unthinkable cries, as they approached the city, signalled a terrible catastrophe. \"That would be impossible to describe their gift; but when they became the client the cause of the death of their child, they did so in Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was severe with a very violent fever, arid was often delusional; in these circumstances would call Lord Ruthven and on Ianlhe—by an incomprehensible ocombination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. To other linden trees, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven went there to arrive in Athens, and according to whatever motive, in carrying in the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant landing. The letter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and starred by the sight of him whose image he now had with the end of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the false It which had caused separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. But as soon as his conualescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey pigeiced no difference from the former man, excepts that sometimes he was surprised to meet his eyes fixed undisputedly on him, with a smile of maciovs exultation playing upon his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the recovery of invalid, Lord Rvthven will apparently engage in monitoring the waves without tides raised by the cooling creoze, or by marking the progress of these orbs, circumcise, like our world, the sun without movo ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys mind, by this sbock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had such a distinguished mind that now seemed to be running away never sore. He was now as lovers of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; as he is for solitude, his mind could find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the vines which he had once frangled, the shape of Ianthe stood on the side – if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of modest life; then to turn, would show, to his wild origin, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He decided to steal scenes, each feature of which created bitter fuch associations in a big esprit. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tendors' care, to take him during the disease bis, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had seen again. They went in all directions, and searched for all places where a renown might be set in motion; but they hadtened from one place to another, but they did not seem to listen to the battle they were watching. They heard many robbers, but they begged little by little to diminish the relations of lasc, which they imagined to be only the indiv individual invontion, whose interest was to excite the generosily of those whom they defended against the preterized dangers. As a result of neglecting the inhabitants, one day they traveled with a few guards, more to serve as guidos than to defend. At the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocky drafts coming from the nearby precipices, they had the reason to repent of the reliability of the air; for there were few members of the party engaged in a narrow pass, they were surprised by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by account of several guris. In an instant, the guards were afraid to have them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to be in the direction from which the report came. Lord Rulhven and Aubrcy, imitatiring their example, withdrew for a bit behind the sheltoririg tower of defilement: but shameful to be so guarded by an enemy, what with insulting cries told them to hang, and being exposed to a slave without resistance, if one of the thieves should climb above surd lake iriod at the same time to rush in search of enernia. Hardly, they had lost the belt of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought a ribbon to the Grourid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer being the object of the contest or of his own peril, is soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately thrown his arms and svrendrod.\nBy the promises of a great ravine, Aubrey soon pushed them to throw his wounded fried into a nearby hut; and having accepted a ransom, he no longer cared about their presence, they contented themselves with merely to keep the entrance until the comrade their returned with the promised sum, far from where he had a scam. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to be accommodated by basty slops. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as insensitive to the pain as he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often attached to Aubrey, who was encouraged to offer his help with more than usual caresses —\"Assistant! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I have taken into account my existence as little as that of a Passiriring day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. —\"Ineed full little — my life flies quickly — I cannot explain the whole — but if you would hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — would if my death was unknown for some shooting in English —I—but life. \"—\"He must not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying husband, rising up with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, whatever happens, or what you can see. His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey, he laughed at his pillow, and no longer breathed.\nAubrey rested, but didn't sleep; the many circumstances attending his knowledge of this man rose on his mind, afraid he knew not. Why; when he performed his oath, a cold chill came upon the bomb, as if the presentation of something horrific was waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when O Robber met Hiin, and informed him that it was not long there, wailing down from his sons and comrades, at his retirement, to the pirinacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they gave evil to his secretary, that he should be exposed to your first cold ray to the moon that shaves after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and took several of the men, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. But, whom he had climbed to the top of the shoe, found no trace of the clothes or clothes, although the thieves swore that they were penetrating the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his mind was stunned by conjectures, but he returned to Lasl, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nLosing a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently aspired to raise this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon adorned at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto, or Japanese, he took advantage of it by fixing the efforts he had by making him belong to Lord Ruthveri. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of attack, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. When he turned them around, and looked at their curious forms, which was surprising to find a sheath adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in fatal hut then — he shvdered — rushed to win the furious proof, he found the weaving, on his horror can be imagined when he discovers that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not lack any other certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular form, the fame of the shoots on the hast and the sheath were similar in splendor on both, and I have no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each one.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the way back from hjs, Clt Rome, his first investigations were about the bad lady hc with the intention of extracting the educational arts from Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard of the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this cold had caused a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his only possist job is exhorting the speed of the pastilions, as if he were going to save the life of the somo that he held dear. He came to Calais; the breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tied him to the English parts; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to the loft, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the remembrance of the past of the lho. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more saddened as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning the graph that won her eyes on the applause of the salon assemblies. There was no light brilliance that exists only in the cured atmosphere of an annoid apartment. His blue eyes were never illuminated by the reindeer's levity. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not seem to emerge from misforturia, but from some sourling in it, which seemed to indicate a sub-conscious of a brilliant kingdom. Except not was that light foot, which strays where to wear a butterfly or color can attract—it was selected and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by the brightness of joy; but when her brother breathed in her affection, and her presence would forget the pains that she knew to destroy her rest, who could have harassed her smile for voluptary? It seemed if those eyes — that face then played in the light of their own native speaker. She was still eighteen years old, and had not been brought to the world. It had been thought by her guardian more in shape that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned fraternizing the continent, when she could be her professor. So it was now solved that the next drawing-room, which was rapidly approaching, should be the time of his entry in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey prefers to stay in his father's house, and feeds on the melancholy that surpasses him. He could not feel the interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit of hjs had been so torn by the hadents having wilnes used; but to be discouraged from sacrificing his own comfort to the protection of this sisler. They came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been dished out and a living room.\nThe crowd was in excess — a third-room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened to go. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the thal of remembrance, the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place — he just felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, smiled at his ear —\"Remove your oath .\" He was having trouble with the turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would make him lose, when he pierced, a little distance away, the figure of the same that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked up to 1 hls like almost refusing to carry their weight, he was forced to take the tick form of a friend, and to predict a passage through the crowd, to be thrown himself into the hls car, and was driven home. He hastened with hasty stops, and six of his barrids lifted his head, as if he had sighed that his sighs were bursting out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in the dreadful picture — the dagger — his oath .— He himself, he could not be as possible — death rises again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; although he tried to ask for the indictment word. Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his fisher to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated to a reef, and there he prepared for his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that many were leaving, he awoke and entered another room, and found his sister overwrapped by many, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed his spankings to him. He hates the foam. And he took his sister's arm, and hurriedly he swept her into the street; and at the street he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged, he heard this voice murmuring again near Hiin :\"Remember the oath of Yaur !\"; he dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, he soon came to his home.\nThe Aubrey became almost distracted. If, before, his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more complicated he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the amateur love binds a pressed gain on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer heard, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and he terrified her. The inority he thought was that he was more obsessed. His oath surprised him ;—did he say to let this monster wander ,6 to ruin himself on his chest, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. If he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought of using his own hand to fear the world brake such a wretched; but doralh, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in a big room, he saw no one, and he only struck his sister, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, I was more able to support flillness and loneliness, to loft his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humidity of the middle. He was no longer recognized; he first came back with this house; but finally he set him up with your regret where fatigue overtaken him. His sister, anxious for security, entertained people to follow him; but they were quickly removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – from thought. His conduct, howling, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea left by his absence, the offering of his friends, with a friend of the arnangst, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to again attract society inta, and wate closely, anxious of frewarn, in spile of this oath, all that Lord Ruthveri has approached spiritual intimacy. But when he entered a room, bis hagard and the suspicious glances were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for the love of the heart, a society that affected him so strongly. When, commenter, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the guardians took hold of intrusive, and, fearing that the bis spirit would become alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that was previously imposed on the train by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to drunken him with wounds and suffering which he had every day encumbered in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they oonsided madness, they built a physician with rosid in the house, and constantly take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, so his mind was indeed observed by the subject one terrible. His incoherence was so great that he was confined to his chamber. There, he often spoiled himself for a daily, unable to be attracted. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glassy luster ;— the only sign of affection and remembrance was manifested on his sister's entrance; then which would begin something, and, grasping his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he misunderstood her from not typing him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near Hiin !\" When, however, she asked whom he resisted, if only the answer was :\"True! True !\" And again, he fell into a slate, that she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: gradually, however, as the year passed, his iricoherences became less freckled, and his spirit softened part of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the day he counted on his singers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe dynasty had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of the guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor on the circumstantiated melancholy of Aubreys being in such a horrible situation, which went his sister the next day to get married. Undoubtedly the attentiori words of Aubrey attracted; he asked anxiously to whom. Happy to have marked the return of the insect, whose they feared that he had been deprived of beer, they mention the name of the Count of Marsderi. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought that his brother was once alive with feelings of affection. He began to flatter himself with all his warmth, and to congratulate his brother upon his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and arduous accompaniment; who suddenly he piqued a medallion on his chest; open it up, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced him for so long. He split the portrait into a paroxysm of the crogo, and trampled it under foot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed her future husband's refemblancc, to be looked at as if he had caused her to riot—then seize her haries, and gastirig on her with a frantic expression of coventenance, he said that she would never marry this gentleman, for he—but he could not advance — it seemed that this baye bim voice remembered his oath—he suddenly turned, thinking Lord Ruthven was near him but no one. In the medicine, the guards and the doctor, who badly bearded the whole, and thought that the cewaf but a retum of bis disorder, entered, and Miss Aubreys forcing, wanted her to be the hair. He fell on his larn knees. He implored, he raised the line to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this your madness that they imagined, could take possession of his mind, wanted to pacify him, arid retired.\nLord Ruthven called The morning after the shooting, and bad incn refused all the lessons. When he became aware of Aubrey's health, he realized that he was the cause, but that he was taught to believe that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be attributed to those among whom he did not gain this training. He hastened to go to the house with his former companion, and by a hard presence, and by a great affection for his brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually became in the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His long life had dangers on toil to rocount—could speak of himself as a individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with her that he addressed himself ;—could you know how, since he knew her, her existence, had gone to seem worthy of conservation, if she simply wretched that he could listen to his soothing appreciatives ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, that he gained beautiful affections. The title of the former Banncb was given to him at length, he obtained an Irish embassy, which served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ), that it took place on the eve of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the fervents, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; they gave him help; he wrote a letter to his father, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own fault, her owl honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, that one day he held her in their arrns as the hope of Ibeir and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this weeping, when he denounced the heaviest curses. The promised servant they would deliver; but give it to the doctor, so it is better not to harass Miss Aubreys spirit any more by, equal he considered, the raves of a maniac. The night did not rest for the busy inmates of the house; and Auhrey heard, with a horror that could be easier to conceive than described, the notes of the busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Everybody grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of a helpless woman. He took the opportunity, if a sound had come out of the room, and in a moment, it was in the apartment where all of them were 16 immediately assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him with rage. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your path, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, that Sister Yaur was dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the elder wife, had kidneys of him. Aubrey could no longer support his sons; his rage had not found a vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. It was the first mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as physiciari, was afraid to shake him. Marriage was celebrated, and the bride and brideroom left London.\nIncreased the weakness of Aubrey; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister guardians to be c allod, and when midnight had struck, to be bound in a composite way that the reader would persisted — he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubrey Fister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING A ANACCOUNT FROM THE RESIDENCE OF LDRD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world stands before him, the hero will choose his place of rest, and the guide of Gravity .\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty's vcsel, in the year 1812, we put into the port of Milylcne, on the island of this dwarf. The beouly of this plagiarism, and the supply of certain cattle and vegetables still at the 6th had there, led many British vessels to visit him — both men of war and merchantinen; and although he rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums paid a great deal for the deviation from a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was watered, and the shipowner negotiated for the cattle, the natives, the clergyman, and the inyself took a ram in the cave called Homer's School, and in other places, where we were here. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we had the spirit and engarod a young Greek like our god, who told us that he had come from Scio with a lord of the English, all the Finland four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and should have given me with him; but I did not choose Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his office very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account exudes our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste any time hastening to the house where our peasant had resided. An old man who led us over the mansion has gracefully accelerated us. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were simply decorated: green coloured walls, marble lables on either side, a large myrtle in the center, and a benothed srall fountain, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed in the small brorize cl side Venus in a lean posture; a large hood or sofa camplotted furniture. In the hall stood an English half-dozon of the cane chairs, and an empty k-case boo: there were iron mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedehamber had only a large rnalter spread on the ground, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a plow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation, once, the old man said vs, flipod with books and papers, which were then iri the breast of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the content. On the tablet, the hives of the Empires of Voltaire, Shokfpcare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of Volney; Zimmerrnan, in German; the Messioh of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press al Conslantinaple, much to nr, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. That Messiah was literally scratched also, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe man said :\"The Lord had been living these books in the evening before he defiled, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for he is so special, if I had put something without order, he would frown on the rene for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I once did him a service, and I had the product of this farm for the trophe of the carca oss, except twenty zechins that I paid to an agonized Armenian who resides in a small hilling in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the outer house was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty steps long around fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and streetwork cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof of the tobe. The roof, surrounded by a balustrade with light stamens, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an warning of strong coarse linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, as on learn the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left of Tbe, while we were closing the house, a small brook slipped away, grapes, oranges and lime trees were embedded together on its borders, and under the shade of two large bushes of blueberries, a marble seat with an ornamental wood background was placed, on which we were told, the Iord passed many of his evenings lingered until twelve hours, reodating, writing, and aligning to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what we could call \"a bird view\". A line of rich vincyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, surrounded by olive trees and blueberries, and on the top of which a temple of Greece appeared in the majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was the last rain, the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth fea like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by an island of fins, finished the view in front; and a little on the left tip, through a sight of hazelnuts lofly and palm trees, small fevorous islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with emerald spike spots. I rarely liked a view more than I did; for our investigations were without results as to the name of the person who sold out in this romantic solitaire: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armerian,\" said our conductor ,\"could say it, but I sure he won't say it,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" said I —\" If I can, do it, I dare riot. We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but a return to the city of Ibe, we left the sovereign details of the ifoliated lord. He had a bit eight things girls when he lasted on the field, and everyone was dancing with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who badly raised his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been an eccentric and caring for character. A circumstance we learned, while our old friend at the cottage thought appropriate not to discoloso. He raised a very beautiful girl, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore sea, and he did wrong, bought him a piano-strong, and taught him so much to use it.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations everything on the rack, guessing who this logger in Greece or him. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eocentricities that mark the popular genius. Arrived in Palermo, gripped our doubles were dissipated. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\" about that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we have been a few years of shame; but \"Enfant Haralde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been curious about the research over the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of resuming to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I do this spreading, believing that he riots completely urinlerest, and in court in the good name of his secretary, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, inverse to the association of the human literature, or contributing in any way to soften its sentences, or to add to its plaidsuros. The fact is directly upside down, af can only be galhered from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of finor of the heart, so elegantly doped in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seat in bis bossom. Trend, sympathy, and charity appear to guide all his actions; and bis courting rest of solitude is cln son of roa extra to mark him as a being on whose heart ReIigion put his sea, and our head Benevolence threw his coat. No man can read the above pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. Respecting his rents or pleasures, I don't suppose a trubbt gives an opirian. The reprimands must be received with caution, in particular the wheri directed against the iritegrity moral of man; and the one who dares justjfy himself uses that the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a follow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is the worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testirnony of a virtuous heart on-Approve consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crawn-color, Fleel-Street.",
    "20": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very crazy in the East. Among the Arabs, he appears to be a common bc: he did not extend, hawever, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; the client did not assume his present form sinco, the division of Latin and Greek churches; to which timo, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, he gradually indecisived himself, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still extinct, of the dead rising from their graves, clrid feeding on the blood of the beautiful young clnd. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout all Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the cxisted belief, that vampyres nightimbibod a certain portion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly djed of consvmptions; while these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veins became dissolves to such a stote of repulsion, to cause the blood of passages of the irbodief, and even of the pores themselves of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is curious, and, of course, crediblo accounts for a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. He appears that with the exception of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the island, they positively and unwaveringly affirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, Namod Arnold Paul, had heard that, in Cassovja, on the borders of the Turkish Seruia, he had been tarnished by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and rub himself with his blood. This proposition, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy, for about twenty or thirty days after death and burial, money persoris complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of reading by bis attacks. In order to avoid sowing evil, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in the casos of uampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to a personalized remedy. A stake was completely divisive of Arnold Paul's heart and body, which is said to have shouted so terribly as if he had been olive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. Sarnetic measures were adopted with the course of people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they would become agents in their time over others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, beats a person chased by a vampire, becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nMoristrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of observations prefers than any other infestation that might occur. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a fort of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed in existence, that the deceased is not only made for sacrifice, but lamented to limit his infested visits only to those beings he washed the most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— An aluded supposition in the \"Giaour\".\nAs Vampyre sent him to the earth, then shall thy corsus be cut off from his tomb: then haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all the seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, by midnight draineth the stream of life: yet hate the banquet that knocketh shall feed thy living lovable corsus, thy victims, which still expire, shall know the devil for their sire: as ye cursed, ye slay them, thy flowers are wretched upon the grave. But he who for your sting must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Bénira, with the name of his father — This word will envelop your heart in flaming! But you must put an end to your tuft and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who made his blue lifeless; then the spirit of the hand without tearing tearing apart The treasures of his low hair, of which, in life, a lock when the offering of the tender affectionary was carried — But now is borrious far by Leo Memoriol of thy agony! But with your own blood, your snoring and your harging lip, and after your grave, Go-cland, with Gouls and Afrits rave, Tjll, these in Harror, are mixed with more cursed specter than they are.\nMr. Sotbey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy corsc of the good Arab Oneiza, who was reprimanded as having returned from the cave for the purpose of tormenting him, which she loved better during her existence. But it cannot be assumed that it was the result of the sinfulness of her life, that she was harassed throughout history as an complete type of purlty and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account of his journeys of surprising cases of vampyrism, to which one claims to have an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, has pulsed some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classical error, as well as barbaric bones.\nMany curious and interesting opinions on this singularly horrible superstition could be added; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple reinarking, that if the term Vampyre is the acceptance of an iri mast gene, there are other Sovereign synonymous with it, the madc use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThere are vampires.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the tone, more remarkable for his slngularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous caught his attention, so that he could by a black suffocate him, and throw foals into those breasts where reigned unconsciously ncs. Those who felt this serisation of apprehension did not explain from where he had risen: the same was true of the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, outside to the glanco to orie pierce through the interior works of the home; but fell on the check with a radius of lead weighed on the skin that he could not pass. The peculiarities of Hjs caused Bim to intoxicate every house; all desired to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of erecting their ottention. Despite the dead hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, whether it is modesty of modesty, or the emotion of passion, although her strength and contours are beautiful, many female hunters have tried to gain her attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they say of affection: Lady Mercer, who had been mockery of all the monsters she had been wearing in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put in the robe of a mountainbank, to attract her attention :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed to her, it seemed that they were reckless ;— even her unapplied imprudentness was flouted, and she had to avoid the field. But the adultery commori could not influence even the guidance of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him; but such was the caution with which he spoke to the virtuoso woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever speaking to himself to females. He had, howovor, the reputation of a winning tongue; and if it was even that he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hard device, he was often among those women who formed the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as many thaso who shoved him by their victims.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphari left with a single sieve in possession of the great wealth, by the parties that died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself also by the guards, who had their duty to sow the fortune, that they abandoned the greater charge of his mind at the core of merconary subalterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judgment. Ho had, therefore, this feeling of honor and condor high romantic, which every day ruins so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with the virtue with, and thought that the vice was launched in by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of seeing, os we pay in romances: he tang that that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and clever colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the virtues of life. Ho was beautiful, devious, and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the into gay circles, in any mother surrounded him, trying to describe the truth of the east, their languishing favourites: the girls clinged at the same time, by their fiery runnings which he approached, and by their glittering eyes, when he opened his lips, soori led him to false riots of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but from lack of snuffing, there was no furnace in real life for any of these congreries of folds and tough descriptions in the volumes of those, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was lowered to relunquish his dreams, which the extraordinary being that we have above described, passed him through in his career.\nHe observed it; and very irresistible to form an idea of the character of an entire husband absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs to his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence, implied by the evitanoo of their contact: cleaning his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to cxlavagant ideas, he quickly formed this object in the hera of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become acquainted with him, has paid him attention, and so far has had no opinion, which his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was on the journey. Desiring to obtain information about this character singer, who, until now, had only whipped his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the vice career in order to put themselves on an equal footing with the elderly, and not to allow them access as the sky has fallen, that scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of ploasantry or praise, according to the degree of competence shown in their conduct. They agreed: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthveri, was surprised to receive a bim proposal for jojn. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which by chance had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they passed the waters of the circle.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has made sure that, although many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results offer different conclusions of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle, the cloudbond, and the beggar, received from his hand make that was enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey did not try to point out that the job was not on the iurtuouf, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied him, which he had given his alarms ;— these were sons of the gate with sneezes barely removed; but when the profligatc came to ask for something, not to relieve his wills, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. It was ardently attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which, in general, extended to the behavior of the retreat of the virtuous needy. There was a message about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the Iowest and the most abject miscry. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centres of all the vices of fashion; he entered there the whole spirit of Faros table: he bet, and always played successfully, except where the best known was his aritagonist, then he lost even inority than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at the ciété around: it was not, however, that he encountered the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was set aside, arid his eyes sparked more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the mouse half-deciding. In every city, he lifts the youth formerly deafening, torn from the circle, he cursed, cursed, in the soljtude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him within lhe to reach his friend; while mony cl father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his immense wealth fire, where to buy even enough to satisfy their desire presentered. He did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder whom he had just pulled from the convulsivo catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of taming the attainment of the most experienced. Aubrey often wishes to represent him to his friend, and begs him to resuscitate this charity and pleasure which have proved the ruin of all, and which do not tend to his own prosit ;— but he dislodged him — because he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly at bim; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and almost the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye without voice as his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain great or gratification from her that the tough excitement of vainly wishing to breclk that mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the tedious appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey spent time losing sight of his companion; he left bim in daily attic on this morning circle of Italian Countess ari, while he went in search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, that he entered into impatience; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing affection but; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination of irito that there was a bad power resident in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on immediately crushing his friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had acquired, for enhanoc his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had to be cast out from the pinnacle of the urisulized virtue, down from the abyss of infamy and degradation: inflne, that every female, wbom, he had suggbt, apparently on the habituance of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed to you the deformation of the whale of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey dismayed leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which left the eye. He resolved to instil a perfect pre-let to abandon it completely, by seeking, in the medium while, to monitor it more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same article, slow soori perceived, his Lordsbip was finishing to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady whose whom he mainly frequented. Iri Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met with society; he was therefore obliged to keep his plans in secret; the eye of the Aubrey hut followed him in all his windings, and soon defamed that an assiduary had been designated, which would be the most likely erid in the ruin of a young girl, though invincible. Without losing his fire, he won't miss Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked the lady for her repulsive intentions, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his desire to meet her. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions of half were such that he assumed that all would have on such an occasion; and after being pressed that he intended to marry her, he laughed meroly. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that time, he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship on the night of the visit, he ordered a bis servant to look for other apartments, and called the japan to the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about his Lordship character. The assignation were...\nThat is right. Lord Ruthven the following day merely sent his fervent to notify her full consent to a septclration; but did not suggest only sus-\nThe point of his plans was thwarted by the Auhreys intersection.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed Peninfula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; arid soon occupied himself in the race for documents erased from ancient glory on inunumenls hot apparently, shame to chronicle the acts of freemon only before the slaves, had asked the members under the ground sheltering or mary colored material. Under the same roof as he, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that sbe could have formed the madel for a pointer wanting to pour on convls the prornised hope of the faithful in the paradise of Mohammed, except that his eyes spoke to a lot of spirit for any order to think that it could belong to those who had no Sauls. As it was deigning on the plain, or tripped along the side of the moon, one bathe thought lhe gazelle a poor type of his bounties; for whom he exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of naturo arimated, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light step of Ianthe often abated Avbrey in his search for swelling antiquities, and often we could be a non-corresponding girl, tight in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty to its shape, floating as it was on the wind, to the aigor look of him, who forgot the letters that he came from doyphcred on a nearly effaced tablet, in the pretemplement of his figure of sylpb-like. Osten would like his braids to fall, as if it were a matter of threading, to display in the ray of the sun such brilliantly shining shades that quickly fade, he migrates well, excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets his body escape the very object that he has a child before thinking of the vital importance of the good interpretation of a possession in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocent, youthful, and beautiful, without being affected by crowded rooms with arid drawers, striking balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep the memorial for his future hours, she snuck herself, and looked at the mogic effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of his place of origin; she then described at home the circular dance on the open plinth, painted to him in all the brilliant colors of the memory of the youth, the pomp of marriage that she remanifested while looking at her childhood; and then, turning to subjects who had emptied a greater impression on her mind, hlm recounted all the supreme tales of her nanny. Her apparent conviction of what she was telling exacerbated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as she said in the account of the living company, who had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to provide her life for the following months, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh out of such idlc and horrible puppets; but Ianthe quoted her the name of old men, who had at last deciphered one living among the lhemself, after many of their relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of the friend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, begged him to believe it, for he was evil b een, notes, that those who dared to question their existence, have always had a proof of givon, which has forced them, with the staggering pain, to confess that he was lure. She detailed the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror multiplied, by a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her breasts, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural pore of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to be more arid altach to Ianthe; his innocence, his contrast with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he did not seek for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while ridiculing the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying ari without duet Gre ek girl, he found himself still mare and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He would rip it out to Tyrncs from it, clnd, forming a plari for some antiquariari research, he would leave, determined not to return until his object was reached; bvt he always found it impossible to fix his contentiori on the ruiris around him, while in his mind being retclinated an image that seemed to be the only right time owner of his thoughts. Nathan was the dishonest of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. She seemed to have left the bin reluctantly, but there were difficulties because she no longer had one with whom she could screw her face-\nwhile his guard was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to my parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, the pale of horror in the name itself. Soon after, Aubrey decided to carry out one of the bus excursions, which was detairi for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, at the same time begged him not to return to the night, as it must necessarily pass through a word, where no Greek would ever remain, after the doy closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the mousse ailments as imminent on him who dared to cross the way to Jr. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to bring them out of the idea; but when he saw them mocking a superior, infernal power, whose very name had apparently frozen their blood, he silenced himself.\nNext morning, Aubrey went on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and urged him to come back, and the night took the power of these beings to be full of action ;— bo promised. He was so busy in his research that he did not perceive that the light of the day was about to end, and there was in the horizon one or those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly, got into a huge mass, and poured out all their fury on the devoted land .— He finally went up his head race, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: the butt was too late. The dusk, in these southerly climates, is almost urikriown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his echo tbunders had barely the air de real interval — its heavy rain forced its woy through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked lightning blue tube seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse took frigid, and was carried with a draconian speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found itself, by the glare of the lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly rose up from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he seized, hoping to find one to guide him to town, or at least trying to get a better coat of the storin. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman mingling with suffocation, exulting with a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— it had begun —\nbut, awakened by the thunder that aclin rolled on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced to open the door of the cabin. He found himself in the darkness of the author: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; although he collided, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He did not hear any more talking to anyone who immediately felt himself harassed by a force which seemed superhuman to him: he determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, and read; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on the bim, and knelt into his chest, had laid his hands on his rod ;— when the glass of many torches penetrated into the hole which gave rise to light ;— he rose up instantly, and threw his prey, and rushed through the door, and in an instant the crash of the branches, as he pierced the wood of the torches. The storm was still snow; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by the lhose without. They entered; the light of their torch fell on the mud, and the lhatch loaded on each individual straw with heavy footflakes. At Avbreys will, he lay down for the one who had drawn bimby shouts; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch once again upon him, to the airy shape of his beautiful conductor brought a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only an arrowing vision of bis disturbed the imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, extended by his side. There was a rio color upori his cheek, not even on the ber lip; but there was silence on his face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— for his men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was said next to her who had recently been to him the object of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was tainted with a bourbier and seemed to run away from reflection, and he took refuge in a shelter. He held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger from a particular builder, which had been found in the hut. They were quickly met by different parts that had been erected in search of her who had missed a mother. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, foretold the parents of some terrible catastrophes. \" To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the Corsican. They were incoriable, both died in the heart of the broker.\nAubrey being pulsed to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals, Lord Ruthven and Ianthe would be called upon – by a certain inexplicable umbiliation, he seemed to beg of his former companion to spare the being he loved. At the time, he permeated the maldiction on the head of the bis, and the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, ebabi to this time also arrives in Athens, and, for whatever reason, on the sign of the slate of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he resumed his delirium, he was horrified and starred at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by words, his kirid, imploring almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and climax that he showed, soon reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathy of being wba had so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to worsen, he began to interfere in the sarned state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet the bis gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of mafia exultation playing with his lips: he did not know why, but this smile hated him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of the lhose orbs, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to wish to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, through this shock, had a lot of fun, and this easiness of the mind, which had such a distinguished swallow, now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the vicinity of Atbens; if he did so in the midst of the vines, he used to frequent, anthes shape stood next to bis – if he plowed in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly, he turned, showing, to his wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He discouraged stealing scenes, all of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lard Ruthven, whom he himself held bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his stay, to visit these parts of Greece, which he had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and sought a place of excretion to which a memory could be attached; but, while they hadtened from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They barbed a lot of robbers, but they began to gradually these relationships, which they imagined to be only the vendion of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of those they defended against supposed dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On entering, however, a narrative defilement, whose bottom was the bed of a torrent, with large mousses of rock descended from the nearby precipices, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for scarcity they were the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bolts near their head, and by the echood ratio of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left Thomas, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to shoot in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, imitating the example, withdrew for a moment by lowering the bend sheltering defilement: but shameful to bend thus held by an enemy, who, insulting the shovels to move them forward, and being exposed to the slave without resistance, if one of the robbers should climb up and take them to the rear, they dlermined to 0 to rush forward in search of theeriemy. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey, who was listening to his help, no longer listened to the tale or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him, his guards having, on the road. Ruthven is wounded, aborted immediately and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon induced the cm to carry his overflowing friend into a nearby hut; and having agreed to a ransam, he was not more dislurbed by their presence — they being content meroli to keep the entrance lill, the comrade should come back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased rapidly; in two daily mortification rules, the death set in motion shook the advance with hasty steps. His arid conduct had not shaken himself; he seemed as unaware of the pain that he had been objects around him; but towards the end of the last craze, his mind became apparently unlucky, and his eye often fixed an Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help with more seriousness than usual –\" Help me! you can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of the friend Yaur. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do something earlier ,\" Aubrey replied. \"I am only a little lucky, my life flourishes, I carinot expiated in everything — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honovre was free of staln in the mouth of the world — and if my death was known for at the same time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He won't be drunk. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, exclaiming from exulting violenco ,\"Swear by, all your soul resents, with all your natural fears, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crying or death to any living misfortune, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ran down the pillow of Hjs, and 6 did not react anymore.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the married circumstances that were present at his knowledge with the man, this arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came to evoke him, as it is of the present of the horrific enchantment that awaited him. He got up early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole into which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed yesterday that it was no longer levrc, having transported by himself and coma, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, gaining access to a promise that they had given his seigneury, that he had to expose to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several bones, the men, determined to go and bury in the place where he was. Bull, while he was looking at the top, found no trace of the corpse or clots, although the thieves swore that they were pointing at the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally revolted, convinced that they had drunk the rope well in the name of the clothes.\nCl country lassary in which he had met with such terrible errors, and in which all apparently oonspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had grasped on his mind, to be resolved to leave it, arid soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhvon. Among other things, it was a case containing offences several weapons, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several cold ataphans. While turning them back, looking at their form of curious, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style called the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — basting to get the further proof, he faded the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapted, though a little shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular felm, the same variable shade on the shaft and the bedside were similar in splendor in both, and did not leave the room for the adult; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sinyrna, and on his way back to Rome, the first investigations were to record the lady whom he had tried to tear up seductive calls from Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune was ruined, and she had not been ardent since the departure of her lordship. Abrcy's mind became almost broken urider, so many horrors repeated; he was convinced that his lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He was morosely afraid, and his only occupant began to insist on the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the reading of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which obeyed his will, soon swept him over the English coasts; and he dwelt in the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to his sister in the fire, in the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile cares, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear to you, she was even more endearing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid applause of the salon assemblies. There were no bones but the light glow that exists only the heated atmosphere of the overcrowded apartment. His blue eye was never raised by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a certain feeling within, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not. a that light foot, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract — he was sedal and pensive. Alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his bream blew him his affection, and wanted in his present to forget the deed, she knew that he had destroyed his rest, who would have changed his millet to that of the voluptuary? It seems that if these eyes — this face played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, had not been taken to the witchcraft. He was thought by the other guardians swearing that his presentation should be delayed until his brother returned from the continent, when he could be his protector. So it was now resolved that the right lounge, which was approaching quickly, should be the pace of its entrance into the \"occupied scene\". Aubrey would have preferred the Romanod iri to be a manor of his father, and fod on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashionable foreigners, when his miride had been torn apart by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in London, and prepared for the next day, which had been arranged as a living room.\nThe offering was surplus — the living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to rest in the smile of the kingship hurried there. Aubrey was excited about her sister. That he stood in a corner by himself, devoid of al-I the avorta, engaged in the memory that the first ho ho saw Lord Ruthven was in the same room — he suddenly felt seized by the arm tob, arid o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" Ho had little courage to see a spectre the blast, when he perceived, at little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his almost limbs refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the sea, being himself the man in his age of rearing, the arid was taken to the house. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would explode with his broiri. Lord Ruthvon again before him — circumstances began in the dreadful picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe it was possible — death still fails !— He thought his imagination had controlled the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — which determined, therefore, to go back to society; for tangb he intended to ask to record Lord Ruthven, the name bung upon his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister, the assembly of a close relative. He left it under the premise of an inatran, retired to a recreation, and gave himself to his own devouring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were loving, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by many, appeared in a serious conversation; tried to pass and approach her, someone, whom he asked to move, turned to rust, and revealed to him these exploits that he did not know the most. He came and took his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, and made her suffer towards the street: at the door, he found himself blocked by a crowd of servarites waiting for their lords; arid while he was taking care of them, he heard again this voice whispering near him :«Remember your oath !”\nAubrey became almost destroyed. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely was absorbed just, now than the certainty of the life of the monster again pressed upon the high thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she took Hiin to explain to her what had happened with her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The snoring he thought, the more perplexed he was. The oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying the breath in the ruin, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his supplications, who would accommodate him? He was already mocking death, he recalled, the use he had made of his procession to bring the world out of such misery. For days, he remained in the state of this; locked in his room, he saw no one, and accepted only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, far from his sake, to support noir. Finally, no danger is able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his hut, roamod from the street to the street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for her famese, used the people to follow him; but they were soon distracted by him who fled from a pressure swister only any – from the truth. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to go back to society, and to look closely at HLM, anxious to forcwarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached privacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented eyes and eyes were so striking, bis inwardly shuddérirings so visible, that his sister had to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, the guardians, who proved to be unshakable, considered it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his melon would be alienated, believed that there was again a great confidence that had been imposed by Aubreys parents.\nHe had counted every day in his wanderings and prevented him from exposing to the general eye of the rnarks that they considered to be, they engaged the doctor to reside in the house, and the lake's constant lake. He hardly seemed to notice, so completely his mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence 6 is finally so great, that he was unsettled in his room. He often lied there for days, the abhorrent of being awakened. He became ill emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and collectivism left showed itself upside down to his sister's entrance; then he could sometimes have started, and, grabbing his hands, with grievously grieved appearances, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near her, if your life for me is beautiful, don't come near her !\" When, how do you?\nShe asked whom he referred, her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And again, he threw himself into a state, from which he could not even revive. This lasted for months anyway: however, little by little, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and the bis spirit threw a part of its morosity, while its guardians observed, that temps sévcraux in the day to counte upon his fingers a certain number, and their smile.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the top of the last day of the year, one of his guardians in his room began to converse with his doctor on the melancholy eircumstanoe of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was then going mainly to get married. Instantly, Aubrey attentiori was attracted; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with the return mark of the intellect, whose fear they feared that it had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Cell of Marsden. Thinking that he was a count with whom he got involved in society, Aubrey rejoiced, arid them even more astonished by his expression, bis inlention to be present on the nuptials, and deciding to see this sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the irisluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once alive to feelings of affectionori. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with so distinguished for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; the experimenting, what was his savour to see the characteristics of the man who had so long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, orrides the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, to be looked as if he did not understand it — then seizing his hands, and looking at a friatic expression of Countnanee, he told her to swear that she would never have watched this monster, for he — but he did not advance — it seemed that this voice again sad that he remembers his oath, that he suddenly turned around the Lord Ruthven and saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and physicists, who had heard everything, and who thought it was just a reminder of his trouble, inherited it, and abandoned it from Miss Aubrey, wanted to hate him. He fell on his knees towards them, begged, and instructed them to doloy the best for a day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, had taken possession of his spirit, tried to paeify him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthuen had called in the morning to swell the living room, and had been refused with all the lessons. When he bearded Aubreys ill health, he read that he understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he bequeathed that he was considered mad, his exullation and plea could hardly be concealed from those ainongs who had obtained this information. He went to the house of the former companion of his, and, by consternation, and the claim of great affection far from him, and interest in his destiny, he gradually worried the poor of Miss Aubrey. Who could wrestle his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the shaken earth, sowing her to whom he was addressing ;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, except that he could beistent to soften the accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, he won his affections. The total of the eldest branch falling long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as ari because to hasten tho marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was of the lake place the day before his departure for the conlineent.\nAubroy, when he left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, while she was stealing her happiness, her honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who sent her into their claws as the hope of their house and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this morning, on which he denounced the heavy curses rolls. His servants promised that they would deliver him; but by giving this to the doctor, bet you no longer harassing Miss Aubreys spirit through, what he considered, the greasing of a mariac. The night passed without rest to the busy inmatos of the house; and Aubrey heard, in mind, a more oasily horror than conceive than described, the nats of the occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Every climbed the most fantastic. The curiosity of the scruarits at least overcome their vigilance, they gradually run away, leaving him in the custody of an old ari woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a bovrid wcls over from the room, and in a moment I found a little in the apartment where all was almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the flirtation to perceive him: he immediately approved himself, and, taking his elm by sorc, the rassasia of the play, without a voice with the grace. On the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his lock. \" Remember your oath, and a girl, if not my wife, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to the servants, who, awake by the elder wife, had come into the sea of him. Aubrey could no longer stand, his rabies found the vent, breaking a blood vessel, and he was in bed. This was not mentioned in his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physician was afraid to help him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left Londori.\nAbbreys weaknesses increase; the outpouring of proverb symptoms from the blood of the near-death approach. He disinterested his sister guards and, when midnight had struck, he compositely recounted what the reader had perpetuated — he immediately died.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthven had disapproved, and Avbreys sister had got the test of VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER CONTAINING A RESIDENCE ACCOUNT OF LONE BYRON MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was in front of the film, where to choose his place of rest, and provide his gossip .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put in the port of Mityleric, on the island of the thal. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have thor, induces a lot of British vessels to visit it — the men of war and merchant; and although it is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums reimburse amply for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bay bolt, and while the men were employed in gallering, and the sor cottle merchant with the natives, the clergy and myself took a ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and the other places where we had a boeri before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that we had come from Scio WITHB a Lord Eng 1, who left the island four days before our arrival at this Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and could have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was curious, but a very good Indian. The cottage, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old inan in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred and two thorns for him ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his feluoca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis adcourit excited our uriasity very much, and we did not waste time welcoming our peasant to the home who had rested. We were well received by an old man who coriduced us over the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting lounge and a bedroom, with a large closet attached. They were all simply decorated: green walls of folds, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the centrcle, arid a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by the movement of a six-edin spring on the table side of a small bronze Venus in learing posture; a large sofa or complete sofa table furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane armchairs, and a library company: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The bedding had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow – the common bed across Greece. In the sitting room, we obsessed with a marble niche, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we didn't think we were just looking at the contents. On the reef tablet, drop Voltaire, Shakespeare, Bail-\nThe works of water, arid Rousseau are complete; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmermon, in German; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Last, an Italian odition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamplets of the Greek press in Constantinople, many tom, but from the English book of any dowry. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, while with a pencil, in Italian and Lotin. The Messiah was literally gribibbled everywhere, arid markod with paper briefs, on which were also marks.\nThe old man said :\"Tobe lord had read the books in the evening before he halled, and forgot to place them with others; but,\" he said ,\" They must go there until his return; for which is so special, that I have been making more things without order. He would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a service; and I had the farm of production for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechins which I paid to an elderly Arnenian who dwells in a house of sinall in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know the reason sour what .\"\nThe appearance of the outside house was pleasant. The portico in front of waf fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pilars in the marble canned with black plinths and carnices of cargo work ,( as it is now usual in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, topped by a light stone balvstrade, was covered with a carpet of turkey fino, beneath an awning of coarse linen strong. The roofs of the houses are thus furnished, as in the evening the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, the wines of the high dr, such as \"lachryma chr isti\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, when we entered the hut, a stream of smail glided, grapes, oranges and lime gathered together on its edges, and uridating the shadow of two bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on the which we were told, the lord passed many bones his day before.\nNirigs and night until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" praying, for he was very fervent, and he always maintained our church twice a little, except on Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be torpedoed \"a bird's fly view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olives and blueberries in bloom, and took the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it faded into the woods of the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and the air horizon colourless by a single eloud, finishes the view in savour; and a little on the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and peamtrees, several small islands were distinctively observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I liked a view more than what I did; but our riquiries were fruit, Jess on the name of the person who had resided in this romantic society: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could say it, but I sure he won ,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" I don't dare ,\" he said. We didn't have any time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned the several details of the isolated lord. He had a portion of eight young girls when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and arid silk of cotton to the girls who live wearing these items. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his property in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared loud, from all that we collected, for having been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage felt appropriate not to reveal. He had a daughter-in-law moft, with whom the Lord often walked on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a fort on the piano, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the inharmatiori with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations clinged to the rack, guessing who this creep at Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: to be a philanthropist of disposition, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who went wrong in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I visited him at Mitylene .\" We had never had the glory of the secretary at that time, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe HaroIde\" being put in our groups, we recognized Calclas reoluse in every pige. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curious in our search for courage, but we comfort our elected ones with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the future doy care; but to me that day will never return. I invent this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of its secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unconsidered provision, associated with humanity, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or strange to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed the points of the seigneury in half, seem to have their seat in the bis bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and thus courting the rest of loneliness is an additional reason to mark him as a being on whom Roligion Halh has put his seal, and on whose head Benevalence has cast his manna. No man can read the previous passing \"trails\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports must always be consulted with caution, especially when it comes to the morol interegrile of the man led; and the one who dares to justfy before this terrible trihunal before all have to appear, only can censor the crars of a sellow-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shuri the applause of the world, the surest testimony of a Christian and self-adhesive virtuosity.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Prince, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "21": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to 6th commonly didriol, Howeuer, extends to the Greeks according to established Christianity; he normally assumed his farm personal Sirioe the division of the Latin and Greek Churcbes; at that time, the idea of becoming predominant, trot a body of Latin could not corrupl if he put in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the suffering many wonderful stories, always cleaning, tombs of rising frornoirs, and feeding on the charge of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and L orraine, that there were belies, that vampyres rightly soaked a certain part of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consurntions; what these fattened human blaod suckers—on their veins became distended to such a state of replelion, to cause the flow of blood from the passages of all them from their body, and even from the poref even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March ,1732, is a curry, and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is blocked for having taken place in Madroyga, Hungary. It seems that on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they opposed, unanimously, thal, about five years before, an eortajn Heyduke, riamed Arnold Poul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, or the friars of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by cl vampyre, but had four years to rid himself of evil, eating part of the earth over the vamp-\nYour grave, and rub it with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people sympathized for having been roasted by the hjm, and a statement was made, that four persori had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid new disorders, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and have found (af is supposed to be usual in the case of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from eruption, and emitting it to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure blood and blood. Since Proos was thus obtained, they resorted to the queeny recovered. A stake was completely led through the heart and the body of Arnold Paul, where it is reported to have also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. They cut his head off, buried his badger, and threw the ashes of them into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the resources of those people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, should arrive on the others who survived the war.\nThe universal belief is that it is someone who was chased by a vam....\nPyrc becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked, as it seems preferable to illustrate the subject of presenter observations than anything else that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a hereditary crime committed waste in existence, that the deoased is not only condemned to homage, but compeiled to limit his infernal visitations so much to those he loves most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy son shall be torn from his sepulchre: then the place of origin shall be desolate, and the blood shall suck all thy seed: from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, toward the middle of the night shall drain the stromal of life: yet the banq uet that persecutes shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are fallen, and they shall exhale, and they shall know the devil for their sire: as thou cursedst, thou cursedst them, thy flowers shall be dried on the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best blind of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet you have finished your task and you have marked the washed tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the lasl glassy glanco must see which freezes his lifeless blue; then with a hand shail tear without Halloween Tbe braided yellow hair of beer, from whench, in life a lock when the tenderest commitment of Disorder has been worn — But now is carried away by the memorial of your agony! And thou shalt cast out the best drop of blood, and thy nibbling tooth, and thy harging lip; and thou shalt hunt the sulten tomb, and cause Gouls and Afrits to flow, until these horrors depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting him most loved during his existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resulted from the sin of her life, she being evacuating the whole circle as a type of purity and arnocity. The true Taurnefort gives a long account in its spans of several of the amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he is committed to having been ari eycwitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating his effects, put forth some learned dissertation, tending to prove that he is an elastic errar, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting nolices on its superstittion sirigularly horrible could be added; although the present can stand for the limits of a note, unjustly diverted to explanalion, orid, which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that if the train variant is that in most genes-\nAcceptance, there are several other synonyms used in various parts of the world: like Vrucolocha, Vardoulacha, Gaul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the most of the dissipations on winter London, the various parties of the leaders of the ton appeared a noble, remarkable moro for its singularities, that its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted only its attraction, which was damaging by a glance, calming it, and which it feared in the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could explain from where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance, pierce through the inner works of the heart; a bull fell on the cheek of an ieaden ray that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to each house; also wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt the burden of being angry, were happy to have something in their prefecture capable of engaging their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its outlaws are beautiful, many women tried to gain her attention after fame, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they were the night of the infection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster sewn in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself away, and did everything but put on the dress on a mountain bank, to attract her attention :— but in vain :— that she was standing at the top of him, the eyes were apparently fixed on her, she still saw as if they were not understood ;— even her unapplied impudence was stooped, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidance of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent. This is what he said to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, but a few people knew he was speaking to him. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; whether or not it was a language that he even surpassed.\nEven the fear of its singular character, or that they were moved by apparent hatred of the voice, it was also often among those women who formed the boast of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who jostled it by their voices.\nAbout the same thing, a young man named Arthur arrived in London: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by priests who died while he was in adolescence. Left also to him, if by guard-joy, who has him, he gave himself the duty to look after his fortune, as they abandoned the import of his mind to look after sbaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this feeling of honor and high romantic frankness, which every day there were so many apprentices. He all believed in fympathizing with virtue, and thought that voice was thrown into by Prouence simply for the pictorial effect of the sceno, os nous sec iri romancef: He thought that the misery of the cottage consisted only in the calving of the clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various coloured patches. However, in the end, the poets' dreams were the realities of life. Ho was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, at his entry into gay circles, many mothers surrounded hirn, trying to describe the least truth, their lariguishing or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by lejr glittering his eyes, when opened his Ilps, soon led him to false noticians of his talents and merit. Attached to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starred at the finding, that, except in the tall and fullckered wax candles, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of these congerles of pleasant images and controlled descriptions in these volurns, of which he had formed his studies. However, finding a certain complement in his gratified vanity, he was about to return to his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we have above disordered, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and he was very impossibly able to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed ln himself, who glorifies a few other signs of his blotting out of external objects, then his consent to their existence, implicitly by the avoldance of their contact: giving his imagination to imagine every thing who flattered his propensity to exlavagant ideas, he soon formed this object in the hero 0s o romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather the persori hefore. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced to his opinions, his presence has always been recognized. Ho gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, arid quickly found, from the noles of preparation in — Street, that he was on the journey. Desiring to obtain information about his singular character, which, until now, had only blurred his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to tour, which for the Inune generations was thought not to allow the young to quickly swing in the care of the vice to scatter on an equality with aged tbo, and not allowing them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever intrigues scanned are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or of practice, accrediting your degree of competence that there is to wear them. They consented; and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Rutbven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem he feared, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, who willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubreyhad has not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and riow he found that, although much more of his actions have been compared to his point of view, the results of different conclusions in the reasons apparent to his conduct. His pronunciation was abundant in its liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from the hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubroy could not help making remarks, it was not on the virtuous, reduced to the indagoncc by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were sent out of the wildly sneezed door; bul when the profligate came to afk something, nat to relieve himself, but to allow him to revalue in his lust, or to plunge him further into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich cabarity. However, he attrigued him to the greater importance of wickedness, which generally prevails over the abuses at the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance of the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: al. I thase on which it was granted, inviolably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the lower tip and the abject foam misery. In Brussels and other cities passing through which lhey, Aubrey was surprised at the parenteagerness which his companion sought for the centres of all fashionable vices; there he entered the whole story of the Faro table: he bet-\ned, and always played with success, except where the best known was his anlagonist, and he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the immutable scale face, with which he generally looked at the society around: it was not, however, when he resisted the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a great smallly; tuna bis very wish seemed the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with a golden fire that trotted to the cat while deliring with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left the youth formerly flooded, torn from the circle to the head, cvsing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the spell had drowned him in the reach of this friend; while many sather sot fritic, in the midst of the looks talking of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive lc g rasp bone the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which, however, was not able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his frerridy, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved Olll rujn, and did not tend to his own profit ;—bul he delayed—worried every day that his friend would give bim an opportunity to speak frankly and only to him; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his marriage, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye eclipsed less than his lip; in ardour, although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gralification than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this rymyst, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of a certain supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, slow Aubrey for a long time lost sight of his companion; he mounted him every day on the morning entourage of an Italian country, while he went to search for the memorials of another deserted city almost. White was thus engaged, letters came from Srom England, he opened with impatience; the first was his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were from his guardians. The latter surprised him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was a reasonable power level in his companian, they seemed to give him enough reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately seized his treats, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, for the passion of the irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had been discouraged, his contempt for the adults had not been generated by the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to rehabilitate his gratiticotiori, that his victim, the partner of his guill, should be precipitated from the piiririacle of the unsuspected iurtuum, to the lowest abyss af insamy and degradation: in the end, that all the thase females whom he had fought, apparently on the council of their virtuco, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask of lc set aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformity of the uces to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on loaving one, the house character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent an enslaved pretext to abandon him completely, to purpose, in a way, to look at him more closely, and not to make small circumstances possess by vignotic. He entered the into the same circle, and soon perceived, as his Lordship was swallowed to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of which he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, he is rarely that cln female inrnorried is inet with in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's cye follows him in clall his flints, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent, though unthinkable girl. With no time lost, he entered the apartment with Lord Ruthven, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of fame that he knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthveri objected that his intentions were such that he assumed everything would have been such an opportunity; arid after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Auhrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from then on, he must refuse to accompany Lordship in the rest of their tour proposed, which ordered his servant to look for other pieces, arid calling to the mother of the lady, informed him of all that he knew, not only the gaze of beer daughler, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assault was avoided. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his sorusor to notify him of the complete separation; but did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of drawing the sad documents of the old glory on monuments which, apparently, shameful to tell the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored material. Uridating the same roof as himself, existed being, of beautifulsul cland delicate, he could have sowed the model for a painter wanting to pour on eanvass the promised hope of the paradise of the faithful Mohammed iri, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that it could belong to those who had no souls. As it would have been on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; sar who has exchanged his eye, apparently the animated eye of naluro, for this luxurious look sleeping on the ariimal subject but to the tasle bone an epic. Ianthes lighl stage often accompanied Aubrey iri search for antiquities, arid often would be an incorruptible girl, engaged in the pursuit of a K ashmerc butterfly, showing the beauty which of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the eager eye of him, who forgot the letters he had Jusl deciphered on an almosl erasing tablet, in the oontemplation of the figure of ber sylphus. Often, her falling braids, as she flattered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly fadiriges, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, wbo let escape from his mind the object even that he had before thinking of the importance vital for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms, feel everything, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, without being affected by overburdened drawing balls. While he was drawing remains of those which he used to make a memorial for his future hours, she looked, and looked at the magical effects of bis pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then describe at hlm the circular dance on the open plain, painted, taking into account all the bright colors of the yaulbful memory, the wedding point remembered having seen in his infamy; then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural talos of his nurse. Her wealth and her apprehension of what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; arid oflen told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her sweets, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful fairyle to prolong her existence for the following months, her blood would be ruri cold, while he landed to laugh at such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe quoted her the names of the old men, who had finally elected one living among us, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the appetite of the friend; and found him so unshakable that she begged him. Let us believe it, for it had been pointed out that those who had dared to question the existence of the Jr, still hodsome proos Giveri, which forced them, pain and sorrow tearing apart, to confess that it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of self-monsters, and her horror was amplifying, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Rutbven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could not be truth in his fears, though at the time of the renown, then he wondered about many coincidences that which had all tended to excite the belief in the supernctural power type of Lard Ruthven.\nAubrey begged one to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted by the values of the women he had sought for the vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of skilled English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he sounded more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself from the times clinging to her, and, forming a plan for an anliquary resurgence, he left, decided not to return until his object was attached; but he still found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins against him, while in his mind he retained the ari image which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. The anthe was unconscious of his love, and was always a childish scene being that he had known for the first time. She has always seen her separation from home with reluctance; but it is because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some which fragrance had yet escaped the band of destructive detimc. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present coveral, confirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the dwarf itself. After Souan, Aubrey dissuaded from continuing his excursions, which was to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him at once not to re-read at night, as he must necessarily pass through a word, where the Greek rio would never be renrani, after the day has closed, on any consideration. They described it as the computer station in their nocturnal origins, and denoun-\nCed the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared the cross their path. Aubrey made the light of their rehearsals, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw how he shuddered at his audacity so that he mocked a superior, infernal power, whose narne even made their frozen blood appear, he was silent.\nThen the morning Aubrey went on his excursion without being appalled; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and he was worried that his words, mocking the belief of his horrible fools, would swallow them with such a terror. When Bo was to leave, Charlie came to the side of his horse, and begged him with the utmost firmness to return, the night passed allowed him to put into action the power of these beings ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the sky would faint, and that on the horizon there was one of these flies, in the warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring all their rage on the devoted country .— He finally, However, riding his horse, dissuaded from catching up with speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm was above — his thunder ochoing had scarcoly a resting intorval — his thick heavy rain forced his way through the covered tho foliage, while they have fourked lighting seemed to fall and radiate at his own feet. Suddenly his horde got scared, and it was carried with the terrible speed to fill up the critted forest. The animal finally stopped because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighbour of a hole that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that overcame it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the city, or at least relying on the shelter upon the arrival of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear horrific shouts of a woman who mingled with him stifled, mocked an exultarist laugh, continued in an almost irritated sound ;— he was scattered; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. It sounded in deep darkness: it was he who guided it. He was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds c announced, and no notice was taken from the bim. He immediately seized someone whom he seized with a voice that cried out ,\"Again bafsled!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he himself afflicted from selling his first so dear, he fought; but he was in valen; he was lifted up with his feet and threw himself with enormous force against the ground: his one threw himself, and knelt on his chest, and put his hands on his throat badly; when the glarc of many torches penetrated into the hole that gave rise, he troubled him; he rose up instantly, and leaving his prey pierced the door, and at the same time the crash of the branches, as he broke the wood of Tobe, was no longer heard. The storm was now at a standstill; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered; the light of their torches fell upon the valleys of mud, and the thatched charged on each individual straw with heavy soot flakes. Aubrey's decision was searched by her who had attracted him to his cribs; he was again Iefl in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches on the brighter vpon hirn, to perceive the aerial vorme of his beautiful conductor brought a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that there was only one question that arose at the origin of the imagination; but he saw once again that he was lying on his side, when he locked them in. There was not colover at the top of his cheek, not an oven on his lip; but there was a silence about his face which seemed almost as attached as the side one of them lived there :— on his neck and breasl was blood, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A compyrus! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid beside her, who had been much the object of so brilliant and fairy visitors Mary, now falleri with the defect of life that was dead in her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed, and he had fun thinking, and to take refuge in the holiday, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by various parties that had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe their sorrows that could be impossible; but when they ascensaged the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirium; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent cambrianation, he began to beg his former companion to encircle the being that he loved. He then permeated the evil men on his head, and cursed him by cutting off his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, chaccd to this shot to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, upon heclring of the state of Aubrey, immediately plotd himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered from the delirium bis, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image he now had cambered with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rulhvcn, by his kind words, involving almost repentance far from the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attrition, anxiety, and care which he showed, soon restored him to the presence. His lordship seemed quite changed; he no longer seemed apathetic who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as bis convalesconce began to bc rapid, he became gracefully traced back to the state of fame of mirid, and Aubrey perceived rio difference of the old inan, except that time he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed lently on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but his smile haunted him. During the final stage of the restoration of the id inval, Lord Steven took care to look at the waves infallibly agitated by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, still still ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys mind, by the shock of this, was much weakened, and the elasticity of the which mind had once so distinguished it now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was a little more lonely and arid silence than Lord Ruthven; but as he wanted to mueh for solitude, the spirit could not find in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins of Tbe which he had once frequented, the shape of Ianlhe stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his step left seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest purple Tbe; then su deny touring around, would show your wild irony, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined the scenes of the fly, all of which created such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the tender heart which he had taken from him during the years '1', that they should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They went in all directions, and searched for all the places to which a memory was attached; but, while they rushed from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to blur these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of the individuals, whose interest was in the generosity of those they defended against the so-called dangers. This is the result of such a neglect of the inhabitants' counsel, on a occasion when they traveled with a few guards, a bit to serve as guides rather than as defence. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with the rock lorges brought dawri from the neighboring precipices, they had reasons to repeat neglect Jr; for hardly were the quire of the parly rigified in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echoed ratio of several gvris. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had a mangouri to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthvon on Auhrey, imitating the example of her, withdrew for a moment behind the shocking turri de tobe filthy: but shameful to be held by an enemy, who, with cries of jnsult, told them to progress, and to be exposed to slaughter without resisting, if one of the thieves should climb up and take them back, they decided both to rush forward in search of theeriemy. HardIy had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received the shot cl in the shoulder, which brought him on the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, na langer cheering the contest or his own principal, was surprised by seeing the faces of the bandits ouou and he—his guards live long, on the fact that Lord Rulbven was wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nWith promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; arid having agreed to a ransom, he no longer cared about their presence — perhaps simply being able to keep the entrance until the comrado sboreed again with the promised sum, far from having an order r. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly diminished; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct on appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious and pain of which had been objects about bim: bul to towards the end of the last evening, his mind became very uriasy, arid his eyes after sixed on Aubrey, who was prompted to offer his help more than usual sincerity —\"Help me! You save me, you can do more than that. I do not mean my life. I have struck the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you can save my horror, the horror of your friend. \"-\" How? Tell me how? I would do any thing ,\" said Aubrey .—\"I need, but a little, of my Japanese voices, I can explain the whole, but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and if the iny death was unknown for some time in England —I—I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. e :\"Sigh !\" Cried the dying man, rising with exullating violinens ,\"Throwing by all your soul revered, by all fear of your nature, swears that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to arrive alive in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or what you can see. \" His eyes seemed deaf from their bases ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He ran down and laughed at his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but he did not sleep; many circumfunces attending his acquaintance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shower came upon him, as part of the presentation of something horrific awaiting him. At the beginning of the morning, it was lowered to enter the hovel in whooh that he had left thorcorpfe, when a razor met him, and irifarmé hlm that he was no longer there, having been transported by bimself and comrades, upon his withdrawal, to the pinnaele of a nearby mountain, according to a promise. They had given her secretary, so that she might be exposed to the first ray of the moon tob that rose after her death. Avbroy was astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury in the place where he was. But, when he had gone up to the summit, he found no trace of either the eorpse or the clothes, although the thieves swore that they pointed the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a time, his fury was puzzled in conjectures, but he finally remained convinced that they had buried the corpse for the clothes' pants.\nThe army of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently aspired to this superstitious melancholy which had seized his mind, he resolved to leave him, soon stopped at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transmit it to Otrarito, or to Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had had on Lord Ruthuen. Among other things, there was a case containing several weavings of offer, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alagharis. While returning, and exarning their meritorious forms, what was a fury to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — took possession of an additional proof, to be found the weapon, and his horror could be imagined when he discovered that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held his harid. His eyes were not lacking in certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger, but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were concretizing the lady had tried to seize words. Ruthing is attractive. Her parents were in the distros, their fortune ruined, and she had not been very heavy since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had lost a victim to the destrayer from Ianthe. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of iri during the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lives of some once he held dear. Arrived in Calais, a breeze, overwhelmed obeying his will, soon watched hiin on the English coast; and he hastened to the manor of his father, and there, for a moment, seems to lose, in the clutches and classes of his sister, any memory of the past. If she before, by her infernitine ears, had won her afsection, and that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the torn drawing assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never raised by the levitation below the mind. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to emerge from the misforland, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indlcate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not that light soot, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by a smile of joy; but when her brother blew her affection, and forgot in her presence, the hashish sorrows she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the heart of the victory? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only cighteen, and had not been brought to the world, it was necessary for her guardians to have thought that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now, therefore, resolved that the next drawroom, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would rather stay in his father's house, and paumed melancholy that over-\nHe propelled it. He could not see interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when the spirit bis held beon so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into town, and prepared for the next day, which was announced as a drawing parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, attaching all those who were coats of arms to rest in the smile of royalty, haftenod thith-\n- Yes. Aubrey was there with his sister. While standing was in a corner by himself, devoid of everything around him, engaged in the total memory, the first time he had fen Lard Rvthven was in that same place, he suddenly felt seized by them orm, and o voice he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your cloth .\" He had the hard courage to turn, fearing to see a specter haunting him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure who had caught his opinion at that place up from his first entry into society. He looked until his mounts almost refused to carry their weight, he began to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, which threw himself into a carriage, and was taken to the house. He made the room walk with shouting steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthveri again before him – circumstances arise in a picture of dreadsul – the dagger – his oath. – He shaved his back, he could not believe it possible – death rises again!! e :– He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was therefore impossible to return to society, because although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthvon, the name having on his lips, and he was able to riot to obtain information. He went a few years later with his sister. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retreated into a corner, tied over, gave himself up to his devotees' rafters. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by devious, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when someone, whom he was asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he was most abhorrent. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, forced her towards the street tho: at the door, hesound hiinfelf prevented 6th tobe crowd of servarits waiting for their lords; and while he was engaged in passing the tbern, he again heard that voice murmured near him —\"Remember your oath !\"\n\"He dared not to turn around, but, in a hurry to his sister, he soon arrived home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explore your beer that had caused her brutal conduct. He only has a few words, afraid of those terrified hours. The more he flew, the more perplexed he was. Could he then allow this monster to wander, carry a ruin on his breath, one in the midst of being held dear, and not have his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if we were to break his oath, arid discuss his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would encroach his hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his way, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, chastised him, for his own good, to support the future. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stiffness and loneliness, he left his house, rammed from street to street, anxious to steal this image which haunted him. Her dress slipped and wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun at the humidity of the middle. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he put him to rest wherever fatigue avoided him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people who followed the thing; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend the arnongst, including the presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter clgain only fociety, and whip him ously, anxious to predict, despite the oath of hjs, all that Lord Ruthven attached to spiritual intimacy. Bul, when he entered a room, his hagnar and suspicious gazes were so striking, but inward trembling so visible, that his sisler was ultimately obliged to beg him to refrain from weakening, please, a society that affected him so strongly. When, hesitantly, the demonstration turned out to be ubiquitous, the guards began to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought that it was high to regain that confidence which was previously imposed upon them by the parties of Aubrey.\nDespered to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the age of genesis 1, the marks of what was considered madness, they engaged a doctor to reside in the hospital, and constantly cared for him. He hardly seems to notice, so complete his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His intelligence became the last so green that he was blinking at his room. He often lied there for days, disabling to get angry. He had become emaciated, his cyes had reached a vitreous first ;— the only sign of the reinaining affection and re-olleotion appeared on his sister's entrance; then he would some days begin, and, grabbing his hands, with lashes that seriously afflicted him, he wanted his riot for the touch. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, how, she asked whom he was speaking to, her answer was :\"Truly !\" And again, he fell into a state, which could even wake him up. It lasted a lot of months: little by little, However, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and the spirit threw the opportunity of his morosity, while his guards observed that several times on the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, and then smiled.\nThe evil almost ended, when, on the last day of the year, one of her guardians entering her room, began to discuss with her doctor about the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such a situation, when her sister went the next day to 6 th class. Aubrey's attention was immediately stirred; he anxiously asked whom. Happy to see the mark of the return of the intellect, which they had seized, the Count of Marsden was interested in him. Thinking that he was a young Count whom he had met in the focus, Aubrey rejoiced, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister accompanied him. It was apparently soothed again to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into her chest, arid kissed her cheek, wet with you ears, weakening himself to the thought of her brothel being more alive to the smells of affectionate. He began to speak with all his won warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and every accommodation; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his pin; open it, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his lift. He drunk the portrait in a rage of paroxysm, and brought him under his feet. She relied on him for the reason why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, who looked as if he were rioting uriderstand her—Tben seizing the hordes hands, and observing her with a frenetic expression of cavntenanee, he told her to swear that she would never have been able to marry this man, for he—but he could not move forward — it seemed that the thal clgain bale bim voice remembered his oath—he suddenly turned around d, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but did not see any one. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought this was only a return to his disorder, entered, said Miss Aubreys forcing, wanted to leave him. He attacked his brothers. He implored, he directed them to get rid of them, but for one day. They, attaching this to the madness they imagined, had misled possession of his spirit, were striving to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother after Tobes salon, and had been truffled with every class. When he heard of Avbreys evil, he easily understood himself to be the cause of history; but he learned that he was considered an irisane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those wrongs who had guilded the information. He hastened to the bosom of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the great emotional pretension for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained the row of Mifs Avbrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and tails that he was telling—could speak of burial, as he had known, his existence had begun to seem worthy of preservation, except that he could be bound to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to attack the escape of the serpent, or that was the purpose of destiny, that he would gain its effects. The title of the branch of the el der falling from the length to bim, hc oblain an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of its brother's disturbedstate ,) which was to take place the same day before his departure for the continent TB.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and the guards of his, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was him given; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjures her, as she values her own happiness, her own honor, and honor of those who are now in the grave, who once welded her in their arms as their hope and hope of their dung, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced our heaviest mo. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but giving him to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with an error which can be more easily designed than described, notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. The Aubrey grew up almost francial. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, they gradually scattered, leaving him in the custody of an old woman without vigilance. How seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, arid in a moment, was in the apartment where all were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice or voice. On the stairs, Lord Rut...\n\" Remember your oath, and know that, except today, your sister is dishonored. Women are careful !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rabies, unable to find ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, set in motion, he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left Loridon.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; bloodshed has caused symptoms of almost imminent death. He was doing his sister's tutors might be called, and when midnight had struck, he reported in a composite way that the reader persisted — he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey;\nGood, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and the guide of Providence .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek Archipelago, aboard one of the ships of his Majesly, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain plentiful eclttle and vegetables still have to have there. I did many British ships to visit — the men of war and the merchants; and although it is rather full of the way for the ships linked to Sinyrna, its bodies fully reimbursed for the deviation of a voiogy. We landed, like usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcri was used in watering, and the barging handbag for cattle with the natives, the clergy. and I took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and other rooms, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so nclmed) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he was a bad comic of Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days prior to our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken a lot with him; but I did not choose to leave Mltylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The culture on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, arid to left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six Zochines humiliated for her ,( about L 250 English currenoy ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis story has aroused a lot of curiosity, and we do not have time to hurry to go where our compatriot had resisted. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious clot attached. They were simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, set on a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed spring in the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room was a half English down, eane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had a large mattress spread out the floor, with two shrouded cotton quilts and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the chained word, we observed a marble recosis. Once, the old man had told us, bent on books and papers, which were then in the best of a great seamari in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contents. On the tablat of recreation, the works of Voltaire, Shclkspeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmorman, in the language of Gerrnan; the Messiah of Klopstock; the naves of Kotzebue; the play of the Robbers of Schiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the Svcral pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, mvcb lorn, but no English books of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a penile, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally soribbled all over, and in darkness with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old Inan said :\"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special that if I move a thing without or orders, he would frown on me for a week; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I throw to an agonized Armenian who resides in the small house in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the house from the outside pleaded. The portioo in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the unstoppable pillars canned with black and freight-work corriices plinths ,( as it is now usual in the Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone baluftrade, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awning of coarse, strong linen. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma christle\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hand of lef when we entered the house, a small streamlel glissa, grapes, oranges and smelts were oIstering together on his hordes, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marle seat with ari ornamental wooden back was placed, or which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights up to twelve clocks, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed because he was fervent, that he had always given birth to our church twice a week, in addition to the Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with myrtle in the flowers of 0 living feet, and on the top of which an annoid Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins collapsed into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea like glass, and a horjzori not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of lafty hazelnut and palm-trees, several small islands have distinctly observed, spraying light blue spots wave with emerald green. I liked a narrow view that I did; but our requests were fruitful on the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" Could he twist, but I'm not sure ,\" he said ,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I care ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We do not have the time of visiting the Arinenian, but when we returned to the river, we learned several peculiarities of the isolated gold. He had shared eight young girls when he was a class on the island, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses, lo others, and cotton and sick to the girls who live by doing these articles. He also bathed a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he attracted us, from what we had gathered, for being a very eccentric and diligent character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old brother at the cottage, considered appropriate not to decipher. He had one of the most beautiful gods, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea, and he had brought him a piano-forto, and taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information we left from the peaceful island of Mitylerie; our imaginations all on the clock, guessing who this creeping in Greece could be. How hard money it was evident: he had the disposition of philanthropy, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our customs were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect Tobe, a student of WYATTLES, who had 6th in travelling to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\" about that you are so anxious, is Lard Byrori; I have a mcl on my trip to Tenedos Island, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had then heard the fame of his ship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla iri every page. We deeply regretted not having been moro curiaus in our research at the cottage, but we consolidated with the idol of returning to Mitylerie on a future day; but for me on that day, you have to go back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good ram of his secretary, which was grossly sla indeed. It has been described as an endless dictation, contrary to association with human nature, or controlling in any way to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleas. The fact is really the rovers, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, see their place in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and opacity seem to guide all his actions: his courteousness at the rest of loneliness is an additional reason to mark him as a being on which religion sealed his heart, and on which the hoax Beneuolence threw his coat. No man can read the previous \"traits\" of losing without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleas are concerned, I do not assume that there is an opinion. Relationships must always be reissued with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byrori's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous, original, and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Fleet-Street.",
    "22": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this place is found is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, he seems to be oommon: he rioted, however, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he surely assumed his present agricultural sinoe the division of the Latin and Greck churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, he graduated, and formed the subj ect of many wonderful storks, still existing, of the dead rising from ruber graus, and feeding on the blood of young and handsome babe. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the existing belief, on the night of the vampires, soaked up some of the time of the victims, who became emacia, lost their strength.\n, and, specdily, died of consumption; while these fattened human blood suckers – and their veins distended to a state of repletion, as with close blood tube to flow from all passages of their body, and even pores even from the lower skin.\nIn the Londori Journal of March 1732, is o curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of compyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that following an examination of the commarrider-in-ehief and the magistrates of the place, they declared positively and inanimately, that, regarding the previous years of life, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been hard to say, that, ot Cassovia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating part of the earth of the tomb of the clumber, cland rubbing liquor with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many perfons complained of being tormented by him, and a statement made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other mishaps, the jhabitarits having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free corruption of srom, and emit to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence had thus been obtalized, they resorted to the cure of accusation. A stake was pushed completely through Arnold Paul's heart-opened body, when he would have cried over ostensibly as if he had been alive. It was done, they cut off the head of the bis, burned his body, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of the clothes who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become the agerites of others who survived them.\nThe uniusal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyro becomes a hammer himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is recounted here, because it seems better suited to the subject as the observations predestined than any other instance that could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is possible, as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed during the existence of life, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to those beings whom he has praised the most on earth — those to whom he was raised by a bond of kinship and affection. — A supposition allowed in the «Giaour».\nEven first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall be torn from her sepulchre: then haunt the place of gladness, and suck the blood of all thy seed; from thence thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stredema of life; yet hate the baricate that persecutes Musl shall feed thy living corsus, and thy victims shall perish, and they shall know lhedemon to lbeir sire. As you curse yourself, you curse them, your flowers are wilted on the stem. But whoever sows your crime must sow, be honest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This service will engulf your heart in flames! Yet, the Musl puts an end to your task and marks the last spark of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glazed look must liven up that freezes his lifeloss blue; then, with the unhalifted hand will tear the braids of his yellowish, of which, in the lock of life when the thorn Disturbations more pawny walls carried — But now is supported by the memorial of the time agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth, and thy harging lip; and groaning toward the tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror beg the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Suthoy also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalabo\", the vampyre cross of the Arabianmaid Oneizo, which is represented as having returned from the grave in order to torment it she better avedwhilst in existence. But it is not due to the fullness of her life that she began throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The voracious Tournefort makes a long account in his travels of several aftonizing cases of vampyism, to say that he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, pull releases some dissertations learned, trying to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the presentmay suffice for these limits a riot, necessarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms, makes use of in the small parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, VardouCacha, Govl, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt has happened that in the most bones dissipations attend a Lo ndon winler, it appeared to the different parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the high of the mirror, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attributed his intention, that he chewed by a jeook suffocating him, and cast fear into the breasts where the gypsies reigned. Those who sealed this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: somo attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring at the face of the object abbe, did not seem to penetrate, and at one look to pierce through the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on the check with the lead ray which weighed on the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be irritated at every house; also wanted to see him, and those who had the bacon accused of violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to do something in their presence capable of engaging their bitterness. Despite the deadly hue of her face, while driver gained a warm hue, either from the bluffh of modesty, or snoring the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, many female hunters after noloriety tried to win her attitudes, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters sown iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw herself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her opinion :— but in vain :— when she stood before hlm, although her eyes were evident six on her, it seemed that they were decorated ;— even her non-oppal impudence was flouted, and she left the field. But although the common audience had no influence even on the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sox was indifferent to him; but it was the apparent thing with which one spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, some knew that he never addressed women. He has, however, the reputation of a winning language; and that it is that he has even overcome the dread of his Siriguar character, or that they have been moved by his apparent bathed in vice, he was also often among those femas who form the vanity of their sex of their dome virtues, like among those who push her by vices lher.\nAt about the time came, there was a carn in London, a young gentleman of the name Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by guardian, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more important burden of his mind to the care of the subalterris meroenaires, he cultivated more imagination than his judgment. He had, therefore, this romantic high feeling of honor and candor, which ruin dajly so many apprifices of milliners. He believed all to sympathism with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: hc thought that the misery of a cottage simply consisted in the bouquet of clothes, which were also warm, but that we adapted better to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colorful palches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the rites of life. He was hondsome, frowning and rich: bitter these reasons, on his irito of training gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least through their languishing or grotesque favourites: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating countnancos when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon took him into the madness notjons of talent and his merit. Attached to the romance of solitary hours, he was surprised at finding that, except in the tallow and wax almonds which darted, not from the presence of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in the life of recall for any of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. By finding, however, a compensation in his graceful vanity, he was eager to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through it in the best career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea like the character of a man entirely absorbed in itself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: owing his imagination of eulogy image something that flattered him propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his ancestor, rather than the heforhim person. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and advanced much his note, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were shaken, and soon failed, with notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain some information regarding the singular character, which, now, had only wet his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to execute the whole, which for many generations has been thought necessary to allow young people to wash a few quick steps in the caroeur of the vice to put an end to an equality with the old people, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the sufferest of pleasantness or praise, eclipsing the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They agreed: and Aubrey immediately mentioned his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to come back from behind a proposal to join him. Tired by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in a com rim with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions patterns apparent to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, recidivated with hard help more than enough to relieve immediate desires. But Aubrey could not avoid point out, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied the venpon virtue, that he lowered his awns ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he waf returned with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed to him the greatest imporlunity of the viculous, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtue.\nOh, my God. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse upon it, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sank to the lowest and the most atrocious misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Avbrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought out the centres of all voice in fashion; he erupted in al 1 tbe splrit from the table of faro: he spoke, and always played successfully, except where the best known wos his antagonisl, and then he lost even rnore that he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which to be gradually looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the young eruptionfl riovice, or the chanceless father of a great family; then his very desire seemed fortuitous, this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes were astonished with more fire than the cat who was throwing himself with the mouse half dead. In every city, who left the young flock, torn from the circle, he adorned, enraging, in the solitude of cl donjon, the fate that attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat frclntie, in the midst of the airs talking of silent hunger children, without a single distant from his last immense wealth, where the purchase even sufficient to satisfy the hour present desire. But he did not take any money from the tab of the game; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last dorlot has just been ripped off from the corivellsive catch of the innocent: this might but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the trick of the most experimented. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his brother.\nand begs him to give up the charity and pleasure that proved to be ruined by all, and did not tend to possess — but he delayed it — every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this neuer happened. The Lord Ru, in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich landscapes of nature, always remembers it: his eye spoke less than the lip of hjs; and though Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of him than the constant extreme of finally wanting to hreclk thal myslery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of some superriatural.\nThey soon stopped in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left the home in the daily presence in the morning circle of a countries of Italy, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted eternity. The first was from his sister, breathing only effects; the others were cursing guards, the latter blinded him; if he had before entered his imagination into that there was a bad power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him a sufficient reason for belief. His guards immediately insisted that he left his friend, and exhorted that the character himself was terribly serious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his skilled licencants more dangerous to society. It had been defamed that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the chemistry of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to respond to his gratification, thal bif uictim, partno of his guilt, had to be precipitated from the pinacle of unsmoked virlue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that the women whom he had sought, apparently on an account of their virtue, hod, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not burned to expose the defornity of their vicos to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single straight point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, posing, in the mean while, to look closely more, and not to let the light circumstances pass without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the examination of the lady's daughter, whose house he was mainly frangling. In Ilaly, it is rarely that a urimariated seme is encountered in socioty; so it was impermissible to pursue its inseparable plans; but Aubreys eyo followed him in all his windings, and soon dissociated that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end up ruining an incorruptive girl, though insensitive. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked her for her internions with the lady gaze, informing her at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions were such that he thought that everything would have had on an occasion; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry beer, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from the moment he had to declare accompanying his Lordship in the rest of their proposed tour, he ordered his safetyman to look for other parents, and lingering on the mother of the lady, inform him of all that he knows, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The passage was presented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to warn Hls complete Assenl to a scaffolding; bvt did not suggest any suspensiori of his parents having messed up his Aubreys iriterposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directly took his steps towards Greece, and crossing Penirisula, soon found himself in Alhens. Hc then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to draw up the records erased from the ancient glory upon monuments which, apparently, shameful to narrate the acts of free men only before slaves, had biddon themselves blessed the ground housing or a lion caloured lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter who was fighting to throw himself on Ibe canvases promised the hope of the period of the faithful iri Mohammed, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. As she was dancing in the plain, or tripped clinging to the mountain side, a type of bank would have been bought from the gazelle; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the adapted animal but to the taste of an epic. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, shows all the beautiful ber shape, floating as he was on the wind, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he had just deciphered on an olfactory tablet, in contemplation of his sylphous figure. Often, her tresef would fall, as she flattered around, would expose in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escape this mind well the object that he had thought strongly of of vital importance to the veritable lenterpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms, but none appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing remains of which he wanted to preserve cl memorial for his future hourf, she stood, and was worth the magic effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then describe to hjm the circolating dance on the open plain, wuid bread, to him in all the flamboyant colors of young inemoratory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered to see in her childhood; and then, tuming to subjects who had obviously chewed a greater impression on her mind, would tell him in all the superriatural tales of her nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she tells, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told the story of the living vampy, which held passed years among his friends, and tricks of fraud, forced the year of dawn, feeding on the life of a beautiful snoop love. In his distant existence, the rising moriths, his blood ran oold, while he tried to laugh at him out of these idle and horrible scandals; bvt Ianthe clinged to hi in the names of old McN, who had finally detected one living among them. After several of their relatives and their children were found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the fien; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged to believe it, for he was noticed, that those who dared that their existence, always had a given proof, which forced them, with pain and inflamed heart, it was true taconfess. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that the truth could not be a truth in her fears. At the same time, he wondered about many events that all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens natural pixel power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his iriocence, so contrasted by all the virtues affected by women among what he had sought for his Romanco vision, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a urieducated Greek girl, he still found glarelf more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form before him. He sometimes ripped the inside of the hcr, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he went off, warning not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to flirt with his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept on the denage that seemed to be the sole possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was still the same infertile franc being that he had known for the first time. She always sketched out to separate herself from him with reluctance; but just was because she no longer had an ari with which she could visit her favorite haunts, while the herguardian was busy sketching or unraveling some fragments who still had escoped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed the existence of the Jr, pale with the very horror of the drama. Shortly afterwards, Avbrey decided to make one of his excursions, which he detairi for a few hours; when they barbed the name of the place, they all at once hegged of hiin not to return at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after that day has closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the inost hoavy bad as imminent on the one who dared to cross the road. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but we saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way a superior, infernal power, the same narne of which apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the holy melancholy of his host, and was concerned that his words, Moekiring the belief of horrific fools, had inspired them from such a terror. When he was to leave, Ianthe came next to his horse, and set himself aside from HLM to take refuge, and he allowed the power of these dreams to be aclion. However, he was so busy with his research, that he rioted that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, quickly got into a huge mass, and poured all their rage over the devoted country .— He finally, However, riding his horse, determined to compensate for the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and it was already advanced, the power of the stone was above — it echoes thunders had a horrific pause of rest — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the glass, whipping the forked lightning seems to sneak and radiate its own feet. Suddenly his horse to work fear, and be carried with a dreadful speed through this tangled beforel. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the gate of lightning, that it was in the neighbourhood of a hovel that hardly rose up the masses of dead leaves and broadwood which encircled. Demonstrating, he seized, hoping to find some once to guide him to the city, or at least trust to get a shelter against the storm. As he learned, the thunders, for a while in a net, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mocked with the suffocation and exultation of a laugh, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced upon the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. Hc was apparently not perceived; for, he called, always the coritivized sounds, and no advice was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone whom he immediately seized; if a voice cried out :\" Again gagged !\" to whom a great laugh took hold; and he himself felt struck by the one whose status quo seemed superhumari: determined to fall his life as hard as he was, he struggled; but it was in vain: he rose up from his party and threw with a turbulent force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on himself, and krieelingupon bis breast, had laid his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torcbes penetrating into the hole that gave light into the day, destroyed him ;— he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and a moment tecrashing of the branches, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. The story was still there, and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon taken by those who were without. They swollen, and the light dropped their torches on the mud walls, and the thatched heavy soft straws on each straw. At Aubreys desire, she was sought, who had drawn him to his cry; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, which the light of the torches came upon him more brightly, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductors brought into a corsus without life. He yelled at his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he closed them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a black face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on the neck and chest was blood. d, and upon his throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid beside his wife had been late for him, the object of so many bright and magical visions, now fallen with the flower life that had died the witch. He did not know what his thugs were: his mind was believed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in vaance—which almost unconsciously held in his hand, a bare dagger in a particular correction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon sent by different parties who had been engaged in the fear of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the family, announced the parents of some catastrophe dreadsul. \"Let it be impossible to describe their flesh; but when they made fun of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the cross .\" The theory was inconsolable; both died broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most uiolenl fever, and was often delicious; in these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by a uriaccountable combination he seemed to be begging for his former spa companion to be loved. At other times, he inprecaced maledicin on the head of his, and cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, blessed at that time to arrive at Athons, and, from what clever motive, up an audition of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and hemlocked his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whom he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, imploring almost repentance for the madness, He had caused their separation, and always remorse by attention, anxiety, and care he had wasted, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed to change from quite; it no longer appeared that the apathetic wbo had so stunned Aubrey; but as soon as the conualescence began to be rapid, he became bound up gradually in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio differential brake the dead man, excepling that at certain times one was surprised by meot bis staring at him, with a sinile exultation playing on the lips bis: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the re-enactment of the rivalid, Lord Ruthven was at ease to shake the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning around, like our world, the inveterate sun ;— In fact, he operated your desire to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe mind of Aubroy, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of the spirit that had once so distracting it now seemed to have sledge forever. He is now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wished for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sighed him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequented, the form of Iarithe stood by – if he was looking for him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for purple domestic tobe; then southward-\nTurning round, he would show, to his wild pronunciation, his pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to fly scenarios, each characteristic of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his disease, to go to these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, arid looked for all places to which a memory could be attached: but though they hadtened so from one place to another, but it seemed to riot your attention on what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but gradually they began these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of this neglect of the inhabitants, they traveled one day with a few guards, more to serve as guides than a defence e. By entering, however, the inconsiderate defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, where large inosses of scrambled rocks from the precipices nearby, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for it was the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, on the basis of the echo of several cannons. In a moment, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example, withdrew for an injection behind the sheltering turn of defilement: bul shame of boing thus held by an enemy, who with irisulting shouts to do them harm, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if the clny robbers should climb above arid take them into the reor, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They were not safe from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey fell down to his assault; the avil, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was so surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having wrongly been wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately thrown into their arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon encouraged them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and, having a ransom, he no longer differed by their presence; they were content only to keep the entrance until their comrade victim laughed at the promised sum, for he held an order. Lord Rutbven strérigth declined rapidly; in two days, inortificationened, and death seemed to progress with the steps of hostia. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like a piri conconclous as he had been objects of obedience: but towards the end of the last evening, his urid became apparently uncomfortable, and hls cye often fixed on Aubrey, who was forced to offer his help with more than the usual sergonsf —\"Assist me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I do not mean my life. I have listened to the fact of existence iny as little as that of the past day; but you can save the iny honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey replied .—\" I would do anything. But if you hide from me everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and my death was unknown during a dark period in England, I have a habit of life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Jure !\" cried the dying man, hatsing himself with exulting violence ,\"Swear by all your soul dreams, by all the nature of fears, swear that for a year and one day you will not communicate your knowledge of the crimes only or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or the whale that you can see. \"His eyes shuddered in their sackcloths ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not go to sleep; the married circumstances attaching his acquaintance to this man rose his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came to see him, as if from the presentation of some horrific wait bim. Early rising the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met hiin, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to hislordship, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Abbrecy astonished, and taking several of the men, dissuaded from going and burying him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of neither the corpse nor the clothes, although the two robbers wore the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his urid was shaken by conjectures, but he, in Lasl, returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the land in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to sigh this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been one case of corruption of several weapons of crime, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. These were fairy daggers and aghans. While turning them around, and looking at the curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ommented in the same style as the red shredded dagger in the fatal hut — trembling hc — eager to get more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he was sitting, you might particularly fashioned, the shock he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same varying shades on the shaft and the seat were similar in splendor in both, and left no room for doubt; there were drops of also blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigator was concerning the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthvon. His parks were in distress, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his secretary. Abrcy's mind became almost restrained under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this hod lady would fall victim to the destroyer at the earth. He became morose arid silent; and his only oonsisted profession exhorting the speed of postilions, as if he were going to save the life of an original he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon ballotta bim at the shores of the English; and he welcomed in the home of his father, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and cars of his sister, all the memory of the post. If before, by her child care, child gained its effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey has not won the total grace that wins the gaze and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no such light shine as exists only in the hedged atmosphere of a rolled apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy oharm about her which did not seem to be born of malfortunc, but of some expenses inside, that appcared to indicate a consciaus soul of a more brilliant kingdom. His sleep wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could alternate – it was sedate and precise. When alone, her face was never broken by joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and fought in her prefecture to forget those dreadful who she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not had the impression of being born, because her guardians thought that her presentaliori should be delayed until her brother returned from the Conti-\nNent, when he could protect her. It was therefore now, solved that the next drawing-rooin, which was rapidly approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his house above his magnifiers, and fed melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolous of fashionable strangers, that his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had witnessed; but he decided to sacrifice fice bis his own comfort to his sister protected Jon. They soon arrived in the city, and the real day was prepared, which had announced 6 th as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held so long, and all those who were anxious about your bask in the kingship's smile were hastening thilhor. Aubrey was there with her sister's baby. While he was sneaking into a corner by himself, caring all around him, engaged in the memory that the time when he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice he rebuked loo well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your wall. \"He had a terrible courage to turn, full of a spectre that would blow him up, when he perceived, in a distance liltle, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place at the first entrance of bis into society. He looked up to 1 shift members almost back to their weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw him in his car, and was taken to the house. He clung to the room with anxious steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began vp in a ignoble picture — the dagger — bis cloth. — He awakened him even, he could not help him possible — the dead ascent again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that he could be called — he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; although he tried to ask for the cancer of Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not pursue it by obtaining information. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he withdrew into a corner, and there he gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awakened, and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by sevoral, apparently in an orange conversation; he tried to pass the training approach her, when one, who was asked to move around, turned around, and revealed to him these products that he was most abhorrent. And he went forward, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hasty step, shut up to the street: The door which he found himself obstructed by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; being attached to passing them, he heard again that the voice murmured near him –\"Remember your oath !\" – He dared not to turn, but, in a hurry from his sister, soon approached his home.\nThe Aurey became almost dislocated. So much so that his mind had been attached by the once subject, bowing much more completely was absorbed, now that the certainty of the monster's disease has pushed on his thoughts. Her sister expectations were now uriheeded, and it was in the opinion that she intimidated her to explain the whale to her that she had caused her conduct set in motion. He spoke only a few words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised HLM ;— was he ready to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid the Jews' progress? Maybe his sister was torn by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought Os was using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, was already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to support the future. Finally, he is no longer opable from the calm of bearing and spirit, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, anxious of a flytbal image that haunted him. His drugs became negative, and he wandered, as if they were exposed at noon --\n- the sun of the day like the midnight damps. He was not ten years old to be rebuked; he returned first with the evening to rest; but in Laslhe he rested where he was surprised by fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, worked for the people to follow the bim; but they were soon removed by the one who fled from a rapid pressure than any — from the thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Hit the idea that he left by his abscene all his friends, with a challenge among them, whose prefence they were uriconscious, he decided to enter again into sooity, and watch closely, anxlous lo forewarn, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached intimity. But when he entered a room, his harassed and suspicious eyes were so moving, his Irish chills so easily, that his sister was at last ambiguous in begging him as an abstari to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. Whenri, commenter, the demonstration proved to be inavailable, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that our parents had before encroaching on them.\nDespering to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered every day in his wanderings, he clinged to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, on the lake constitut care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, if his mind completely was absorbed by an earth subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There would often be time for days, a terrible 6 years awake. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— there was only the sign of sluggishness and recollection of the memory displayed at the top of his sister's entrance; then he could have started something, and, grabbing his hands, with glances that were grieving him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch back — if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, commenter, be irquired to whom he refers, his only answer was :\"True! True !\" And again, he sank in a state, from which she could not even roam home. These lost many months: little by little, bowler, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became more frequent, and his mind threw a portion of his morosity, which his guardians observed, that several times in the day he could count on his fingers a definitive laugh, and then smile.\nOn the last day of the Ycar, once of Hisguardians entering his room, began to converse with the doctor bis on the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey iri so terribly siluation, when his sister was going to get married the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he shook with anxiety to whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, of which they feared that it had been devoured, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and still amazed them by expressing his intention to be present to the nationals, and eager to see his sister. They didn't shake, but by sewing for a few minutes, his sister waf with him. It was apparently again suited to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to the chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother, the more alive onco look to the sentiments of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth welled, and to congratulate her on his marriage with such a distinguished four rank and achievement very; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; opening it, the whale was his surprise to see the characteristics of the two monsters have long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of the rock, and the pietina under his feet. After asking him why he thus dishonored the relationship of his future husband, he looked at him as he did not understand him — then grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frantic break-in of conscience, he said he sweared that she would never have married that monster, because being — but he could not advance — it seemed that this voice had asked him to be a member of his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but had no one. In the moanings, the guards and physicists, who had heard the whole, and thought that it was only a return to his trouble, entered, and forced Miss Aubrey, wanted it to crush him the hell. He fell on his knees for them, implored, begged them to the delay, but one day. They, attributing this to the imagined that madness, had taken possession of his mind, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the living room in the morning and refused all the others. When he was aware of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood to be the cause; but when he suggested that he was considered crazy, his exultation and plea could hardly be deduced from those among whom he had obtained this information. He bathed at the house of his old, arid appearance, by the attrition of constancy, and the pretext of a great break-in for the together and interest in his destiny, he wrote the ear of Misf Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell — could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being in the crowd, except with the one to whom he addressed ;— could say to the bow, since he knew her, her existence, seemed worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of ferpent, or such was the will of fclle, that he gained his affections. To the title of the elder branch falling long to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed impasse of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servarils, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the grove, who once held her in arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, or that he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that just bet so as not to harass any other Miss Aubreys spirit by, what considered, the gratings of a nanniac. And Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than described, riots of busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the wedding broke his ear. Aubrey cultivates a fraritic almost. The curiosity of the servants finally surprised the vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving in the custody of an old woman on duty. He was pretending the opportunity, with the bound order, was out of the room, and in a moment it was in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approved himself, and, taking his arm with strength, rushed him out of the room, without ardour. When the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured Iris ear –\"Take up your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, your sisler is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his spears, which, shaved by the old woman, were in search of the hive. Aubrey could no longer support himself; his rage had not found a tent, had a hrokeri vessel of blood, and it was transmitted toed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bride groom left London.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; the swelling of symptoms of near death has been caused by blood. He wanted his sister guardians to be called, and the hour of midnight to have struck, to take back with the complacency that the reader perpetuated, that he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord R, then had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, he had to choose his romantic place, and Providence his guide .\"\nIn 1812, we placed in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have there, lead many ships Britain to visit him — both men of war of the arid merchants; and though jl is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrno, his premiums pay amply for the difference of a voyage. We landed, as a visual, at the bottom of the bay of Tbe, and the men were used to water, and the sacrillary man trading sor cattle with the navels, the clergy, and myself caught a ramble at the calied cave, Homer School, and other places where we had been before. Ori the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and engaged a Greek yung like our guide, who told us that he had come to Scio with a Lord English, who left the island four days before our arrival in his festival. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said to Greck ,\" and would have taken me with the hive; but I didn't choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a curious, but a very good girl. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left a businessman in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six zechinos grouped for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about five months, but not constantly; for he sails in his face very often towards the various islands .\"\nWe wasted time taking possession of a house where our compatriot lived. We were greeted by an old man, who cannoned us over the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a living room, a bedroom, a large fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green wailles, marble tablahies on each side, a myrtle of lclrge in the center, and a small faunt below, which could be played lo through the branches by moving a spring filled in the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large coueh or sofa completed the fumiture. In the room stood a half-dozen chairs of Cane Ériglatre, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bed chain had only one big malt....\nread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the lounge, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's shop in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileav and Rousfeclu are finished on the tablet of recreation; the ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in the Germari language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parina in 1810; the little pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinirople, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with notes of margol, written with pencil, in Italian and Latiri. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to trap them with the theories; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for he is so particular, that if I moved the thing of the old without order, he would sling on me for a week westward; he is very good otherwise. I did him a service, and I had the production of this farm to have trouble dealing with it, except twenty zehines that I paid to an oge Armenian who resides in a small contract in voodoo, and I don't know for whom the reason .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The price in front was long and wide, arid the marble pil flanked.\nThe cornices (as is now the case in Greek architecture) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surmounted by a huge roof of a high stone, was covered by a fine cherry carpet, under an awning of a lincn clear strong. Most roofs are so furnished, for them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating frult, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nIn the hand of the left as we would engulf the bouse, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lime agglomerated on his hordes, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was plated, on that we were told, the lord spent many of his ovens and nights until 1 twelve hours, sneezing, scrig, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose,\" said the old inan ,\"playing\" for him was very devoted ,\" and always atlined our Twiee church week, besides Sundays.\"\nThe point of view snored this spot, which could be called a bird victim .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mourit Calcala, in the middle of blueberries of flowering olive trees, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruiris sank into broken waterfalls, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon vnshadowed by a single clovd, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of noble hazelnuts and plumtrees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue spots wave with green emercled. I rarely appreciated the sight more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this Romaristic society: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armerian,\" said our educator ,\"but I sure he won\" he said ,\"my old friend, and you can say it,\" he said ,\" If I can,\" he said ,\" I wouldn't dare .\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and everyone was dancing with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to an Indian, horses to others, arid cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also built a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to be a very eccentric and benevolent character of all that we had gathered. Once the circumstance that we have learned, that the old over friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lard was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a pianoforte, and had taught him about it himself.\nThese were the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing about this rambler in Greece, could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and he had these eccentricities that mark the peculiar genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts came to the light. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the archilect, a WYATTIC pilot, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual,\" he said ,\" about that you are so anxious, if Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tericdos, and I visited him in Milylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of the secretary, as we were a few years from home badly; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. We deeply regret the riot of having been more euriaus in your searches at the cottage, but we pushed bearelvef with the disc of returning to Mitylene or some suture day; but to me that day will never return. I make this slate completely uninteresting, and in court to the good narrate of its security, which has been grossly slandered. He has been described....\nan inappropriate disposition, an association with human nature, or any contribution to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered in these small anecdotes. All the most beautiful enemies of the heart, so elegantly represented the poems of his secretary, the section to have their seat in his bosom. Terepidity, sympathy and charity seem to give to all his acts; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a belief in which the happy religion sealed, and over whose head Volunteer has cast his coat. Na man can reorient the previous pleasant \"traits\".\nI feel proud of myself as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasure is concerned, I take the right to give an opinion. The reprimands must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a terrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and to reject the applause of the world, is to be the most clever of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Street, Fleet-Street.",
    "23": "A VAMPYRE:\nA little.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Amang the Arabians it seems to be common: he made the riot, however, extends to the Greeks until clfter the establishment of Christianity; and he only took his presbyterian form from the division of Latin and Greek churches; to which time, the idea which prevails, that a Latin body could riot corrupt so buried in their territory, he incrusted gradually, and formed the subject of the wonderful stories, still existing, of the existence of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the 6 moon of young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyref soaked at night a certain portion of the blood of their victims, who emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of convmptions; wbilst these fattened human blood suckers — and their uines hecame distend to such a state of replolion, in order to cause the blood of salt to flow through their blood, and even pores from their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732 is a curious, and, of course, credible account of a parliculor case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madrcyga, in Hungary. He applied, thal on an examination of the cornermander-in-chief and the magistrates of the plao, they asserted with positivity and without arduousness, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnoid Paul, had been heard to say, thal, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented hy a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating part of the land over from the tomb of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not precede it from becoming a vampire hiinself; for about twenty or thirty days after the death and burial of bif, many person corn complained of having been tormented by it, and a deposition was made, four people were deprived of life by hif touching. For prevent further mischiof, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found (as it supposed to be usual in cases of uampyrism) fresb, and entirely free of corrugation, and emitting clt the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the proof was thus obtained, they resorted to the usedromedy. A stack was quite led through the hort and Arnold Paul's body, where he is expelled for screening as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of these Persians who had died before of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived the lhem.\nThe universal belief is that a person fucked by a vampire becomes a vampire shines off, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis rodomantade monstrouf is bound, because it seems more appropriate to illustrate the subject matter of these observations than any other which instance could be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a cl tri of punitivemenl after dealing with a heinous crime committed while he was in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrlse, but forced to limit his unfortunate visits only the being he loved inost while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of k indred and affliction .— A supposition alluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, Vampyresent bones, Your oorse will be torn off his tomb; then the gha haunted native placo, Arid hunts the blood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, woman, about midnight drain the wind of life; and yet hate the banquet that perforce must feed your living Corsican ljvid, Your victims, have come to expire, They will tear the mori for the sire; As you curse, you clothe them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem of Tbe. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best loved of all, shall bless thee with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last spark of his eye, and the last sight of glassy muscles that freezes his lifeless blue; then with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when shom Asfaction, the most dear pledge was worn — But now if you are carried by the Memorial of your agony! And the best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth and thy haughty Iip; and thou shalt hunt the tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Asrjzraue, until they depart from a spectre tighter than they.\nMr. Soulhey also introduced in his beautiful wild bulb power of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having retumbd of the tomb for the goal of the lormonter bim that she loved better during her existence. But one cannot assume that this results in a sin of life, that it spreads throughout the whole talk as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veraciaus Toumefort gives a long account in his travels of several cases of astonishment of vampyrism os, for which he claims to have been on eyewitness; and Ccllmet, in his great work on this subject, bcside a variety of anecdotes, and traditionclry narrrives illustrate its effects, put kind sound learning dissertations, tending to prove that he is a classical, as well as barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible smoking could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by mercly remarks, if the Vampyrc term is that in the most general acceptance, it ores several other synonyms with it, unadulterated use of in various parts of the world: like Vrucolocho, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nHe has struck that in the most dissipations accompanying a London winter, lerc appeared in the various we partic from the loads of the ton a riobleman, more remarkable for its singularities, than his rank. He looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention, which he could by a glance stifle left, and throw the into fear these reins where the carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not explain where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance, pierced through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had become accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence that could attract the attention of our attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either by the buffoon of modesty, or by strong passion, although her furnace and her elline are beautiful, many female hunters, after her notoriety, tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, dark marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw herself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a montebank, to attract her attention:— though in vain :— that she had put herself in front of him, that she apparently had eyes fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were not understood ;— even her unapplied imprudence was squabbled, on her left field. But although the common adulter could not insult even the guidance of his eyes, it was riot that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent warning with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he never addressed herself to your female. He had, however, the reputation of a grinning language; and whatever it was true. He even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were shaken by his apparent beat of vice, he was also often female among those who formed the best of their sex from their domestic virtues, as among those who shoved him by their vicos.\nAbout the same time, he arrived in London, a young gentleman from Aubrey to dwarf: to be a left orphan with a sister only in the possession of a great Beltb, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. He left Alsa to his guards, who thought it was their responsibility to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the subalternants ccrenary bones, he cultivated more his imagination into judgmonl. He had, therefore, attended a high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruined so many learnings of millriers. He believed everything to sympathize with the whole virtue, and so much so that this vice was thrown into by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the view, as we see in romance: He thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the making of clothes, which were like warin, but that we better adapted to the paint eyes by their irregular folds and the different color stains. He thought, in fact, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was beautiful, fiery and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surprised him, trying to describe the truth, leost their languishing or crawling favourites: the girls at the same time, by their dazzling country when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon loosed him in false notions of his stories and his merits bis. Attached as he was to the romanque des heures solitaires bis, it was astounded to find that, except in the fallow and wax almonds which darted, not from the resence of a ghost, but from warit snuffling, there was no basis in the life of reol for any of these congreries of pimples and descripions pieasing c0 held in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. By finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was obsessed with requiriquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have defcribed, met him in his ore.\nHe looked at him, and the improbable to form an idea of the character by a man completely absorbed iri bimself, who gave little olfactory signs of his obsequence of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing each thing to pouture each thing that flattered propensity the extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in the hero of a romance, one determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He acquired himself with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced to his police, that his presentation was always recognized. He gradually realized that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were embarrassed, and soon sounded, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining sumptuous information about this singular character, which, until death, had only curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tower, which, for generations, has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a quick step forward in the civil career in order to put themselves in line with the elderly, and rioting allowing them to appear as fallen from the skief, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They agreed: and Avbrey immediately evoking his inflections to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to withdraw from him a proposal to join HLM. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, be accepted by him, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he found that, although much more actions of hls have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions of the olive optor to his conduct. His passion was profuse in his first freedom ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the virtuous vpon accompaniment furnace, that he was given alms ;— these were sent to the door with sneezes barely removed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to move in his lvst, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was an orie circumstance about the character of his Lordship, which was fatill more impressed on his mental thase on which it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, because they were all led to the sea, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other lowrifs which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent challenge with that his companion sought for the centers of Oll fashion vice; he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: ho bet, and always played with successf, except where the knowri was the antagonist hjs, and there he lost even more than he won; but he always wilh the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he ran the young novice rasb, or broke him without chance of a great family; then his law of scined fortune very desirable-this apparent abstraction was put aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the eot wbilst Dalying with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the former rich young man, who had been born from the ho adomé circle, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate had drawn him to the reach of this fjerid; while many fathers sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes talking of hungry children, without a single spell of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. However, do not take money from the table of play; bvt unanimously lost, to the winegrower of the rnany, the last guilder that he had just removed from the unique catch of the innocent: this could but bc the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the hanger of the most experienced. Aubrey Osten wanted to resign himself to his friend, and to bring him back to the charity and pleasure that proved the ruin of all, and did not make his great profit ;— but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his treat would give him a certain trick to speak frankly and operily to him; however, this never took place d. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of him various wilds and rich scenques of dwarfhood, was always fame: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was neclir the object of his curiosity, heobtajna grandor gratification of him that the constant excitement of wanting to break the mystery hell, while his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; he left him in daily attendance in the morning cleavage of an Italian country, while he went in search of the mummorials of another almost deserted city. To the extent that he was so engaged, letters came from England, to the extent that he opened himself with impatience; the first came from the sister bis, breathing nothing from the atonement; the others shook from her guardians, slowing him astonished; if he had entered into his imagination that there was a referent of power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belly. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, arid vrged that his character was terribly vicious, because the transmission of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; bull which he had demanded, in order to erect his gralification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be precipitated from the pinnacle of careless virtuo, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in fine, typing all the women whom he had suggbt, apparently because of their value, bad, since his departure, even threw the mask set aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of the vices heirs to publicgaze.\nAubrey determined on the leaving one, which the character had not shown that a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He decided to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purfying, in the meclin while, to look at bim more closely, and also did not let pass light circumstanchccs without attention. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady who the chlefly house frequented. In Italy, it is sold that an unmarried female is encountered in the société; which was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but the cye of Aubroy salted bim in all its windings, and soon discouvons red that a clssigna lion had been appointed, which would end the most evil in the ruin of an innocent, lough girl without thought. Losing does not have time, he cracked Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked him for his interests with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Steven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would happen on such an occasion; and on the beginning insisted on whether he intended to marry him, only laughed. Auhrey retired; and immediately, writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and invited him to the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not as regards the Hor Girl, but also as regards the character of the Lordship. The award was avoided. Lord Ruthvon the following day sent more and more servants to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not mind any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by the interposilation of Aubrey.\nAfter seeing Rorne, Aubrey went to Greece and crossed the peninsula, the season ended up in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon oceupie himself in the race glorified recartes were destroyed on manufacturings which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the slaues, hid under the sheltering ground or many colored llchen. Under the same roof as him, oxistics being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the sor o painting model wanting to pour on canvas to promise the hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of the mind for someone to think that she could beloring at those who had no souls. As she was deigning on the plain, or tripped along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who would have bathed his eye, apparently the eye of the animated riature, for this luxurious look sleeping from the suitable annal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Iarithe Osten accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, arid often would be anodized girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere hutterfly, numbing all her beauty of her form, sloaliring as she was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who had forgotten the milk which he had just decrypted on a nearly breathless tablet, contemplating his figure of sylph. Often, his falling braids, as the side wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun suck delicately bright and suffocating the hues, he might well excuse the oblivion of the aritiquarian, who let spit out of his mind the very object that he had before tangbt of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Paufan-\nThat is right. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, for no one can hang on ?— It was innovation, youth and beauty, without being affected by suffocating arid drawing rooms. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial during the hours of failure, she stood up, and watched the magical effects of her pencil, intracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe to hjm the eircling dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the bright color of the youthful memory, the mordious pump that she remembered to look at in her irony; arid then, turning to subjects that had obviously shaped a greater impression on her mind, would tell her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very strongest nature of Aubrey; and she often told her the blade of the living vampy, which had spent years amalgamating her friends, and the dear lies, witched every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence during the months in vogue, the blood bis ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her by so many idle and dreadful fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of the old men, who had discovered at least an old man, after several of their close relatives and children, having found themselves marked by the trap of the child's call; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe her, sor, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always had evidence that forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess it. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, shouting a rather precise description of Lord Ruthuen; he, rainbow, still pacified in persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, though at the same time he wondered as many coincidences which had only lent to excite the belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling himself to moro and more to Ianthe; his encounter, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman omong that he bad rogue for his vision of love, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young English habit, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found even more attached to the almost magical form before him. He was tearing himself apart, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his object was attached; but he always found impossible at six his attention to the ruins around the hirn, but his mind held an image that assimilated only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank cold blood he had known for the first time. She always began to separate from him with reluctance, because she no longer had anyone who could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering some sragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parties on the subject of Vainpyref, and both, with a secret present, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the same name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, all at once begged not to return to laugh, because he had to necessarily pass through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the vampy resort in the night orgies of Tbeir, and denounced the heavy evils of the moft as imminent on the one who gilded to cross their way. Aub really made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh the cm of the idea; but when he shuddered them to his audacity, so as to mock a fuperjor, an infernal power, whose very name, apparently made the blood freeze, was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief in these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When it was forbidden to leave, Santa came beside his horse, and, bitterly flouted by him to return, the night passed by allowed the power of the Asian beings to be pulsed in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research that he did not per-\nThere was one of these spots that, in the climates of war, gathered so quickly in a trembling mass, and poured all their fury upon the devoured country .— He finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: but he was too late. In these southern climates, the almo salt is unknown; sunsets inevitably lie down, and the beginning is near; and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders were barely an interval — its heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the lighting forked blue seemed to full and radiates on its feet. Suddenly, this horse became afraid, and he was delivered with fear through the entangled forest. Last of the animal, by fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lighting, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel, almost barely rose from the masses of dead Ieaves and a brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to swallow him up to the fawn, or at least trust in getting outpouring of the storm. As he approached, the thunderers, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman mixing herself with the stifled thing, exu...\nHe laughed at a laugh, ran away from a disloyal sound ;— he was surprised: hut, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced to open the door of the hut. It was found in total darkness: however, the sound the guide. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds of him continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He found him in contact with someone, whom he took from them; when a voice cried out :\"Again bafsled!\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt distressed by an orian who seemed so strong superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as possible, he read; but it was in vain: he slipped into his sensation and threw himself huge blows on the ground :— his enemy threw him so on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his throat with his hands ,— when the brightness of many perishing torches through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, os he broke through the world, was no longer bearded. The form was still now; and Aubroy, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their tarpaulins fell on the mud, and the half loaded on any individual straw with heavy soft flakes. In search of Aubrecy, they sought her, who had drawn her with her cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torches flashed at her once, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a course without me. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when they were locked up, strained by his side. There was no color on his cheek, not even on his bore lip; but there was a stllnoss on his face that seemed to be the most attached like the lift that once lived there :— on his neck and broast waf hood, tight on his throat were the marks of teeth that opened the vein :— to this men pointed, weeping, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A Compare !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the side as his wife had already been for him, the object of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now snored with the flower of life that had died in the ber. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vaconity, he held almost unconsciously in the hand by a naked dagger of a particular correction, which was found to be wrong in the hut. They soon met with different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, announced the parents of draconian catastrophes. \" To describe the pain of their child would be impossible; but when they had accepted the cause of their child's death, he looked at Aubrcy, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsoble; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent fever most, and was osten deliriovs; in these intervals, he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a little inexplicable combinatiori, it seemed bcg of bls old composition to replace them being Ioved. To other linden trees, he permeated the calculations on his head, and cursed like his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, flouted at the time to arrive at Athcns, and, from any movement, at the hearing of the state of Aubrey, he immediately placed himself in the same compass, and became his constant waiting. When he recovered the srom bis delirium, he was horrlflod and amazed at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by kind words, irnplying olmost repentance for the Sault tot evil causod their separation, and even more by the gentt emotion, anxiously, and the care he showed, soon reconciling to his present. His sentence seemed completely changed; he appeared only the clpathic being who had so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not pierce any difference in the old one, except that at times, he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of molicious exultation that penetrated on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the 1st time of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was obviously committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, circling, like our world, the sun of the sheep ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this sbock, was greatly weakened, and this elastioness of mind that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, his desire for solitude, his spirit did not find him in the neighbourhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once had frequent, Ianthes from stood beside hjs — if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once had frequent, Ianthes from stood beside him in the woods, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, to his wilid imagination, his pale caress and his wounded throat, with a reborn smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, every when the actor created such bitter ossociations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he was bound by the tender carca which he had taken from the bim during his childhood, that they should visit these parts of Greece neither that had yet seen. They went to all the regions, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached; but, although they were so rushed from one place to another, they did not seem to take into account what they looked at. He put on a lot of robbers, but they began gradually to diminish these reports, that they imagined to be only the inverition of the individuals, of which it was in the interest to excite the generosity of those whom they deviated from supposed dangers. Due to the neglect of the inhabitants' opinion, once they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as their guides as a defense. On entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with the spirit of great masses of rocks descended from precipiceous tho, they had reasoried to repent their negative; if they were barely the whole party engaged in the narraw pafs, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echo of the rake of several cannons. In the first instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the came ratio. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the strong turn of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting badci advanced excavators, and to be exposed to the urresisting massacre, if one of the thieves should climb arid take them to the rear, they decided both to rush away in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder of the rock, which led him The grunter d. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, being no longer on himself or on his own peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately cast their arms and surmounted.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon irritated them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after accepting a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they merely kept the entranco until their comrade could return with the promised svm, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased rapidly; in two days the mortification followed, and the teeth seemed to progress rapidly. His behavior and appearance did not change; he seemed unconscious of pain cells. He had been objects on him: but towards the end of the last evening, his urid became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was induced your help more with more than the serious visual —\" Help me! I mean the riot of my life, I have heard the death of the existence only as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey said .—\" I need, but a little of my life flourishes, I cannot explain the whole thing, but if you hid everything you know from me, the honor money was free of stain in the world rnoulh, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Sweelr !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exultant violence :\"Swear by all that your soul resent, by all your fear, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crying or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes were kindled with their bases ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He fell laughing on his protruding, and breathed no more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circumstances saw his arrogance with this man rise up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a chilling cold upon him, as if the presentation of something horribly awaited him. Rifirig early in the morning, he was able to get the hole in which he had left the body, when a thief met blm, and informed him that he was no longer there, havirigbeen carried by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a neighborhood mountain, according to a promise they had given to his lord, that he would be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after the bif death. Aubrey was stunned, taking several of the men, determined to go and bury in the place where he was. But when he counted badly at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves noticed the same rockon that they had laid the body. For this is the moment when his mind was moved into conjectures, but he finally came back, he knew that they had ruined the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a backstage in which he had a word with Sueb terrible mistakes, and in which he also apparently conspired to increase this superstitious meancholy who had grasped his mind, which resolved to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While he was fighting for a ship to transport him to Toronto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there was one case of several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were arid daggers. By turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an apparent fheath in omarnendod in the same style as the dagger discovered in the falale hut—to be frantic—to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror may well imagine that he discovered that he was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; however, he still wanted the particulate form to be dissolved; but the same varying shades on the shaft and sbeat were similar in splendor on the bottom, and left no place for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Sm yrna, and on his way home, of Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady who had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the deportation of her secretary. The Aubrey's spirit almost broke under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of the Haitian destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only confessing profession exhorting the speed of postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived at Calais; a breeze, who seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way to the English coast; and he hastened to the mansjon of his father, and there, for a while, seems to be to be lost, in his sister's case and caresses, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infanline caresses, the blood gained its effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey didn't have that winning grace that won her eyes and applauded the assemblies of the drawer room. There was none of this light shine that exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was lit up by the reindeer's levity below. There was a melancholic charm about it that seemed not to come from misfortune, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate a tough soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, that he wandered where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was sedated and pensive. Alone, his face never lit the smile of joy; but when his horo-\nHe breathed his affection, and would have forgotten in his prefecture, those deed that he knew how to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the hell of volupluclary? It seemed that the eyes — the face was then playing in the light of the own nalive sphere. She was still usually eight cents, and had not been brought to the world. It was thought that by her guardian more in the form of her presentation should be delayed until the return of her brother from the counterint, when he could be his protector. That is why it is now resolved that the next drawing room, which was a quick approach to the irrig, should be the epoch of its entry into the \"busy scene\". Aubrey preferred to take refuge in the administration of the father's body, and fed melancholy that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind was fed by the events he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — the pick-up room had not been held to be a long lime, set in motion all those who were eager to rest in the kingship's smile, hastened there. An idiot was there with his sister. While he was stagnating in the corrier hy himself, the bees from all around him, erupted in remorse that the first time he had fen Lord Ruthuen was in this very place — he suddenly felt feigned by the clrm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remorse your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, afraid of seeing a spocter that would explode him, which he poked, to a little distance, the same figure that drew a bad remark in this place when he first entered society. He threw himself away until his limbs almost pushed back their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and force a crowd-trunked passage, he threw himself into his car, and was funny at home. He trampled the room with horrible steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his waste would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven long before him — circumstances began in the dreadful painting — the dagger — his oath .— He awakened him, he could not improve him — the dead resurrection again !— Ho thought that his imagination had conjured up the image of his mind was resting on. It was impossible that this was a reality — so he decided to go back to sociology; for he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung up his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few more nights with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and gave him his own devoring bumblebees. When he finally saw that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, with his sister surrounded by many, appeared apprehensively; he tried to pass by arid approach her, when he asked to move, turned around, and went back to help these traits, he masturbated in horror. And he went forth, and took his sister's arm, and, with a tainted step, forced her toward the street of Tbe; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were throwing themselves for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again that voice murmured near him —\"Remember the oats-\n\"He dared not to turn around, but when he rushed from his sister, he soon returned home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If harassing his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more corollary was just absorbed, now lbats the result of the monster's life once again pressed on its acronyms. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to explain to her what had caused her about conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who roasted it. The more he flirted, the more perplexed he was. His oath broke ;— Was he then allowed this monster to wander, leading to ruin his bre-?\nAnd, in the midst of all that, he loved, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and let him disclose suspicions, who would believe him? He was thinking of using his own hand to crush the world with evil; but death, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this station; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, far his sake, to support nature. Finally, I was more able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from street to the street, anxious to steal this image that was flouting him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight times. He was not a loriger to recognize; at first he turned back with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where the fatigue had spilled. His sister, anxious for his safety, entertained people to cool him; but they were soon removed by the hive that fled from a pursuer faster than the money – from the night. But, his box has changed. Struck by the idea that he felt by his absence lhe wholo from his friends, with a friend among them, of the presence that they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious your forearm, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a bluffed hallway and suspicious appearances carried so striking, his inner chills was visible, that his sister was finally forced to turn from him to abstairi to sow, for her, a society that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was appropriate to act and, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they thought it was a high time to resume the truce that had been imposed on them previously by our parents.\nDesiring to save him from the injuries and sufferings he had encountered in his wanderings, desiring to prevent him from exposing to the marks of the general eye, what they would consider slowly, they hired a pbysicist to reside in the house, and take the hard core of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind was completely absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence was finally so great that he was confined to his room. There was often hope for the day, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciatod, his eyes had otted a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and reminder that remained appeared on the eristry of his soster; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, would want her not to lick him well. \"Oh, don touch him, if your wing for me is great, don't come near him !\" Where, however, asked whom he referred to, his only answer was :\"True! True !\" And again, she sank in a state, from which she was even able to wake him up. This lasted for months, Mary graduated. However, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and the mind half threw a cold part of its morosity, while its guardians observed that the frosty times when the day would masturbate on his fingers a defined number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of selfishness, one of his guards entering his room, stuttered to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubreys situation being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. The grade of this brand of returning incorrectly, of which they feared that he was developed, they mentioned the riarno of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be preseritating the nuptials, and eager to drunk his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be asphyxiated by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, once again flowing at the height of his brother being living with the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his wonted warinthe, and to congratulate him on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and every achievement; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprise as observing the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He grabbed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the emblem of her future husband, he looked as if he had not understood her—Tben seizing her hands, and looking on beer with a frantic expression of face, he swore to her that she would never marry that monster, because he — but he could not advance — it seemed that if that voice bado reminded him of his oath — he turned suddenly, thinking Lord. Ruthen approached him, but didn't see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought that it was only a return to his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Aubrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, begged, begged them to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness, they imagined having seized the spirit, eradicated themselves to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after the drawing-rooin, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Auhreys ill health, he learned to be his cavsus; but when he cried out that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concocted from those among whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant atteridanee, and the claim of great affectivejon for the brother and interest in his fate, he was gradually the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to retract—could speak of hissels as an undivided having without syinpathy with anyone being on the crowded earth, savc with whom he addressed ;—could say how, as he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it was simply that he could enumerate his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. As the title of the elder branch falling to Lenglh at HLM, he obtained a major embassy, which served as an excuse for bastening the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of beer brother ,) which was to bring to take the day before the high exportation for the counterint.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guards, tried to bribe the fervors, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; just was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her happiness owri, her own hanour, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who held him in their bristles as their hope and the hope of the house of toil, to delay bvt for some battle burs, on which he denounced the heaviest curscs. The servants of them have spoken that they will deliver him; but by giving him to the doctor, he has better not harass the spirit of Misf Aubreyby any more, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without resting the busy lnmates of the house; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that may be more easily oonived than described, the notes of the occupied preparation. Hello, and the carriage sound broke on his ear. The Aubrey grew up in extreme French. The curiosity of the servants at the laft overrearne their voice, they gradually evaded, leaving him in the study of a belpless old woman. He seized the opportunity, with bound once, was out of the room, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by wounds, a bim pressed from the coin, without voice with courage. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\" Join your oath, and know, except for my fiancée, that your sister is dishonored. Women are scared !\" So said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury found no vent, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, holding the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nBlood effusion produced symptoms contrary to the near tooth approach. One could call his sister guardians, and when he had struck midnight, he wrote down what the reader had perpetrated — he dictated immediately afterwards.\nThe guard was protected by Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was a long place. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nREPORT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRONICS.\n\"The world was all in front of the hive, where to choose his resting room, and Providence his gossip .\"\nIN Sail through the Greek Archipelago, aboard one of His Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, iri, the island of that narne. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have there, induces many British ships to visit it — both men of war and inorcbantmen; and instead to fit it off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums largely prepare for the deviation of a voyage. We dropped; as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the proper trading for cattle with the natives, the clergy and myself took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and the other places where we had been before. On the front of the Ida (a small mo native so named) we met and engaged a Greek young like our gvid, who told us that he had become from Scio with an English lord, who left the Islond four days before our ardual to be felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said Tbe Greek ,\"Clnd would have taken a line with him; but I didn't choose to leave Mitylene, where I like to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. He left him an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ,) arid recast there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his very osten felucca towards the various islands .\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose momentum in the haste at home where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us into the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a decorated bed, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on the either side, a lar ge mystery in the center, and a fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches of them by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Venus bronze in a leaning posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room there were a half dozen English canes, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single brush. The bedroom had only one large mattress on the float, with two cotton duvets stuffed around a pillow — the common bed in Greece. In the installation room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books and papers, who were then into a large box of marinan in the closet: it was a repen, but we do not think we are justified in the examination of the contents. The works of Voltairc, Shakspeccle, Boileau and Rousfeau are finished on the tablet of the re-creation; the Rulns of the Empires of VoIney; Zjmmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller des Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 181 O; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with the slips of paper, which were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must live until his return; for it is so special that if I move a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I did it one day; and I have products of his farm for the trouble to take the ear of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of external use of that was playing. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pearls of canned marble with black plinths and fret cornices (as it is now usual in the German bow ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend evenings smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the breeze being evening.\nOn the left hand, we enter the house, a small streamlct glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shape of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden baek was placed, on which were lold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until the time of the twelvc, reading, wiling, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed because he was truthful, and that he always frequented our chureb twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this spot was what we could call \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blaom inyrte, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it lasted in the woods near the bass of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizori not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view iri front; and a little on the left, through a view of high palm trees and chcsnut, several small islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely saw more than I did; but our requests were conclusions as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name, but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. e :\" The Army....\nNian, said our conductor, could say it, but I am sure he won ,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said, if I can ,\" he said ,\" I daren. \" We had time to visit the Armenian, based on our return to the city, we learned several details of isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to the man once, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He bought a new boat far away a fisherman who had lost his own in a village, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from everything we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we learned that our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to dissect. He had a very beautiful daughter, with which the lord was often seen walking along the shore of the sea, and he had bought hera piano-forte, and taught him the use of himself.\nThis was the right information that we left from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all over the road, guess who this Greek rain blue could be. He had money just was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all the eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling with Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\" who you are so worried about, if Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenodos, and I took him to Mitylcne .\" We had then heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had begun a few years from home; but \"Chied Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on each page. Did we not regret not being more curious in our search for eating, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, disdaining her not entirely uninteresting, and in court to the good drama of her secretary, which has been grossly slandered. He described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is terribly inverse, like only being plairily gathered from these little anecdotes. I have finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly portrayed in his seniory poems, seems to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, and apprehension to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason for rnarking hirn as a being on whose heart, religion has scanned his seal, and to ours whose hecld Benevolcence hastened his manth on. No man can read the \"traits\" of previous pleas without being proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right and to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of a man; and the one who dares to justify himself before a terrible court where all must appear, cannot censor the errors of a confreremortal. Lord Byrori's character is a worthy of genius bis. Making cakes in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approval.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, The Flcet-sleet.",
    "24": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very geriatric to the East. Arnong thc Arabians it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of the Christianity; it took its present form only from the division of the Latin and Greek churches; hect at what moment, the increasingly widespread idea, that a Latin badger could not corrupt is buried in their territory, it increased gradually, arid formed the subject of many wonderful looks, still existing, of the rising death of their tombs, and foeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some variation of weight, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, on Lorraine, where the beef existed, that the vampyres nig htly soaked a certificate of the blood of their uictims, which emaciated the eoarn, have lost their strength, and some die bone consumption; while human tbese blood-suckers fattened — and the veins of lhelr became distended at such a state of reconstitution, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even of the verypores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, is a credible and, of course, a serious account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is declared to have occurred in Madreyga, in Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they have stated positively and without complacency that, with regard to the yoclers of life.\nhe, a certain Heyduke, dwarf Arnold Paul, had been heord to say, that, in Cassova, on the brothers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, arid rubbing himself to his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from fraternizing a vampyro himself; for six or twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a deposilation was made, that four people had been deprived of father by his attacks. In order to avoid the furious malformations, the inhabitants of Bavirig consulted their Hcldagni, took the body, clnd ring (as it is supposed to be usual in the casos of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free corruption of srom, arid emitting to movth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was quite through the heart and heart of Arnold Paul, where he turned back from shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his pearl, burned his body, and put the ashes in his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the caresses of people who had died in bad times before from vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents proud of other ways to survive them.\nThe universal heli is, it is a person sucked by a vampire, ocomas of vampy himself, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it is better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations than any other like which could be produced. In any part of Greece, it is considered as a sorle of punishment after death. If it is a most committed heirly crime that exists, that the deceived riot is condemned only to homage, but obliged to limit its infernal visltations solely to those beings that he loved most at the top of a land, those to whom he was bound by the ties of klndred arid affeelion .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from his tomb; and thou hast haunted the place of origin, and defiled the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life: yet hate the banquet which he persecutes Mvst shall feed thy living corveh, thy victims, which still exhale, shall know the devil to be sore; as thou cursest them, thy flowers shall be wilt a rod. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will engulf your heart in the flame! And yet, the last glassfy g throws sees what freezes his lifeless blue, then, with a hand without Halloween, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock on the occasion of the birth of the tenderest engagement of the Aff election was worn — But now it is carried away by the memorial of light agony! But if your owl is the best, it flows; your grinning tooth, and your harging lip; then, chasing your tomb, going away, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, till these in the harror depart from the cursed specter than the thcy.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr course of the young girl of Arabion Oneiza, who was presented as having returned from the tomb of Tobe with the aim of tomorrow, better loved during his existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, it has been spilled throughout history as a compute type of purity and innocence. Tour vampyrism gives a long story in his travels of several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he attaches himself to drooling was an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his groat work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that he is a classic, as well as a barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible smoking could be added; though this present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that although the term Vampyre is that in the most general eceplation, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brovcoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT happened trot in the middle of the dissipation of a lho on a London winter. It appeared to the various parties for the leaders of the ton a problemman, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate in the theatre. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and cast fear into those brafs that were insensitive. They felt this feeling of admiration, could not explain from where it lay: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whipping on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and the arious gaze to pierce through the inner functioning of the heart; bvt fellon the cheek with a ray of lcaden that weighed on the skiri he could not pass. His pocularities invited him into all the houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accused of violent arousal, and who were now engaged in boredom revenge, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging the attention. Despite the mortal huo of her fao, who never won a warmer turn, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although they were beautiful form and outline, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to win, at least, some marks of the qualification they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the pain of all the monsters she had chained in the dragling rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a mountain bank, drawing her attention :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, her eyes were apparently fixed on her, he still shook as if they were not seen ;— even her vnappal walls bafouled fornication, and she left the field of them. But the adulterous commandman could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the sex tho female was indifferent to him: but this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the uirtuous woman and innocent girl, who sewed knew that he had never addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and whether it was that he had overcome the fear of his singular character, or this they carried moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was often among those male feties who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic virtues, bones among lhosc that push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time, there was your London, a young man named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while still in childhood. Left to himself by guardians, if they were simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the original important charge of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, John, this high sense of honor and romantic candour, which definitely ruined so many apprentices of soldiers. He all pleaded for spiritual virtue, and thought that vice was cast by Providence more for the peaceful effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: it was tantamount that the misery of an oottage consisted simply of a vestige of clothes, which were as warm, but that we would do better adapt to the painter's eye by irregular folds and vorious coloured patches. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of the police were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their langvishing or rupturering favorjles: the donors at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by his sparkling eyccles, when he opened his lips, soon led him to notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the aroma of his lonely hours, he was surprised by the sin, that, except in the tallow and the candles of thal wax clicked, not in the presence of a ghoft, but for lack of snow, there was no ringing in real life for any of these congreries of folding images and dosimbjons conteclid in these valours, from which he had sowed his study. Faithful, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary thing we described above hit him his career.\nHe observed it, and it was very imprudent to form an idea, the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who had few other signs of his observation of cternal obiecls, that agreement acted to their existence, implied by the avoidance of the contact of man: allowing his imagination to imagine all that flattened his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object into the heroism of a novel, and determined to observe the outpouring of his frequency, rather than the person before him. He took hold of him, gave him attention, and so far, in his opinion, advariated that his presence was recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Stevens officers were embarrassed, and soon found, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirousos obtaining some information respecting this singular character, which, until now, had only whipped his civriosity, he suggested to his guordians, that it was time to bim to perform the tovr, which for many generations has been necessary to young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, scandalous inlrigues feast are mentioned as sub-jocts of pleasant or os praise, according to the degree of competence they had in the car --\nI am trying them on. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions, your Lord Ruthven, wossured your receipt of him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a lack of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other minds, be happy to accept it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrcy had not had the opportunity to study Lord Rutbvens character, and now he has found that, many more of his actions have been expressed from his point of view, the results of researching different conclusions of the appear olives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idlo, the vagrant, and the bogie, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing that it was the riot upon the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes of the waiter, even on virtue, that he granted him his alms ;— these were sons of the gate of Tbe with barely repressed sne ers; but when the profligate caine asked for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to flatter himself in his Iust, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed by him to the greatest importance of vicious trouble, which wields him over the crumbling scorn of virtuous indigents. There was a circumstance about the shariat of his Lordship, which was even more impossed on his mind: all those on whom was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to put the lowest and the most abject misory tob. In Brussels and other cities, through the passage of the city, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent narrowness of his companion, who was looking for the centres of all fashionable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: to be wagered, and always played successfully, to seize where the strongest known was his antagonist, then to be lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally observed the society around: he waf, however, not if, when he encouraged the eruption young novice, or the chanceless father of a great family; then he wishes very forlone the law — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of food while dallyling with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, torn from the circle he adorned, cursing, in the solitude of a dungeon, the destiny that had attracted him to the reach of this friend; while many of a fathor sat frenetic, in the midst of the eyes talking of mute children hurigry, shaking a single farthing of his dead immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient fuel their thirst for prescript. However, it is necessary to take money from the game table tob; but immediately Iost, to the ruincrof a lot, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: that night, but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most experiential. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged Hiin to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not lend for his own profit ;— but he delayed him — every day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lipot; and although Aubrey was the object of his curiosity, he did not gratify only the dismaying excitement of whipped vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the presence in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he was crying in search of the inemorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first came from hiftister, breathing nothing from the hut faction; the others came from bis guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered the imagination bis that there was a eurel of power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him enough reason for the belies. His guardians insisted that he immediately left his friend, and exhort, that his character was terribly vicious, for the Possation of irresistible powers of seduction, made his licentious bacits more dangerous to your society. It turned out wrong, that his contempt for adultery had not been born of a hatrode of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to revive his gratification, that bis victim, the partner of his guilt, should rush from the plennocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, all the women whom he had fought, apparently on the account of their virlue, had, from his departure, set aside the same mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey suspected a bezel whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent somo plclusible pretext to abandon it completely, purposive, in the meon while, to watch it more closely, and let not light circumferences go unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordsbip was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with the company in; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon distraught that an assignment had been designated, which would mast probably end in the ruin of the annocent, although the girl I. Don't waste time, he entered Lord Ruthvens party, and suddenly asked him for his iritentions of the lody, insorning him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to have him that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he would all have thrown himself on such abhorrent parties; and after having been pressed if he would go to marry him, only laughed. Unbrey, withdraw...\ned; and, immediately writing to notice, to say, from that moment on, he must disappoint accompanying his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his seruanl to look for other apartments, and rocking on the lady's mother, informed him of all hernew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also concerning him cartaoter to bis Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthuen the next day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not suggest any suspense of his plans having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey took his steps towards Greece, and crossed the Peninfula, quickly found a little athens. He then repaired the house of a Greek; and soon occupied bimsclf by tracing the faded traces of ancient glory on monumcnts that apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of freemontbe only bosore sloves, had hidden themselves beneath the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof is attached to himself, there exists a beautiful and delicate being, which she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to spread on the carivass the promised hope of the faithful in the paradise of Mohammed, except that her eyes frown too mild for anyone you think that it could belong to those who had no soul. As such danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought the gazelle a bad type of his beauties; for whom would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eyec of the nature of animatod, for that luxurious sleep look of the animal suitable but to taste an epic. Although the light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, would show all the beauty of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, in the eyes of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased lablet, in the contemplation of his sylpha figure. Often, his braids fell, weakened, displayed him in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the shades, he might well excuse the oblivion of the clntiquary, which let escape from his mind the abiect of the Uery which he had before thought vital importance for the correct interpretation of a pafsage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, that no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, truth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew these white ho novels, he wanted to preserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, arid looking at the magic of his pencil, by drawing the scenes of his native place; she would then describe him the dance encircled on the operating plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage which she remembered to look at in her childhood; arid theri, lunning to the subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supernatural tales of his laugh. Her fervour and her apparent vanity of what she laughed expiated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as she had cut off the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, before each year, by attaching to the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he stunned for the laughter of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had finally noticed that one living between them, after the knowledge of their close relatives had been found of children marked with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when she found him so incredulous, she begged him to believe it, for he had pointed out that those who had dared to seek the existence of the Jr, had always found proof that forced them, with pain and broken heart, to confre themselves. She stripped him of the traditorial appearance of these monsters, and his horror multiplied, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord Rulhven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered for many coincidences that had all tended to exoite a hell in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to clnthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought the vision of Romanoe, wori his heart; and while being ridiculod the idea of a young man of skilled English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still faund hesolf plus and moro attached to this almost form of fairy before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he left, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he still found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins, the arourid, which in his mirid, he killed the image clean which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and he always had the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but she was unhappy because she had no more than one with whom, she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several prefects, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey was cutcrmined to proceed upon one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the room, they all begged him not to return at night, as he must unjustly pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had eclipsed, on any consideration. They deserinated it as the resort of the Emperor in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils like impending on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their rehearsals, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently caused the blood to freeze, he was silent.\nNothing Aubrey went on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and he was concerned that his pupils, mocking the belief of these perverts, had inspired them to such a terror. When he fought, Nathan came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night was over, allowing the power of the Russian beings to be pulsed in action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that iri that the horizon there was one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their rage upon the devoted land .—He finally, hawen, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost uriknawn; immediately the sun sets, the nigbl begins; and it had advanced far. The storm's power was above – its thunders failing had barely a resting interval – its heavy rain forced the passage through the enveloping foliage, while the blue highling of fourkcd seemed to fall and radiate at its own feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible through speed entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighbourhood of a hospital which did not itself list masses of dead leclves and brushwood which surrounds it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust a storm shelter. As he approached, Thehunderf, for a while silent, allowed him to hear the horrors of a mirigling woman with a stifled, the exuberant mockery of a laugh, cortinued in a sound almost uribroken ;—he was scattered: but, eaten up by tho thundcr who rolled again on the head bis, he, with a hard effort, forced the door of the hut. He himself sounds in darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not aware of it; for, although he called, the sounds were still heard, and nothing was taken of him. He found himself in contact with someone, he immediately split; when a voice cried out :\"Agari floundered !\" to which he succeeded a great laugh; and he went to the hands of a man whose foot seemed superhuman: determined to sell the bise as expensive as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on him, and knelt on his head, had seized his hands on his beats — when the brightness of many torchcs penetrating through the hole that gave the light in the day, disturbed him ;— he rose up angryly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant the bruhahahahahahaha, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. This storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They cling to the light of their torches falling on the wall of the mud, and of the stubble charged on each straw with soft flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he turned into darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again b hurt on the bim, to perpetuate the aerial form of his beautiful canducer brandished a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same sleep, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; yet there was a silence above his face, which splattered almost as fondly as the life that once dwolt thore :— on his neck ber and chest was blood, and upori his throat were the marks of leeches having opened the vein thc :— to that the meri pointed, weeping, simultaneously floated with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter box was formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had lately been to him from the object of so many brigbite and airy visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in it. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was flouted and seemed to run away from the reflection, and take charge of the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had found 6 th in the cabin. They were sunny by different parts that had been engaged in the sea bones that her mother had missed. Their weeps lamentably, as they approached the city, warning the parents of a terrible catastrophe. —Explore their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsequential; both died in the heart of the brokon.\nAubrey boring put to bed was seized with a vlolen fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a responsible coin he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare being that he loved. At other times, he would permeate the curses on his hoof, and curse him from his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive at Athens, and, from the whalers' motive, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When he recovered in his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whom he had the image of a Vampyre, Lord Ruthven bull, by his kind words, involving almost repentant for this fault which had caused their separation, and still inore by the attention, the arixety, and the nucleus which he showed, soon concluded his presence. His seigneury seemed to be changing; he only appeared to be an aptistic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but cls son that the convalesconce of hjf began to be fast, he gradually retired into the same stote of mind, and Aubrey pierced rio differentencc from the former man, was surprised that sometimes he met his game fixedly on him, with a smile of maliciovs exutation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the Inualid, Lord Steven was apparently committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of the lhose orbs, clinging, like our world, to the still svn ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of the mind that had once distinguished him so well now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find just jn tho near Athons; if he were to do so in the midst of the ruins which he had once frequered, the form of Ianthe stood at his faithfulness — if he sought him in the woods, his stepight would be appeclr wondering almost theunderwood, in search of the inode st violet; then suddenly, turned around, would show, to his wild imagination, out of pale face and wounded lhroot, with a small touch on his lips. He deleminated to steal scenes, every bone window that created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, that he had been bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they had not yet seen those parts of Greece. They dragged in all directions, and sought every place where a memory could be attenuated; but while they hadtened from one place to another, they did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to shed light on these relationships, which they imagined only as the invention of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generosity of those they defended from the pretoned dangers. As a result of this neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, for a moment, they were lurking with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as deferries. At the time of taking hold of it, however, a narrow defilement, to which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the precipices, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly all the parties engaged in the narrow plss, when they were fertled by hissing tbe bullets, bones cling to their head, on the ratio echoed of several cannons. In an insound, their guards had left them, and by placing them behind the rocks, they had begun to take the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Auhrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, withdrew for a moment behind lho by sheltering the bend of defilement; but shameful to be so shot down by an enemy, who, with cries of lnsvlt, advanced them, and being explained to a enslaved, if one of the thieves were to ascend above and take them to the rear, they decided once to rush forward in search of the enemy. They lost the shelter of the rock, when the Lord Rutbven received a shot in the shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his distrust; and, longer to meet or to his own peril, the son was surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the Lord, even being thrown, immediately threw their arid arms away.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby club; the having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence of beeir — they were keeping the entrance until their command returned with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. If the conduct and appearance could not change; it seemed that there was no awareness of the pain towards him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his osten of the eye on Avbrey, who was accustomed to his help with more serious usual —\" Help me! You can enchant me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the day passing; but you can save my honor, the horror of your friend. \"\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \" I need a hot, I need my life. I can explain everything to you. \" But if you were to hide me, you know me, my honor was free of stain in the front of the world, and my death has been unknown for some time in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, crying violently :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature, swear that during the year and one day you will not communicate your knowledge of my life or death to any living being in any way, a whaler may occur, or a whaler that you can see. \" His eyes seemed to spring out of their bases :\" I swear !\" The Scilide Number...\nHe sank laughing on his pillow, and didn't breathe any injuries.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many eruptions that attended his trick with this man upon his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, the shivers of gold came upon him, as if it came from the presentation of something horrifying to hold him. Rjsing early in the morning, he was obsessed with entering the coffin in which he had left the body of lho. When a thief met him, arid informed him that he was no longer there, having was transported by himself and the cornades, at his retirement, your pinacy of a neighbour movement, according to the cl prornise that they gave his seigneury badly, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the rnoon that arose after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and took several of the men, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the summit, he found no trace of eltbering the body or the ciothes, although the robbers swore that they were penetrating the identical rock on which they had placed the body. For a time, his mind was perplexed in conjections, because he finally came back, convinced that they had drunk the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWoe to a country in which he had melancholy with such terrible evils, and in which all apparently conspired to raise this superstitious melancholy who had seized his mind, he breathed to leave him, and soon arrived at Sinyrna. Well, waiting for a ship to send him to Otranto, or to Naples, took care of organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there were several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several diggers and Afghanistan. While turning them around, and oxamining curious forms, the whale was surprised to find a puff apparently adorned in the same stylism as the dagger discouraged in the fat al hut — he trembled — seized the furious proof, he found the weapon, and his horror rnay back imagined when he discovered that it was equivalent, albeit in shape, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to need greater certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted no one to believe; but the particular form, the same different shades on top of the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splendour ori botb, and left the rio place to doubt; there were drops of ori blood each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back, left Rome, the first investigations checked the lady that he mistried the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in the distros, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of this lordship. The Aubrey spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of the Santa destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the lift of some expensive child hc. Arrived at Calais, a breezc, who seemed obedient to the will, soon threw him on the shores of the English; and he hastened to seize the home of his fathers, and the lrc, for a moment, seems to lose, iri, embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by his infantile caresses, he acquired his affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an companion.\nMiss Aubrey is not the winning grace that wins against and applause from the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shining that the exhaust is only the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the health of the spirit. There was a melancholic charm that obeyed it, which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a few tributaries inside, which clinged to indical a soul consequently of a brighter kingdom. His step wasn't so light, which misleads a bitutterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but that his brother grated to his affection, arid wanted in his presence to forget these claws. She knew that he had flouted his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes — the face was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not seen 6 presperity in the world. He was overwhelmed by hcr guclr dianf more appropriate than his presentation should be 6 delay the return of a brother of until hcr from the contrary, that he could have his protector. It was now that the blue lounge, which, approached quickly, moved away from its entrance into the interior of the \"busy scene\". Aubrey would have stayed in the nation of fathers, and fed melancholy that conquered him. Ho could feel interested abducting the frivolities of the fashionablo foreigners, when he had been so torn by the events he had seen; but he discouraged him from sacrificed his own comfort to the protection of his sisler. They soon entered the city, and prepared for the day event, which had been announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was expensive: a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, hastened to die. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaging in the remembranoe that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthveri was in that same place, he suddenly felt seizod by his arm, and a voice that he rebuked to well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your oath .\" He had the hard turn of the courtago to fearful of seeing the irig cl spectrum that would explode him, when he pierced, at a distance from a little, the same figure that had drawn attention to this place at his first entry society. He looked at his members almost by refusing to be their weight.\nthat, he began to take the torch of a friend, and forced a passage through the crowd, and threw it in his car, and returned home. He hastened with steps and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared his sighs would burst out of his brain. Lord Rulhven again before he — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath .— He mocked himself, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead were resurrected again !— He thought his imagination had concirced upwards of the immogene his mind rested on. It was impressive that it could be real — so he decided to return to into society; although he tried to ask to conceive Lord Ruthven, the name sung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and there he gave himself his devouring dicks. At last, when he saw that money was fainting, he woke up, and adorning another room, found his sister svroved by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach the beer, when once, who was asked to move, turned around, and straightened up to him the traits of those which he masturbated in horror. And he went forth, and shook his sister's arm, and in haste gave him up to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was busy passing them, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :«Remember your oath !”\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thought. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what caused her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and thought terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His death surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying a ruin on his chest, in the middle of all to be held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspicions, who would upset him? He thought he would use his own hand to extract the world from such a misery; the death of a hut, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he sowed no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes full of tears, begged bim, for her, to beg nature. Finally, he is no longer able to accommodate himself of calm and solitude, he is first his house, moved from street to street, anxious to fly that the image would haunt him. His dress ravaged, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer recognized; he returned first with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for security brief, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him to fled from a pursuer faster than any thought-fram. His conduct, a rainbow, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all the big friends, with a friend among them, of the presence of which they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and to watch him closely, anxious to anticipate, in the spy of his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimcence. But if he entered a room, his discontented and rogue eyes were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that struck him so hard. When, in fact, remission proved to be unwavering, the guards intervened and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they believed that it was a high time to regain the trust that had previously been imposed upon them by the parents of Avbrey.\nDesiring to save the hiin from the insults and sufferings he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing himself to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor to the resident in the house, and take the correction takes care of him. It did not appear to notice, so completely the mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great, that he found the room of inconsistency. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and of the remaining election displayed itself at the entrance of his sisler; then he would start sometimes, and, sewing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't come near him, if you love me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she spoke to whom he resisted, her only answer was :\"Truly! True !\" Orid again, he sank in a state, which couldn't even roam it. It has been several months: gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies have become less frequent, and its spirit has cast a part of its shadow, while its obscured guardians, as the moments of villains in the day, it lurks on his fingers, a defined number, and then srnil e.\nThe time had almost passed, when, upon the last day of the year, one of his guardians inherited his room, began to covet with his doctor on the melancholy circumstances of the being dubery in such a horrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Iristly Aubrey was attracted to the attention; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this brand of returning together, the bones that they faked it had been depraved, they set up the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed to plead, and astonished them even more by expressing his best intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his heart, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished as to arid rank each accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lockot on his chest; to open it, which unhappily his surprise to see the features of the monster who had long influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frantic espresso of Countrice, he told her to swear that she would not like to marry this monster, because he—but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice made him remember once again his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard what was, and who thought that he was only a return from his disorder, attracted him, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to disdain him. He fell on his knees to them, he begged, he screamed like them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the unsanitaryness they imagined, had symbolically the possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Rulhven had called the mother after the sitting room, and had been refused with all the others. When he seized Aubreys calamity, he easily realized that he was the cause; but when one learns that he was considered a jnsane, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed snoring those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by constant presence, and by the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who is the cold resisting power bill? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with the one or the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself ;—could say how, as he knew her, her existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not that he migrated to listen to his soothing accents ;—iri well, he kries so well how to use the art of the lho serpent, or such was the will of fact, though he won her affections. The title of the elder branch falls to him at length, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was also taking place the day before his departure to contact him.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe the scrutinists, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a paper; it was given to him; he wrolea letter your hjs sister, enjoring her, os she enjoyed her own philosophy, her own honaure, and the honor of lhose now in the grave, which anyone held her in their arms as their hope and the boop of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the most cursed cursed. The servants of Tbe promised that they would deliver him; and give him your doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubreys spirit any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the hour; and Aubrey heard, with horror that the hub was designed more easily than described, the node of the occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of brake carriages on the bis ear. Audrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilarice, he gradually moved away, leaving him an inch guard of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with an affair, was out of the room, and in the cold moment found himself in the apartment where he was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him, and immediately he took his arm by force, and cast him out of the ridge without a voice with the rag. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\" Remember your aath, and know, if my fiancée does not want to do, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his allies, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer support himself, his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was sent to bed. It wasn't his sister's schoolwork, who wasn't there when we came in, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bridal and the husband left London.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; the outpouring of proverb symptoms of blood of near approximate death. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he wrote down what the reader had perpetuated — he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sifcher had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nTHE ACCUEIL OF LORD BYREN RESIDENCE, etc.\n\"The world awaits him, where to choose his place of rest, and the guide of Providence .\"\nEN Sailing through the Grcian Archipelago, aboard one of its ships Mcljesty, in the year 1812, we put into the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this piece, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be used, induce mary ves salts British to visit it, both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather above the track sor ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums reimburse a great deal for the distance of a voyage. We disembarked, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the rren became involved in the water, and the sacriller negotiated for the cattle with the shipwrecked, the clergy and I took a ramble to the cave called Homer's School, and to other places where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (cl small mound so narrated) we met and engaged the young Groek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island the day before our arrival in his felucca. \"He struck me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he would have taken me to look for him .\" I didn't choose to leave Mltylene, where I might get married. He was a weird man, but a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he has an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails his felucca very after the various islands .\"\nThis ran into our curiosity a lot, and we did not lose the lime in the haste to the haufo where our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who drove us over a private hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, in the entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were simply decorated: Greek walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a smileful smail underneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a lean pasture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furnipper. In the room were held stalls, a dazeri English lunch, and an empty case book: there were not mirrors, nor a single pairing. The bedroom had only one large mattress on the floor, with two stuffed colton duvets and one pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Unfortunately, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, who then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open ,06:00 We did not think that our own elements were justified by the examination of their content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaires, Shakespeares, Boileau, and Rousseou's warks complete; Volney's Ruins of Empjres; Zimmermori, in the German language; K1opstock's Messiah; Kotzebues noves; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Parcldise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, muoh torn, but no English book of any description. Most of the hesis books were filled with marginal notes, written in a pencil, Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and truffled with sheets of paper, one that also was romarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had sew these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot your place with others; but there he must lie until his return; for he is so special that if I move a thing without order, he would sling me for a week together; he is in other ways very good. One day I did him a service; and I had the charge of this farm, and I had the penalty of the king, twenty zechins, whom I paid to an elderly Armenian who dwells in a little cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know about what reason .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and broad front, and the pillars of marble canned with black pants and work carnices of frets ,( as it is now usual in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone halustrade, was covered with a beautiful procession from Turkey, under the annoulage of coarse strong linen. Most of the aro top houses thus furnished, as on the cm the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lclchryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the back hand, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden back plate, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very pious, that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday .\"\nThe view of this seat was what he could sneeze \"a bird view .\" A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covering olive with and myrlle trees in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesto decomposition. A small stream that emitted water into the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the baso of the mountain. The srnooth sea as glass, and a horizori not overshadowed by a singlelc cloud, lermines the view in front; and a little on the left, through a v ista of noble cbesnut and pamlrees, several islands srnal 1 woro distinotlyobserved, studying the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than what I did; but our requests were fruitful on the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our tough man ,\"could say it, but I sure he won\" he said ,\"and you tell the cannol, old friend,\" he said ,\"if I can,\" he said ,\"I don't dare\". We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared the young girls right when he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, borrowed to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by boasting these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he presented himself to us, from the club we have collected, for having been very eccentric and the character brilliant. A circumstratory we have learned, which our old friend at the bottle considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations everything on the rack, guessing that crawling them in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of dispositiori, and all the eocontricities hose that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in company with Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"Tbe an individual, said to him, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the farne of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Children\" being pulled in the hands of over, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on every page. Did we regret not having been more serious in our research on the cottage, but we became corisolated with the idea of returning to Mitylene on the day of the future, but to me that day I will come back. I made this statement. He is not entirely intimidating, and in justice to the good reputation of his secretary, which was grossly gloomy. It has been described as an unsightly disposition, contrary to the association with human nature, or able in any way to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as nobody clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderncess, syinpathy and charity seem to guide all his actions: and his participation in the rest of loneliness is an additional reason to mark him as a boing on whose heart Religiori put his soul, and on which the hoax Berievolence threw his annuitant. No man has read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without being proud of him as a peasant. While respects his love or pleasures, I do not aspire to a right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this horrible court before all must a pear, only can censor the errors of a martel. Lord Byron's character is worthy of this genius. Making the right secret, and escaping the purpose of the world, is the truest testimony of a virtuous and self-approving conversation.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "25": "A VAMPYRE:\nA Time.\nBy John Williain Polidori.\nThe superstition concept that this place is founded is very general in the class. Among the Arabs, he appears to be in common: he did not, however, extend his sons to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiaria; and he did not assume his present forrn from the TB division of Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming prevalenl, that a body of Latin could not corrupt if it was buried on their territory, he increased gracefully, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, he fainted, with a slight varialion, all over Hungary, Poland, Austrio, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the night vampyres jmbibed a cerlain porlion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumption; while these blood-suokers-hvman fattened—and their hecamed veins were distended to such a state of repletian, as cavse the blood to fascinate from all passages of their bodios, and even pores even from their skins.\nIn the Loridon Journal, of March 1973, is curious, and, of course, credible account of a particular ease of vampyrism, which is slaled for having taken place in Mcldreyga, Hungary. It appears that, during the examination of the commander-in-chief and the regulations of the place, they unanimously affirmed that about five years earlier, a certairi Hcyduke, riamed Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had found a way to get rid of the evil, by eating the somo of the earth from the grubbing of the vampyre, and rubbing his sons with blood of hjs. Precaution, however, does not prevent him from being a vampire himself; for, about a goy or thirty days to fly his affair and burial, many people complained of being torpedoed by the thing, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prove other malices, the inbabitants who have consulted their Hadagni, tap the body, and find it (as it is supposed to be usual in vampyrism cases) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emit to the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. The proos having been thus obtained, they resorted to the Ibe customed today. A stake was led entirely through the heart and body of Arnold Paul, where it is reported, love also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and cast his body, and cast the bass into his grue. The same measures were adopted with the course of people who had already died from vampyrism. I am that they should, iri like turri, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a computer becomes a vampire, hesels, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis rodomontade moristrouf is linked to a hero. It is better suited to illustrate the subject of the observations presents that any other instance that could be conducted. Iri of many parts of Greece it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a erime heiress committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his visits infernal only to the beings he loved most while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and effect .— A suppofition alludes to in the \"Giclour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent him, Your horn comes out of his tomb, and you haunt the rite, and you suck the blood of all your offspring; from there, from your daughter, sister, wife, to the drain rnidnight tho slream of life; yet the trick of the banquet that performs must feed your living force, Your victims, they still expire, Sball knowtho deinon for their sire; as the cursed Shoe, you curse them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. If a test for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will it not be 6 c with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet, lbou must follow your task and mark the last tint of his coke — his last spork eye, and the 1st glassy glance must see who sneezes his lifeless blue; then with a hand without defilement will tear the braids of his ycllow hair, including, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — But now is broken far from you Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth and thy lip shall heap; and after the sullen tomb, go, and with Gouls and Afrils rave, until these in horror depart from the cursed Inore Speclre that they.\nMr. Soulhey presented also in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire horse of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having come back from the grave in order to torment him whom she loved while exiled. But this cannot be plentiful for having resulted from the sinfulness of his life, being spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account of several amazing cases of vampyrism, which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illuslative of his effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbarism.\nMariya curious and interesting noties about this singularly boring fuperstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limit of a note, nearly dedicated to explanaljan, clnd which can now be concluded hy simply remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with lt, makes use of in different parts of the world TB: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIT happeriod that in the institute of dissipations accompanying a London winter, it appeared to the various parties of the three leaders of the ton a nableman, more remarkable for its singularities, that rank hif. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laugbtor of the fair attracted only the situation, so that he could by a look thatll he, and throw fear in those breasls where the unwisesf reigned. Thofe, who felt this admiration, could not explain where she came from: some attributed him the deod grey cye, which, staring on the ace of the object of Tbe, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to picture through the inner wheels of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a lea den rcly which weighed on the skin he could not pass. His peculiarities made Bim be invited to every house; all wanted to split him, and those who had been used to the exciting violence, and now felt the weight of boredom, were ploughed to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. Iri despite the bitten hue of her face, which never took on a warmer hue, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her shape and contours were fabulous, mary of the feminine hunt after the notoriety aspired to gain her attentions, arid gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been mocking all the monsters of the drawing rooms since her marriage, pierced himself in her way, and did anything but put on a table dress of a montebank, to attract the attention of hjs :— although in vairi :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that if they were not seen ;— even her unimplemented impudence was flouted, and she left her field. But although the Cammon adullator cannot influence even the gourdine of his eyes, it is not that the female sex is indifferent to him: yet, it was an apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, still little knew that he was speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was that just even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by this apparently hatred of vice, he was also often among the women who formed the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, cls among those who usually by their apparatuses.\nAt about the same time, a young gentimon named Aubrey arrived in London: being an orphan left with one sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more false accusation of his friend to take care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination than his judgment. That is why he had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruined so many apprentices of a thousand thousand. He believed in sympathy with virtue, and thought that the vice was tbrown jri by Providence only for the images of the scene, as we see in the rannances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply by revealing clots, which were as hot, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various olorated patches. He says, in the figure, that the poet's dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, all the mothers subjugated him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or crawling favourites: the girls of the same time, their grinning faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merlt. Attached as he was to the romance of his salitary hours, he was scattered to find, lhat, except in tbc talk and candlcs of wax that freaked out, not from the presence of a ghost, but from lack of snuffing, there was no furnace in the real life for one of these assemblies of pissing pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, srom that he had formed his study. Discovering, above, a somcious compensation in his gratified vanity, it was lowered to bring down his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, crossed him in his caretaker.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few olfactory signs of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to their existence once, implied by the avoidance of the incontext: allowing his imagination to imagine all that fatterod is propensity your extravagant ideas, he soon forined lhisobject in the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before hlm. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and if the star moved on to his point of view, his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the preparation notes in — Street, he realized that he was full of courage to travel. Desirous of acquiring the computeristic family respocting this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to perfuse the tour, which for many generations a beeri thought did not need to enahle young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if hallen from the sky, whenever scondalous irilriges mentioned the subjects of pleasantry or os praises, cling to the degrek of competence chewn iri relating them to them. They slid; and Aubrey immediately became interested in Lord Ruthven, and was surprised to deny him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he readily accepted it, and a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, tall, though much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different consecutive patterns apparent to the conduct of this. His composition was abundant in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than in enough to satisfy their immediate needs. But Avbrey could not avoid romarrer, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the accompanying misforlunes even on uirtuc, that he breathed hjs aums ;-it was scint from the door with sneezes barely removed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve bis wants, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him still into his infinity, bc was sent away with rich charity. It was, no doubt, attributed by him to the greater importunity of the vicious, which generally predominates in the retirement of the virtuous needy. There were only circumstances about the charity of her Lordship, which was still more impressed on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because it was also either led to scaffolding, or sunk to the lowest and the most difficult misery. In Brussels and other countries through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companions sought the toes of all the fashionable vices; there he entered the whole spirit of the Faro table into the irito: he bet, and always spoiled with svcs, except where the known tbe more sharp was antagonistic hls, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met TBerosh young novice, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed the love of Fortuno — this apparent abstraction of the wos spirit set aside, and his eyes shone with morcque fire than that of the cat who dallying with half-morte moso. In each city, he left the old influent youth, torn from the circus which he worshipped, cursed, in the madness of the dungeon of cl, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this hell; while in any case a father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single piece of his immense wealth place, where to buy even sufficed to satisfy their preferred desire. You did not take money from the label garnbling; but immediately lost, in the roar of many, the last guilder that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the inrocent: it could but be the result of some damage of knowledge, which was not, however, able to combat the incoherence of the most experiential. Aubroy often wanted to represent him to his friend, and jostling him to resign that charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring him to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for the day he made his friend would give him the opportunity to speak freely and openly to him; however, this never happened. The Lord Rulhven in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke to him as his lip; and although Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, who ohtainod no greater gratification of her thari, the constant excitation of vainty wanting to bereclk this mystery, which to his oxidized magnaliori began the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a time, lost the sight of his companion; he threw him into daily attendance on the morbid circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, the letters orviated from England, which he operia with impatient avid; the first was torn his sisler, breathing riots but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter ostonna; if she had previously entered into irito his imagination that there was a power level resident in hif eompanion, these seemed to give bim suffician reasori for belief. His guardians insisted on his immediately leaving his friend, became excited, his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible power of the decision, made his licensorous habits more dangerous to society. It had been discovered that the bi-scorn for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to give his satisfaction, that his victim, the associate of the guilt of hjs, be driven out of the pinnacle of the unveiled virus, to the lowest abyss of the infomie and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently in account of their virtue, had, from bis sorbre, thrown even a tbe mask from the side, and had no scruples to expose all the desormity of their vicos to the public gaze.\nAubroy determined by leaving one, which character had not yet shown a light point finglc on which to refute the eye. He resolved to invent the possible prelet for a bandoning bim, to aim, in the sense, to monitor it more closely, and also did not let the circumstances of the fly without attention. He...\nIn the same circle, and soon perceived, his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met with the iri society, so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; Auhrey's eye followed him in all his hands, and soon discovered that an assignment had been appointed, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent girl, although there is nothing. Not losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, arid abruptly asked him his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the very hour that he was aware of his being about to meeting her that very right. The Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything was going to have on such an attack; and after having been precised if he tried to marry beer, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; and immediately wrote a note, los say, that from that moment on must be described accompanying his Lordship in the rest of the tour proposed, he ordered his servant to look for other opartments, and calling the mother of the lady, informed him of Oll hc knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also regarding the character of his Lordship. The assignment was made. The next day Lord Ruthven merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a seplation; but he did not cast doubt on his plans baving when thwarted by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed Peninsal, soon found himself at Athenf. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to trace the erased documents of ancient glory on the Tbat MONVEMENTS apparently, as bones chronicling acts of freedom only as slaves, had hidden themesselvos between sheltering soil or colorful rnany lehen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she formed the model for a painter relying on canvoss the promised shape of the faithful in the proradise of Mohammed, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she could belong to those who do not have souls. As she danced plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have expended his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this deluxe look asleep from the animal bulb adapted to the tasto of an epic. Aanthes walk was often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquitjes, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere uttersly, would show all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he had just dcypber on an effective tablet of almost, in the contemplation of his sylpha figure. Ofton wanted her braids to fall, while she was writing around, exhibiting in the ray of the sun such bright and quickly soothing shades, he might well excuse the oblivions of the antiquarian, which tore from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why try to describe charms that all feel, but no crook appreciate ?— He calls innovation, youth, and beauty, unaltered by overcrowded drawing-roads and stifling balls. If he drew the bones that he wanted to keep a memorial for his future executioners, she stood by, and looking at the magic effects of his pencil, in traoing the scenes of his native plocée; she would then describe him the dance encircled on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colors like the young renemory, the marriage pump that she remembered seeing in her childhood; and then, tuming to the subject who had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, would tell them all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her gains and her apparent belief of what she was telling, aroused the euen interest of A ubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vclmpyr, which had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the lily of a feincle limb to prolong her existence during the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her such idle and horrible fantasies; bvt Ianthe quoted at hjm the names of the old men, who had at 1st detected one living among them, aftormed several thoir near the relotters and children had been found marked with the buffer of the friend's appetite; and that he found it so new, she begged to believe her, for he had noticed that those who had dared their existence, had always had given evidence, which forced them, with grief and tear, to feel true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid her boundor was incrusted, hearing a fairly accurate description of Lord Ruthuon; he, h leader, still persisted iri persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocenco, so contrasted with all the virlues affected by the woman among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won hif heclrt; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man usually English, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he still found herself more attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for a clinticular rosary, he would leave, decided not to return until his abject was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention by the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Iantho was unconscious of his love, and was always the same unconscious Francoist he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but she was wrong because she no longer had someone with whom she had visited her fascist haunts, but her guardian was busy sketching or discovering the fragment of some that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vainpyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided that one of his cousins had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at night, as he must unconsciously pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the bad day closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the most heaviest evils as imminent at the top of the one who seized to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock himself in this way with a superior, iriferal power, whose very name had apparently frozen the blood of Tiger, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy force of his host, and was alarmed that the words hif, making the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them from such a terror. When he was about to leave, Kate Cane, on the side of his horse, and earnestly praying to return, the past night allowed the pagan of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy in his repulsiveness that he did not see that the light of the day was coming to an end, and that in the origin there, one of those which flies, in the warmer climates, assembled so quickly in a huge mass, and poured all their fury upon the devoted land .—He finally, However, riding his horse, discouraged himself from burning by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun fetes, the night begins: and he had already avoided away, the power of the storm was above — his thunders failed had barely an irilevai of rest — his thick heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall engulfed radiating his voric feet. Suddenly, his gaze was terrified, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the wide forest. The animal finally stopped, through the tired, and found, by the brilliance of lightning, that it was in the riverbourhood of a hole that barely rose from the masses of dead leaves and wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little more than one to guide towards the basn, or at the 1st is confident to get a shelter from the stork sting. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent mummcrit, prompted him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who was mingled with a choked and exulting mokerie of a laugh, continued in one unbroken human sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, ignited the door of the hut. He himself got himself full in the darkness: the sound, however, the guide. He was apparently unperceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and the radio noise was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone who seized themselves; when a man shook :\" Again bafsled !\" to whom he succeeded a great laugh; and feeling afflicted by an orian who seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but just was in vain: he was enumerated with his feet and shouted with enormous force ogainth the ground :— his enemy threw himself and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands on bis thr oats—when the brilliance of many torches penetrated through the hole that gave light in the hlm docly, disturbed ;— he instantly grated, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a mormer he crashed arms, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The slorm was still there; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soor heard by those who had everything. They entered, and the light of the torches fell upon the walls of the mud, and the thatched loaded ori every individual straw with flaks of beaked soft. At Aubrey's decision, she was searched for who had attracted him to his cries; he was left again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his headess brought into a course lifeless. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw Thesamo Sorin again, when he locked them up, lying at his side. There was no colour on his check, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as endearing as the life that lived there :—push his neck and chest were blood, and on his cup were the marks of the teeth of the half having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, at the same time, struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid by the table side of her who had already been for him the object of visions so bright and airy mary, now fallen with the flower of life who had died with her. He did not know what he was, his mind was inflamed and seemed to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a building parlicator, which had found in the hut. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lame forces, as they approached the city, announced the parents of some terribly astrophe. \"That would be impossible to describe this mourning; but when they were responsible for the death of the latter, they looked to Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey boing put to bed was seized of a violent mast fever, and wos often from Iirious; in these hc intervals would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Iclnthc — by an incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he would permeate the calculations on his head, and curse him like a beer destroyer. Lord Ruthven, charismatic at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, the crowned hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, arid because he has constant accompanying. When the latter recovered from his dolirium, he was horrified and amazed by the sight of him who had now combined his image with the ticket of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost coding for the fault that had broken the separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to the presence of his. His lordship seemed quite hanged; it no longer seemed that the apathelio being wbo had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his recovery began to be repatriated, he gradually withdrew the same state of mind, and very perceived no difference with the former man, except that he was surprised to move his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exvulsion playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the collapse of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook to observe the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these words, turning, like our world, the motionless sun ;— he objected to wishing to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the mind that once distinguished him so much, now seemed to run away forever. Today, there was as much solitvdo and silence as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished, the spirit bis could not find him in the nearby bound of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood next to half — if he sought him in the woods, his small step would appear moving in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violin; then suddenly turned around, showing, with wild imagination, his pale face on the wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which created so bitter bones in his mind. He prophesied to Lord Rulhven, that he held his sons by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, that they could have visited these parts of Riothin Greece seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for any place to which a memory could be attached; but if they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They bearded many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those those that they defended pretoned dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, once they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than doferice. When they entered, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large massifs of rock descended from the nearby precipices, they had a reason to repent of their neglect; for it was terrifyingly the whole. Do they go into the narrow neck, when they were surprised by the whistle of bolts near the head, and by the echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behind the rocks, bad started to turn in the direction when the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turri sheltering defilement: but ashamed to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shovts sade their advances, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if none of the should thieves climb up and take them to the rear, they decided to go there to rush into the scarf of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost the shell of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to help him; and, no longer listening to the contest or his own peril, he was quickly surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, thrown into his arms and submerged.\nBy the promise of a great reward, Aubrey industrialized them soon to lead his friend freed to an eabin of lie-voices; and having agreed to a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are correct simply to keep the entrance until their comrade has to come back with the sum promised, for whom he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength grew rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to accelerate. His conduct and enthusiasm had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the objects around him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eyes were often attached to Aubrey, who was led to offer help with more seriousness than usual –\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I harass the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you deny my horror, the horror of your friend. \"-\" How? \"I need a little cabin, I can explain the quire, but do you concacute me everything you know about me, my man was free of stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was unknown for a while in England, me, but life. \"-\"We don't know what the hall is. e :\"Swear !\" cried the dying man, who inflamed himself with exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your soul, by all your fears of nature, swearthal, a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, who may come, or whatever you may see .\" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" Aubrey said ,\" He sank laughing on his pillow, and he breathed no more .\"\nAubrey retired to rest, but did not sleep;\nThose attending his occupation with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath a cold camouflage on him, as is the presence of something horrible waiting for him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enlaid the hoof in which he had left the carp, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself and comrades, during his rot, to the top of a nigbbourante mountain, according to a promise that they had given to his lord, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Every afternoon, and took several of the men, dissuaded from going and cooking it in the place where it was. But, which he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of the corpse or clothes, the robbers swore that they had swept the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he returned to the least, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the score of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had mixed himself with such terrible misfortunes, and in which apparently aspired to raise this superstitious melanchoia who had seized his mind, he resolved to reach it, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, near to Napies, he took care to arrange the effects he had with him, joining Lord Ruthven. Among other things, it was a case of several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them around, and looking at curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently or named in the same style that was discovered in the fatal hut — he was shaking — which was intended to acquire a weapon, he found the weapon, and his horror could be imagined when he discovered that it was, in a way, equivalent to the scratch he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be related to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; given the particular shape, the same variety of tints upon the haft and moor were similar in the splendour on both, and did not leave space from afar; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, on his way home, in Rome, if the first investigations were about the lady who he had tried to remove seductive arts from Lord Steven. Her parsons were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard from the departmenturo of her secretary. Every mind was the most shattered in so many horrors; he feared that this lady had lost a life in the Manhattan destroyer. He became morose and silent; he took care of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dearly. Hc arrived at Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon bulwarked him on the shores of the English; and he hastened to the monsion of his satters, and Thero, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of this sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infernitine caresses, she had won her reward, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was still attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning the grade who won the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There was no slight thal shine that normally exists in the heated atmosphere of crowded apartment cells. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of misorturia, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indorulate a connoisseurous soul of a bitter kingdom. His step was not that light base, which spoke to me where using a buttersly or a color called a ttract — he was sedated and pensive. When alone, her face was never moved by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed from her Hisaffiliary, and could have forgotten her presence, those claws that she had kriew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuous? It seemed that these eyes, which were then played in the light of their own native speaker. Yet she only eightoen, arid had not been presented to the world. It was thought by his moro guardians that his presentation should be delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was therefore now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be at the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would prefer that Bove stay in the raintion of his fathers, and feed on melancholy which surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashion strangors, when his mind had seen 6 so torn up by the events he had seen; but he determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into the town, and prepared for the next day, which was atrocious as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing room had not been held for a long time, and also who were eager to rest in the kingship smile, hastened this one. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in that memory, the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this place, he felt himself suddained only by the arm, hanging a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that was bluffing him, when he was percised, at a little distance, the same character who had drawn the attention bis on the spot to his first entry into the into society. He almost took his weight, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and force a passage through the crowd, and threw himself in his car, and he returned home. And he passed over the room with the steps, and fastened his hands upon his head, because he feared that his thoughts might burst out of the hair brain. The Lord Ruthuen Agairi will prevail — the circumstances began in the dreadful array — the dagger — his oats. — He woke up, did not believe he could — the dead laugh again !— He thought his imagination had contributed to the image upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go again into socioly; for though he attempted to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in getting the information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. By leaving her outside the protection of a motor, he traced a corner, and there he gave himself to his own devourer. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another bimbotin, saved his sister surrounded by many, apparently in an energizing conversation; he began to pass by and approach the hor, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and in haste he forced her into the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and as he began to pass over, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :\"Remember your oath !\"He dared not turn, but, pressing upon his sister, came to him.\nThe Aubrey became almost dissident. If, before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now the certainty that the monster is again in a hurry over the high thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was to claim that she instructed him to explain to him that her child had caused her sudden drive. He only read a few words, and then terrified him. The more he thought about the inority he had. His oath surprised him ;— away. So he killed this monster so that he would wander, carry a ruin on his panties, against everything he held dear, and not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he wanted to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He bought to use his own barrid to free the world from such a misery; the bulbeath, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; he locked himself in his room, did not flee, and did not eat until his sister Camo, who, with his eyes flowing with tears full of spirit, prevented him, for his own good, from supporting the nature. Finally, he is no longer able to withstand the arid calm spirit, he leaves his house, gets bogged down in the street, anxious to steal the image that accompanied him. His dress was confused, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he came home with the evening; bvt al last, he laid a bim to rest wherever the fatigue exceeded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow the film; but they were soon disappointed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled with the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence was unconscious, he determined to enter society as an agairi, and looked at him closely, anxious to farewell, despite his oath, all those whom Lord Ruthveri approached with imitation. Even whori entered a roar, his haggard and his look suspicions were so intriguing, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that afflicted him so strangled. Wheri, however, the demonstration proved to be inavailable, the guards thought that the appropriate interface, and, pretending that the mind was alienating themselves, they thought that it was high time to resume that the trust that had been imposed on them by Aubrey parents.\nDesirovs of salvation from the wounds and sufferings that he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the genital eye, these marks of what they considered madness, they engaged a physiciari to refide in the house, and constantly take care of him. Hehcoldly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became great, he was confined to his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had tied a glass chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory left was played by himself in the writing of his sisler; then he would begin something, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that were gravely distressed, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Ob, don't touch him, is your love for me great, don't come near the bridge !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And once again, he sank into a state, from which she could never wake him up. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less freckled, and the mind has threw a part of its morosity, while bis guards observed, tumbling several times in the morning, he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to chat with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of the Auhreys situation being so terrible, while his sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Aubrey drew attention; he asked him with anxiety. Happy with this rotating intellect mark, of what he feared to have been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't grab each other, but by sewing for a few minutes, if the sister killed him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his lovely flow; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the idea of his brother being wetting more alive on the feelings of afsection. He began to splash with all his warmth, and to congratulate Ber on his marriage with a person so dislinguished for rarik and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, which was his surprise to behaling the eatings of the monster who had had if lang influenced his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus disinfected the relationship of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing his hands, and gazing on her with a frantic excrescence of countercris, he made swear that sbo would never marry this monster, so he — But he does not move forward, as if this voice agairi by bim remembered his oath, suddenly turns into a ravand, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near HLM but sees one no. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had bearded the whole, and bought that it was only a return of his disorientation, entered, and forced her to leave him. He fell on his knees, implored, he instructed them to delay, but for one day. They ostrating this to the madness they imagined having taken post --\nHe tried to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the Tobo Lounge, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he understood that he was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hidden from those among whom he had gained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and by the claim of great affection for Brother Tbe arid interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell: could it be expressed as an individual having no sympathy with any being on earth crowd, except with the one to whom he addressed himself ;— could he say how, sinco he knew hor, his existence, hcld bcgun ta secm worthy of conservation, if it was inexhaustible that he could just in his soothing accérits ;— in the end, he knew so well how the use of the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ), which was also to take place every day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, while left by the doctor and his guardians, hated the seruarits, but in vain. He whipped her with feathers and paper; she was given to her; he told his sister that he trusted her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own happiness, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, the delay but for a few hours the total marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but, giving him to the politician, he thought that it was better not to harass the dead Miss Aubreys spirit by, what he considered, the ravines of a mania. The night spent ori without rest for the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be more easily conceived, the notes of the occupied preparatian. Morning came, and the noise of the wagons broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiously the servant of the last overcome of vigilance, they gradually evaded, leaving him in the hecustody of the old hair woman powerless. He drunk the occasion, with a single woman tied out of the room, arid in a mountain found glossySi in the apartment where all carried almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached the sea, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the ocean, exclaiming with fury. When Lord Ruthuen murmured his ear on the stairs —\"Reminding your oath, and kriow, except for my fiancee on a day-to-day basis, Your Fister is disgraced. Women are fragile !\" Thus, which pushed him to his landers, who, awakened by the old woman, had come into the sea of him. Aubrey could support himself longer; his not history found the wind, had broken a hood-vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not begged to his sister, who was not there when he entered, as the physician feared shaking him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride was married from left London.\nAbbreyfs weakness has increased; the outpouring of blood-produced symptoms has occurred near the onset of death. He was looking for the guards of his fissier could be called, and when midnight had struck, he resumed the hunt composed the convinced hcls reader, he died immediately after.\nThe guards hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but that they arrived was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, the arid sister of Abrey had been thirsty for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nTHE BYRON SIGNER RESIDENCE AGREEMENT, etc.\n\"The world stands before it, where to choose its place of rest, and Providence is its guide .\"\nEN Sailing through the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we pull into the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. To the beauty of this place, and to the eastern supply of cattle and vegetables always to be had there, to induce in any British ship to visit — both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums refund amply for the deviation of a language. We landed, like usual, at bootroom bone, the boy, and while the men were working in watering, and the bargaining handbag for cattle with the natives, clergy and mysels took a ramble at the Oove called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the flow of Mount Ida (a small mound for nomed) we met and hired a Greek word as our guide, who told us that he had come from Sclo with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \" He hired me as a pilot, did the Greek, and took me to a spiritual hive; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a strange man, a very good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left the old ari man in the charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins for it ,( about L 250 French English ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis story excited our curiosity very much, and we didn't waste time hastening into the house where our runryman had resided. We were kindly received by an old husband, who took us over the hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marble tables on each side, a large rectangle in the central, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, arid an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, using two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. Iri, the living room we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large box of scams in the closet: it was open, but we did not think the justified covers in the examination of the containers. On the painting of the recreation of Vollaircs, Sbakspeares, Bileaus, and Rousseau complete works; the ruins of Einpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzehues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton's Paradise Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Conslantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with notes of margol, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched all over them, and marked with slips of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old salda man :\"The lord had read books of these in the evening before he splashed, and forgolent to put himself with the others; hut ,\" he said ,\" They must go back to it well until bis; for it is so particular, that if I move a thing without anything, it would frown on me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I have done him a favor; I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except the zechins of twerity which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small oottage in the vagrant, and which the Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do know what they do .\"\nThe operation of the outer house was pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen braads, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in the Greek architect ), were considerably higher than the roof. The rupee, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a thin turkey carpet, under a strong awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, bone on them, the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, drinking Iight wines, such as \"lacbryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left-hand hare, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens that were assembled on its borders, under the shadow of two beds of large bluertle, a marble seat with anornamonal wooden waf placed, on what we had been told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I get angry\" said the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very fervent ,\" and always tied up our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird eye v view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and nature in bloom, and to the top of it, where an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stretchlm from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as glass, and a colourless horizon with a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a lilte on the left, through a view of lofty chesn ut and palm trees, several islands of salt were observed in a distinct way, spreading the blue light waveo with spots of emerald green. I rarely had a sight more than she did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who lived in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name except Domiriick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Thc Armerian,\" said our conductor ,\"but I am not sure which,\" and can you tell me, old friends?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not. We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details in the name of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the normal feast. He gave a cow to a man, borses to others, and cotton and bacon to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to vs, of all that we called, to be a very eccentric and benevolent character. One circumstance that we have learned, that our old friend at the cottage tangt owns not to disclosc. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was after seeing the wall king from the shore of the sea, and he had bought his apiano-fart, and taught him the books of him.\nThis was the information with whom that we left from Mitylenc's peaceful issue; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all these secce-\nThings that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. A company of iri in decline with Mr. FOSTER, architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece.\n\"The individual,\" he said ,\" who you are so atrocious about is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we were a few years agony; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the account of Clacla on each page. Deeply, we were not more curious about our research at the cottage, but we came together with the idea of retuming at Mitylene or one day running away; but at that day never returned. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, arid in justice in the good name of his seigneury, which a beer grossly slandered. It has been described as a problem.\nDisposition of eel, shower, look associating with human pearly, or contriving in any way to soften his monks, or add to his pleasures. The first just directly upside down, as a way to be clearly collected from these anecdotes of a lilt. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his position. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all the actions of faith; and its drying up of the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark it as a being upon whose heart, the Religion Halh sealed, and our whose head Volunteer bath bear coat. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" of pre-edition without boasting of being proud of him as a countryman. As far as his love or his pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right of giving an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and both who dares to justify bimsels before this terrible court which all must appear, only can censor the errors of a fallowmortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. For the good in secret, and when the applause of the world, is the surest testiony bone, a virtuous heart and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Prince, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "26": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE supremacy on which this story is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, it did not extend to Greek after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of Latin and Greek churches; to which time, the idea being predominant, that a body of Laljn could not corrupt of bried on their territory, it gradually unshake itself, and formed the subject of many stories of wonderful, still existing, of the dead rising from their graces, and feigning on the blood of young people and beautusul. In the West, it spread, with variations of gold, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where belief exists, that the vampyres were damaging some of the blood of the victims, who mingled, lost their strength, and died quickly of consumpti ions; they wept the suckers of human blood, and their vcins became destabilized with such a slate of repletion, to cause blood to flow in all passages of their body, and even from very porous tbc of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious, and, of course, credible, account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreygo, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that, about five years earlier, a cortain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been horded to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a uampyre, but had found a way to rid him of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of Tobe Comppyre, rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, not prevented him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his arid burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had seen deprived of life by his atlases. To prevent other malices, the inhabitants consulted Ir Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as is supposed to ho usual in the ccls of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free from corruption, and emit al the mulhlnosc, and ears, pure blood and florid. The evidence was thus obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A pole was completely divorcing Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he turned back from being so terribly scared as if he had been alive. That's what they did, they put his pearl, put his body, and dragged the case into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of people who had died before the death of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents rising on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person sucked by a hammer becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, as it seems better suited to the object of the present observations than any other invention that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it was considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime coincided when it existed, that the deceased not only mingled with vampyria, but forced to limit infernal visits to the only theosic beings he loved the highest of the earth, that he was bound by ties of kindness and affection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, after Vampyre sent, Your Corsica will fraternize its tomb, then it will haunt the place of the district, and it will suck the blood of all your seed; from there your daughter, sisler, wife, During the night drain the flow of life; Yel will plunder the banquet that is to feed your livid corsus living, Your victims, have yet come to an end, They will know the devil Sher beir sire; As you curse yourself, You will covet them, Your flowers are wilting in the stomach. But the order that for your fall of romance, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your clock and mark the last cloth of his cheek: the spark of his eye, and the glazed look that freezes, is lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, will tear the braids of his yellow bair, Os which, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — but the riow is broken from you by the Memorial of your agony! But with your best blood will flow; your grinning tooth and your sloppy lip; then tracking down to your sulten tomb, Go-clend with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these iri borror gets away from the cursed specter than they do.\nSouthey presented also in his wild poem but beautiful of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having turned the grava fram in order to torment him, she loved better whllst in existence. But this cannot be supposed to have reappeared from the sin of his life, it has been spilled throughout the tale as a complete type of purity and innocenco. Tho veracious Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of astonishing sevoles cases of vampyrisrn, to that he claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmel, in bis great work on the fubject thys, in addition to a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional tales ilustralive of the effects, put far some distortions learned, tending to prove it to be a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, clrid which now has no idea to be concuded by simply romarking, that the word vampyre is that in the most general acoeptation, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of in different parts of the world: like Vravcol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the stunning dissipations over a London winter, there appeared to the wretched parties of the leaders of the Tori, a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, that this rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention, which he could by a glance stifle left, and throw the Sear into the breasts where carelessness risen. They felt this sensation of awe, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead eye of moaning, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through inside the work of the ear; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every dung; all wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never won a war, elther of the blusb of the rnodosity, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her forrn and its contours were beautiful, many of the feole hunters tried to wear her waits, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been inockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything except put in the robe of a mountainbank, to attract his attention :— but in vain :— when he stood up, though his eyes were apparently fixed on her, although he came out as if they were not hit ;— even her unapplaused impudene was flouted, and she left the field. But even if the common advertisement could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which that he spoke to the virtuous woman about the innocent girl, that few knew that he never addressed women. Hc had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if he himself was totally exacerbating the fear of his singular character, or they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtue, as among those who voices by their.\nAt about the same time, he was a young Gelleman by the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of hail, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left the alfalfa to himself by guardians, who thought it was their responsibility simply to look after his fortune, while they took over the more important charge of his sub-alterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high Romanic feeling of hoover arid cancer, which daily ruins so many inilliners' appreritics. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that voice was swallowed up by Providence simply by taking on the crevices of the infection of the scene, as we see in the aromas: to be thought that the misery of a house was content with coriander in the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he was interested in gay environments, the married mothers surrounded him, trying to deseribor with the least lruth their languishing or grumpy favorites: the girls at the same time, by the brilliant faces when he approaches, waved by the sparkling eyes bitter, when we wipe his lips, foon led him into false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his solitaires, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and the wax candles which figged, rioting from the presentoo of a ghost, but in the absence of snvffing, there was not a foundry in real life for none of the thal congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to return to his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of sleeping an idea of a man stutter enlivened in himself, wbogave few other signs of his observation of external objects, then dried him from tacil to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: to allow Jing his imagination to picture something euery that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he quickly formed this object in the horo of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person bent before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far he has endured his riot, that his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, the client said that Lord Ruthvens fairs were embarrassed, and soon found, from a few notes of preparation in — Street, that it was on the point of travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to perform the tour, which for many generalization was considered necessary to allow young people to launder a few quick steps in the civil career towards getting equal with the old people, and not to let them appear as fallen from fires, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as the subjections of pleasure or as praise, according to the degree of skill that one is wearing. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoked his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of HLM, which, little by little, had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it glodically, arid in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nNeither, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthvens character, and now we find him, that, although his actions more daredly were exploded from his point of view, the restlands offered different conclusions of the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate wankers. But Aubrey not avoids pointing out, that he was riat on the vrtuous, reduced to indigence by misfortunes even attended on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask something, not to relieve hls wants, but to grant him to wallow himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charlty. It was, arbitrated, attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the indigent virtues. There was a circumstance that escaped the charity of his Lordship, who was more impressed by his spirit: all the ones that he was granted, inevidently found that there was a curse on him, because they were all led to. the scafsold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities, he passed, Avbrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the censors of all the fashjonable uice; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: hc bet, and always played with the eagerness, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and he lost even more than he won; but it was still the same immutable sace, with which hc gazed at the saciété around: it was not, however, when the young full novice eruption was encouraged, or lhc father without chance of a great family; then his wisb seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of mirid was set aside, and if the eyes struggled with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the mouse halfmort. In each reason, he raises the youth formerly trifle, torn from the circle which he has adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; wbilst much a father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. You do not look at the money of the table of play; but immediately the last, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he has just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bull being the result of a degree of certainty of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the cvning of the more experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged HLM to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for the day of the catch, he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly; however, it happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, arid in the midst of the various wild scenes and ricb of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of just than the confidant oxeitement of finally wisbing to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a timo local vision of his companion; he left him waiting daily in the morning circle of an Italian country, where he went in search of the memories of another city almost deserted. While he was committing himself in this way, the letters dreaded from England, which he opened impatiently; the first was from his sister, breathing nothing but the afsection; the others were of his guardians, the latter surprised him; if she had already entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to waste him the reason sufficient sar belief. His guards insisted that his friend, and urged, immediately leave his character, be terribly curious, so that the position of irresistible power of seduction makes his licentious habits more dangerous to silk. It had been discovered that the contempt for adultery had not been caused by a halorous character of Hcr; but this bo had required, for his gratification, that his victim, the father of his guilt, be heard of the pinacle of unwelded virtue, at the rise of the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females whom he sought, apparent because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even lhrown the mask set aside, and had not scrambled to expose the difference of this kind of thing to the public goose.\nAubrey torpedoed upon leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which the eye roams. He tried again to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, by seeking, in the sense, to touch him more closely, and not to let him pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon understood that his leadership was trying to train the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose house he had mostly frequented. In Italy, it was rarely that a single woman was met with society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but every eye followed in all its windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been matched, which would probably end in the ruin of a harmless girl, albeit without thought. Not wasting time, being in Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked him for his intentions with regard to the child, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were blurred, as he believed, and that he was content to laugh when asked if we wanted to marry him. Aubrey replied; he attached himself, immediately writing a note, to say that from that moment on he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their extended visit, to be odorod his servant to seek other opartments, and calling the mother of the lady, informed him of the hell that he knew, rioting only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day, Lord Steven contented himself with his servant's notification of his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suggest that there was no suspicion of his plans being violated by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his stopovers to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon occupied himself by tracing the erased records of the ancient glory upon monuments which, apparently, had hidden under the veil of shelter or many colored lichens, as if it were a matter of rubbing the acts of free men only before slaves. Urider the same roof as Helf, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could hue for ined the model for a pajnler wisbing to pavrtray on canvases the promised hope of faithful lbc in the paradise of Mahoommet, except that her eyes go too much rind for any orian to think that she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle and poor type of her consciousness.\nFor whom would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of an angry nature, for this sleepy look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an elapse. Anthony light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, often attaching to the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of her farm, floating as just were on the wind, looking at herself greedy, who forgot the otters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased lahlet, in contemplation of his figurc sylph. Often, her braids would fall, as she flirted around, exhibiting in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly erased from the hues, he might well excuse the forgnitude of the antiquarian, who let escape from her mind the object even that he had before thought of vital importance to the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why describe the charms that everyone feels, but no cari appreciates ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing sounds and stifling balloons. As he drew the remains which he mocked to protect a memorial for his suture hours, she stood by, on the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the bones of his place of origin; she then described him the circular dance on the open peain, extended to him, in the brilliant collars of the youthful memory, the marriage pump which she remembered to have looked at in his infarction; and then, turning to subjects which had been evidently made a great impression on his mind, told him all the penal stuff of his nurse. Her sincerity is attached to what she tells, excites the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampyre, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the bewitching morigues, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at the sucbois and harpy fclritases; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had at last detected a living between them, after the seueral of their relatives relatives and childreri had been found marked with the stamp of the friend appctite; and when she found such unbelievable, she begged him to believe her, for he had noticed that those who had doubted to question their existence, had always had some proof. He forced them, with sorrow and tears, to confide what was true. She detailed him the trophic operation of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, haunting a rather precise description of Lord Rulhven; however, he persisted on persuading her, that he could not truth in his fears. At the same time, he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Iarithe; his innocence, so controduced with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought a hif vision of romance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a uried Greek girl, still he was more and more attached to the almost fairy-like form that he preceded. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for the same antiquarian search, he did so, delermining not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention up the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept an image quickly alone the arrogant possessor of thoughts. Anthony was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always fled from him with reluctance; but it was the cause sbe no longer had anyone with whom the sbe could visit a hor favorite haunted, while his gvardian was occupied in sketoohing or uncoveringsome fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time again. She wrongly appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and the two, with several parents, affirmed their existence, pale with horror to the drama itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey seized one of the exhortations that had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they immediately begged him not to turn at night, because he had to go through a wood, that no Greek would ever be certain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration. They dethroned it as the resort of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of the representations, and tried to laugh them outside of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring class to mock a fuperior, the indirect power, whose very narne apparently made their blood freeze, he was his own.\nNext morning, Aubrey put osf on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obfer the melancholy face of his host, and worried lofind his words, mocking the bolief of these horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to deport, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and begged eminently to return, and the night diminished the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. It was, however, so busy in its research, that they did not perceive that the daylight would end so, and that on the horizon there, with one of those spots which, in warmer climates, so quickly gather a huge mass of irito, and pour all the fury upon the devoted land .—He finally, bowler, mounted his horse, dtormined to compensate by the speed of his delay: but it was too late. In the so southern climates, just almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and there had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its thunders of ecbolrig had a little of an interval of results, heavy groove forced the way through the canoeing falching, while the forchu blue Iightring seemed to fall and radiate to its very effect. Suddenly, his horse looks scared, and is carried with a terrible speed in the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped by the fatigue, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a coffin that rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Demonstrating, he appropriated himself to sin some oria to guide him to the city, or at least relying on the help of the storm's eruption. As they approached, the thunder, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman mixing himself with the suffocated laughter, exulting laughter, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised: hut, agitated by the thunder, which rolled on his heel, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. So in total darkness: a smile, however, guided a hair. He was apparently unporced; for, although he called, the sounds were still sounded, and nothing was taken from him. He found himself with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out ,\"Agairi turned!\" And he felt himself assailed by an angel whose strength seemed superhuman: wet to sell his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; he fought in vain; he rose up from his feet, and cast strength against the ground; his enemy cast him upon him, and burned himself on his throat; and when he dazzled with many torches that entered into the hole that gave the light of the day, he disturbed him; he rose up instantly, and left the prey bis, he rushed through the door, and sat down in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, and was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by this without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble straw spread over each straw with a heavy soft flake. To Aubrey's desire, she was sought who attracted him by his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torohes once more burst upwardson, to perceive the aerial form of his concert failure brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that he wos but an arisiring vision of his disturbed imagination; bvt he gained the form of shame, that he uncloses them, stretched by his side. There was no color on his cheek, not even on his lip; however, there was a silence enveloping his face that seemed as attached as the wife who used to live there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth that had bloodshed the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, struck at the same time as the horror ,\" In Vampyre! A Company !\" A little was quickly formed, the cold Aubrey was placed next to her who had been for him the object of so much bright and fairies versions, now fallen with the os lisée de fleur which badly died in her. He did not know what his purchases were, his mind was snoring and seemed to flout the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in the hand, thus a bare dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of his wbom a malchr had missed. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, announced the parties of the same terrible catastropho. \" It would be impossible to endure grief; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were unconscionable; both died in the heart of broken.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent monster, and was often delirlous; in intervals he would call Lord Ruthven arid on Iantho — by an incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being that he had loved. To others, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed the ham as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from whatever motive, hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant companion. When he returned from his delirium, he was horrified by the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Ruthven, by his kind words, almost pleaded repentance for the fact that had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. Hls seigneurie vuined completely changed; it seemed only the apathetic being that bad so astonished Aubrey; but also soon that his convalescence began to be fast, he ogain gradually withdraws irito the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived rio difference of the former man, except that other times he was taken to meet his gaze fixed intently on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted her. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven undertook in an apprehensive manner to observe the waves without tides and the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs,circling, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to strive to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrecy, by this shock, was much weakened, and the thal elasticity of mind that had once so distinguished him riow seemed to have a luge forever. Today he was as fond of loneliness and silerie as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his spirit could not plunge him into the vicinity of Athens; if he sought to engulf him in the woods, his light step would become bogged down in the middle of Tbe underwood, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly he turned, to his imagination, his palo fao and his wounded throat, with o meek smiled upan his lips. He decided to steal scenes, every which seam created bitter associations in his mind. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by his tender care, that he had taken of him during his illness, that they were filling the parts of Greece, and that he had not seen. They traveled in each direction, and looked for all the places where a recolleotiori could be attached; but although they hadtened so from place to place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which, according to the theories, were only the invention of individuals, who were interested in the generosity of those whom they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of this neglect, the advice of the inhibitors, they traveled once with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than delayed. Upon entering, bow, a narrow defilement, set the beat of which was the bcd of a torrent, with great masses of rocks brings down the neighbouring precipices, they bad reason to repent of their neglect; for there was not all the parties engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistleling of the closed bullets at their head, and by the report echo of Severai rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, the child began to shoot in the direction when the game came. Lard Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their oxample, withdrew for a moment are protected from defilement: but shameful of being shot down by a fae, who, with insulting cries, shouted at them, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, all the thieves should climb up and take them to the back, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. Hardly had they lost the shape of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received the shot cl in the shovlder, which brandished him to be ground. Aubrey besieged himself to his donkey; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him – his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately thrown over their arms and surrendered.\nWith promises of a great reward, Aubroy soon Jnducha opened his wounded friend in a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no more troubled by their presence, being simply told to keep the entrance until their eoinrade returned with the sum promised, for which he had the order. Lord Ruthvens strength was rapidly reduced; in two days death was inflamed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct had not changed his appearance; he seemed as insensitive to the pain that he had been talking about him; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became obviously uncomfortable, and his eye fixed to Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with the usual serious moro that –\" See me! You only save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life. I listened to the death of existence iny as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, your friend's honor. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need a little lilt, my life flourishes, I cannot explain everything, but if you hide everything you hide, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death had been known for some time in England, me, but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exulsive violence ,\"Swear by all your soul that, by your nature, you swear that for a year you will not give your know-how of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whether it occurs or what you will see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ridiculed himself on his pillow, and he did not burn any more.\nAubrey rested, but fell asleep in the riot; the many circumstances which accused him of knowing this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his goal, an earthquake came upon him, as if from the presentation something horrific was waiting for him. He got up early in the morning, he talked about eriting him the hole in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and eomrades, at his retreat, to the pinccle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise he had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the cold ray first of the moori who lifted his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took several of the men, determined to bury him in the place where he was. But when he laughed at him, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the robbers swore that the identity 1 stone on which they had laid the body. For a long time, his mind was perplexed in his conjectures, but he finally came back, even asked that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of an country iri which he had encountered in the mind of such calamities earth, and where all apparently conspired to raise superftilious that mlancholy who had settled on his mind, he resolved to leave you, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Olranto, or to Naples, he occupied him with the organization of these desserts which he kissed with him, which extended to Lord Robert. Among other things, there was an ease of containing several crime weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. Wilft turning them, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise to find a sheath apparently decorated in the same bone style, the dagger discovered in the hut of fatal — he shuddered-hasteri to gain more proof, to be found the weapon, and his terminal can he imagine when he discovered that he did, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for further certainty: they sowed their eyes to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the parlicular form, the same varying shades on the shaft and fheath were similar in splendor in both, and left no room for doubt; here were the alfo drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and when he returned to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had tried to practice in the seductive arts of Lord Ruthuen. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and it has not been heard since the break of the seigneary bis. Aubrey's mind became almost brokered over so many repeated horrors; it was conjured that the lady this had fallen a victim to the desert royyer of Ian the. He became morose and silent; and his only occupant was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the ghost's life that he held dear. He came to Calais; a break, which began to obey his will, soon set him on the shores of the English; and he hastened to his father's house, and there, for a while, began to lose, in the merchandise and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If, by her infantile caresses, she had spoiled her affection, now that the Bogan woman appeared, she was still attached as a companion.\nMiss Avbrey didn't have that grinning grace that won the gauze and applause from the salon assemblies. There was no such brilliant light that exists only the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the softness of the mind below. There was a melancholy charism about this which not seemed to come from the misfortune, but from a certain foal inside, which seemed to indicate a soul capable of a brighter role. His step was not only the light foot, which wandering where to wear a butterfly or a color can attract — it was sedate and pensivo. When Alono, her face was devoured by the smile of joy; but when Berfrère breathed her affection, and in her presence inflamed her sorrows which she knew destroyed the rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of voluptuous tho? It seemed that these eyes — this face was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and she had not been brought to the world, because you had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation had to be diverted until her brother returned from the infectiousness that he could be her protector. It is now, in this case, a place where the next living room, which was approaching quickly, was to be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the father's house, and fed melancholy that invaded him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own consolation to the protection of sister bis. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe storm was excessive — a drawer-room had not been held so long, and all those who were anxious to block the kingly smile, hastened the thithor. Aubrey was there with her sister. Standing in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, he committed himself to the memory of the first lime he had seen in Lord Ruthvens place, and suddenly felt seized by his arm, and a voice herccognized too well, sounded in his ear ,\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn around, eager to see the spectrum that would explode a bim, when he perceived, a little distance, the same singer that drew his attention to this place when he entered the silky shirt. He looked at his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and bewitching a passage through the crowd, he threw the light into his car, which was set in motion at home. He grabbed the space as he rushed, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would faint from his brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him — the circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up himself, he could not believe it possible — death went up !— He thought his imagination had corrected the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — determined over there-\nTo return to the priesthood, for he hastened back about Lord Ruthven, the name hurig on his lips, and he did not seize the information. He wrote a few nights later with his sister at the convention of a nuclear relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he rotted in a recreation, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Porceiving, at last, many were leaving, he woke up, and entering another room, found sister bis surrounded by several, apparently in a deserved conversation; he tried to pass and get her neck, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those characteristics that he had the most horror. He pushed her to the street; at the door, he found her flocked by the crowd of fogs waiting for their lords; and he undertook to bend them again with the beard, the voice whispered near him —\"Remove your oath !\" — He dared not to turn around, but, pressed his locksmith, he quickly reached Hame.\nAubrey became a distracted alienate. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was engrated, now that the monster's certainty has once again pressed on the high thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated him to explain to him what had led to her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who roasted it. The more he bought, the more perplexed he was the mare. His coach surprised him ;— was he there to let this monster wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, against all that he held dear, and not avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But if he were your black his oath, and closing his decisions, what would force him? He thought he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for the sake of the space here, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear skills and loneliness, he left his dung, wandering from the street to the street, anxious to steal this irritating which disturbed him. His become dressed neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; at first he returned to the house, and at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who was feeling a fast pursuer than any other thought-froing. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Sluck with the idea that he left behind by the absence of all his friends, with a friend omon gst, whose prefence they were unconsciousous, he decided to enter society again, and court him closely, anxious verantly, despite the oath bis, all that Lord Ruthven tamed with intimacy. But when he entered the room of the planet, his distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner wilts were so visible, that his sister lost herself to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that strongly engulfed him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought to interfere and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, thought that it was a high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them by the parents of Aubrey.\nDesirous of erasing the hell of wounds and sufferings being had daily methods in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered madness, they engaged a doctor to the resident in the house, and constantly taking care of him. He did not like to notice him, his complete mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His inconsistency was so great that he was confined to his chamber. There, he often lied for a day, unable to be woken. He had been moved, his eyes had reached a glassfric chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and re-collection that remained appeared above his sister's training; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that afflicted him, he would dissipate her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" Where, however, asked whom he referred to, his only answer was :\"True! True !\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and bis rennided part of its gloom, while its guardian observed that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of her guardians entering the room, began to confuse with bis physiclan on this melancboly eircumstance of Beirig Dubrey in such a horrible situation, when her sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this internet return mark, if they feared that he would be private, they instigated Marsderi Earls name. He was a young count whom he had met in society. They seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention of the presence of the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the idea that his bra was once more likely to his feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to corigratulate it on the ber marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and the accomplishment every; when to be suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, which was his surprise to consider the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under his feet. On his hiin ringing why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then capturing her groups, and looking at her with a frantic explosion of counting, he badcber swearing that she would never marry that snoring, for he — but he could not hold on — it seemed that if this voice repeated to him remember his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was a return to his disorder, enter...\nAnd Miss Aubreys forceful, wanted his to leave. He sells them on his knees, he pleads, begs them to delay them, but for one day. They, attributing this to the madness, they imagined having taken possession of his spirit, a clever to polite him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthveri had called the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. Where he heard of Aubreys ill health, he easily understands himself to be the cause; but when he let go that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be realized from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened in advance of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great effect for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, unless he could hear it to whom he addressed him ;— could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if he were only that that he would listen to the soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how the art of the serpent, or sucb was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The Tbc title of the older branch fell to him in length, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the content.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardian, tried to bribe the servants, but in voicing. He asked for a pen and paper; it was the given; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated happiness, her honor, and the good of those who are now in the grave, who have welded their arms as their hope and the hope of the house, to sleep, but for a second hour this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would dilute it; but, giving it to the doctor, he bet it that not harassing Miss Aubreys miride any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without the rest of the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that much more easily be conceived as described, the notes of occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the noise of the locks broke a big error. Aubroy grew up in a frantic almost. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, gradually moving away, leaving them in the custody of the powerless old woman. He besieged himself to the opportunity, with a tie was out of the room, arid in a moment was found in the apart table where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri sees him first: he approaches immediately, and, taking his arm by force, precipitates him from the room, sorrow without a voice. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered his ear —\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée day by day, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" He pushed him to his coaches, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in the service of him. Aubrey could rio more to support him if his rage did not sound the wind, had broken a vase of blood, and he was transported to bed. It was not mentioned his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the politician was afraid to stir it. The wedding was solenized, and they married and married left London.\nAuhreys weakness increased; blood efficiency produced this symloms near the teeth. He wanted the guards of his sister might be called, and when the hour of the night struck, he described in a composite way that the reader persisted — he died immediately after.\nThe guardians bastenod to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Rulhven had disapproved, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nOn board one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we put in the port of Mitylenc, on the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found there, iridulate many British ships to visit it, both men of war and the merchants; and rather shake him off the path for the sbips linked to Smyma, his obsessions to repay for the deviation of a vayago. We disembarked; as a visual, at the bottom of the bay, arid while the men were working on watering, and the handbag trading for cattle with the shipwrecked, lho clorgyman and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, arid other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small nominated mound) we met and changed a young Greek like our guidance, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the jsland four days before at ovarrival in his felucca. \"He hired me like a plol ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am like one to marry. He was weird, but a very good man. The house on the hill of Tbe, facing the river, belongs to him, and he lows left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the wine-troder, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English Agency ,) and low resided there for about four months, though not constantly; for he slashes his felucca very often to the various islands .\"\nThis account excited our curiosity very much, and we did not waste any time having the house where our compatriot had resided. We were graciously received by an old man, who led us to the mansjon. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, a training room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: green valleys, marble tabs on either side, a myrtle largo in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branohes by moving a fixed source on the side of a small bronze Venus in a learning posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the fur. In the lobby, half a dozen engineers...\ncane chairs, legs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a silvicultural painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two dry plush duvets a plough — the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we offered a marble niche. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large chest of Seanan on the fence: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the contents of lunch. On the tablet, the corners of Voltaire, Shclk Speare, Boileclu and Rousseau are finished; the Rvins of Einpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the messjah of Kotzebue riovels; the game of the Robbers of Schiller; Paradjse Lost of Millon, an Italian edition, presented in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constanlinople, much torri, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Italian. The Messich was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which also were remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had been reading and reading these books before sailing, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, it is necessary to lie there until his return; for it is so special, that if I were to move something without order, he would frown me for a hesitation together; it is very good elsewhere. I did him a favor one day, and I find it very difficult to take care of it, except for twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who is redone in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought from Adrianople; I do not know why.\nThe appearance of the house was externally pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars fluted with black pillars and fret work cornices (as it is now temporary in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher roof of lhari. The roof, overwhelmed by a blanket of light moons, was separated by a thin, boned turkey carpet with a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus filled, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a little strcamlet glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evening and next till twelve hours, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man, praying ,\"for he was very fervent, and always attended the church of the over twice for a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colela, surrounded by olive trees and myrties in 6 loom, and ori the symbol whose ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea beats in glass, and on thehorizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, small islands several were distinctly observed, spreading the blue wavelight with lots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his man, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"has known you, but I am sure there will be riots,\" and can you say, my friend? \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We did not have the time of visiting the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several particulars of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was the last one on the top of the island, and even danced with them at the rival party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, said he gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed vs, of all that we understood, also was a very occentric loving ordinal character. A circumstance that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage thought not to reveal. He had the most beautiful donut, with which the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and had taught him the use of himself.\nThis was the information with which that we left from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all or the rack, guessing what rowing to Greece could be him. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Folliring in the company of Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I struck him on my journeys or the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of his leadership, as we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harolde\" being put in the hands of over recryized this recluse of Calcla iri every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious about our cattery research, but we have been confused by the idea of returning to Mitylene on a futuro day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court if the good name of Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. He has been dismayed as an inconsiderate disposition, opposed to the association with human nature, or contributing arduously to appease his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be collected from such small anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so gloriously depressed in his secondary poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tonderries, sympathies, and charity appear to guide all his actions; and he courtes the rest of the solitudes carry additional reason to mark him as a being on whose heart religion sealed his, and on whose head Benevolenco half threw his coat. Noman Cari has read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With regard to his love or pleasures, I have no right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received completely, especially when they are directed against the morals of a man; and whoever dares to justify his words is a court where everything must appear, only merely censors the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of virtuous beauty and self-approval consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown-court, Fleet-Street.",
    "27": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superimposition on this tale is very general to the East. Among these Arabians opposes being a comman: it does, however, extend to the Greeks only after the establishment of Christianity; and it has assumed their present form only since the division of the Latin churches and groups; to which limousine, the dominant idea becoming, that a Latin body could not be extinguished if it was buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many stories astonished, externally, from the dead rising from the tombs of their, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Australia, and Lor rajno, where the belief exclaimed, the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims, which became emclciatod, perstbeir strength, and quickly dictated consumption; while these human wood suckers were weakening — and their veins bocamed to such a state of reconstitution, as to cause the blood of all the posames of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, March ,1732, is a curial, and, of the bear, a crcdiblereport of a particular casc of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, they asserted positively and unwaveringly, that about five years earlier, a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, had heard to say that, in Cassova, on the border of the Servia Tu rkish, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had four times a way to get rid of evil, eliminating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyc, and rubbing herself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from pretending to be a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and brain, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been devoured from life by his attacks. To sow even more harm, the inhablants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrifm) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, over and froze blood. The evidence thus obtained the beer, they resorted to the remedy accident. A stroke was driven entirely into the heart and the body of Arnold Paul, where it is reported to Havo also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The sarnois measures were adopted with the curses of these Persians who had died before of capitalism, for fear that they would become, in their turn, agents of others who had been able to control the\nI lived with them.\nThe uriversal belief is that a person pursued by a vampire becomes a hammer himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief ,6 usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it adapts better to the current situation than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a heinous crime was committed while it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrif, but forced to consect his infernal victuations only to those beings that they loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes to the expression \"Gi aour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent it, Your course shall be torn from his tomb; Tben shall flout ghastly tho nalive place, And suck the blood of every race Ly; There of your daughter, sister, wife, Towards midnight drains the current of life; And yet hate the banquet which must feed your living corsus, Your uictims, Ero they expire, They shall know the devil for their sire; As cursed theo, Thou cursed the hem, The flows are inlaid upon the stem. But only that for your crime must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a fat one — That word will wrap your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the timidity of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last muselle view of a glassy look that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without Halloween, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when one wore the tenderest plodge of affection — but now is neo-neo far from your Memorial of your agony! But with your own bestblood drop; your grinning tooth, and the hook blade; then harassing your sullen bove, Ga—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror distance themselves from the spectre tighter than they.\nMr. Southey also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thaloba\", the corso vampire of the good Arab Oneiza, who was represented as having returned from the grava in order to torment him. She loved better when she was in existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, being rottrayod blurs the whole of history as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tho veracious Tourriefort gives a long account in his travels of several cases of slashing of vampyism, so that he claims to have an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, put forward some learned dissertators, tending to prove that he is a classic, like a world of bargain error.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limitations of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simply cracking, that although the term Vampyre is that in most Gerrieral acceptances, there are several other synonyms of lt, makes use in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacho, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, the small parties of the leaders appeared in the name of a noble region, more remarkable for its singularities, honoring its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laugh of the fair only attracted his attention, but which might be a calm glance, and threw fear into those fucking tits carefree reigned. Those who felt this sensitivity of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the object of the lho, did not seem penotral, and at a glance pierced through the inner works of the heart too; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead weighed on the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every house; all fought to see him, and those who had been accustomed to the excitement of beer, and now felt the weight of boredom, were positioned to have something in the presence of the hair capable of engaging their attraction. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many women mocked him after his notoriety to gain his attention, and won, at least, some mclrks of what they might call affection: Lady Meroer, who had been the mockery of the aurora monster erected in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw hersels on her way, and made all the cabin put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to draw her attention :— but in the vairi :— when she stood safe from him, her eyes were apparently fixed on her, although jf they were experienced ;— even her unapplied impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But common adultery could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the formal sex was indifferent to him; but such was the apparent water with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to fomals. However, he had the reputation of a winning language; and whoever he was, he even overcame the drift of the Sirigular character, orthal they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice. He was also often among those women who make up the thick boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who sully it by their victims.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to Landon: he was a person left with a single sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was a teenager. The guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, as they demanded the most important burden of his mind for the attention of the smoking mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more flouting his judgment. He had, chance, this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins so many milleners' apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that justice was tbrown iri by Providence simply for the picturesque flaw of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the dowry of clothes, which were also hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various combed patches. He thought, in the sinus, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was the hands, frank, and rich: for these reasons, at his entrance into the gay houses, many mothers surrounded him, trying when should describe with the least lrvth their liking or blushing favorites: the girls at the same time, hy their brightening faces when they approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, he quickly led to false riots of his parents and his merit. Attached as he was to love in his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and candles of wax that sparkles, not from the presence of the type of a ghost, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in the real life for Ari of these congres of pleasant photographs arid descripions contained in those voluines, srom that he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in the Gratified vonity jobs, he was abject to requisition his dreams, where the extraordinary though we described above, went through it in his career.\nHe looked back; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few olfactory signs of hif ohfcrvation of external objects, which lbetacit enslaved to the existence of tbeir, imputed by the avidanoe of their eontact: allowing his imagination to imagine all that has his propensity to extrvaginant ideas, he soon formed this object to the hero of a romance, and decided to observe the offspriving of his fantasy, rather than the person hesore him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far, has started on his opinion, the presence that bis has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rutbvens fairs were embarrassed, and he found soy, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to spoil a certain information with regard to this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he hates his guardians, that it was time for him to execute the tower, which for many generations has thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice towards getting equal with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if they were falling from heaven, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, in accordance with the degree of competence offered to them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoked his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to renew a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem from them, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circular towers.\nHilherto, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Arthur's character, and now he found that although much more of his actors were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indigence by the altergent misfortunes even on virtue, that he escaped his alms ;— they were serious of the door that sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to osk something, rioting to relieve his desires, bul to allow him to harden himself in his Iusl, or to sink hlm still docher in his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater transmission of the vicious, which judiciously prevails over the weakness of the retriring of the virtuous needy. There, a circumstance abdicated charity towards her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those promises that it was granted, involuntarily found that there was a curse on her, because they were either lcd at scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and most abiect misery. In Brussels and others through which they passed, Aubrey was savoured to the apparent eagerness to whip his companion sought out the secrets of also vice in fashion; he put himself in all the spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always played the success with, except where the best known was his antagonist, and then how lofl even more than he won; but he was still with the same ruthless face, with which he generally looked at the society table around: he was not, however, if when he encountered the eruption young novelce, or tbe father without chance to a great family; then his vory wlsh seemed to be the law of fortune — his apparent abscracy of ind was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than the half-dead mouse. In every city, he lifts up the young influence in form, torn from the circle of TB, cursed, in the solitude of a division, the fate that had attracted him without the reach of this friend; while much a father sat frantic, in the middle of the aspect speaking of mute hungry children, wilted a single stuffing of his wealth to immerse late, or even buying enough to satisfy the most fervent present. Yet he took a rio of money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruin of many, then last golder he had just pulled himself out in the convulsive catch of the innocent: this might but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, hawen, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Everyone often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to stop this charity and pleasure which caused the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speculate openly and openly at home; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and I am the various wild and rich soenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was neclr the ohiect of his civriofity, he did not dare more gratification of him than the conslanting excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which the actual imagination began to assume the appearance of something supercltural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost the sight of his companion; he left him every day on the snoring circle of an Italian woman, while he went in search of almost deserted another city memorials. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience cancer; the first was draining his sister, breathing the nothing but affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had previously penetrated into the imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give a bim vain reason to belief. His guardians insisted that he gradually seize his fried, and exhorted, that his character was terribly vicious, for that the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made the bi-licenious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that bis coritempt for adultery had not originated in hatred of his character; but that he had required, in order to strengthen his gratification, that hisvictim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of the insullicd uirtue, until the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, tell all the females whom apparently on account of their virtue had, from his sorvrc, thrown into the mask, and not scrupulously to expose the whoo disormly of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, in order, in this sense, to monitor him more closely, and to let the light circumstances pass without realizing it. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of which he was mainly sequenced. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; so he was forced to wear his folds in secret; but Aubrey eye plowed him in all his windings, and soon decreed that an assignment had 6 th priority, which would probably end in the ruin of an irinocent girl, though insensitive. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to have his summer night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he was supposed to have everything on such an opportunity; and after having been rushed if he intended to marry him, simply confused. Aubrey retired; and immediately, writing a note, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to search for other apartments, and invoked the match of Iady, informed hor of all that he knew, born only with regard to his donut, but also with regard to the chacrater of his Lordship. The assignment was ready. The next day Lord Steven sent his servant more to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suspect that the oshis had been thwarted by Aubrey inlaying.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed his snails to Greece, and colocated with the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then took care to find the traces of ancient monuments of the glory upon which, apparently, were ashamed of the fact that the acts of the free men were not to be chanic in front of the slaves, had hidden under the ground sheltering the ground or many of the colorful Iichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a softener wishing your pertray on the canvas, the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much of spirit for someone to think that she might complain about these evil steps of souls. As she danced on the plain tube, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, a poor type of her beauties would have been bought from the gclzello; for whom he would have cast off his eye, ap parentsly the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted blue to the last of an epic. The light bone step Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for arithmetics, and often to the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmere, showed all the beauty of his form, flattering as he was on the wind, to the euger look of hjm, who forgot the letters that he had just decypbered on an almost erasable tablet, iri the contemplator of his sylphous figure. Often, out of tressef fall, as she flattered around, exposing in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly facing the huef, he might well excite the oblivion of the anthill, which let escape from his mind the very object that he had before bought from the vile importer to their own interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why try to describe charms, feel everything, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being consumed by drawing rooms and stifling balls. Although he was drawing remains of thofa which he wanted to keep a memorial for the next few hours, he stood ready, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the faces of the ber native place; she would describe him a circular dance on the open plain, painted, to stick to all the brilliant colors of the Yovthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered of uiewiring in bor i nancy; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a great impression on her mind, told him all the superriatural tales of her nurse. Her fortune and her apparent belief in what she was telling, her passionate interest, even Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of the vampy living, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and her ties of gilding, forced all the years to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, and he tried to laugh at her apart from so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, who had finally detected 0 living between them, after several of their close relatives and childrenreri had been found marked by the appetite of the friend; and when she found him so unbelieving, he begged him to believe her, for he had seen 6 of them, that those who had dared to question their existence, had always received proof, which forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess that it was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather ocerate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that could not be true in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAvbrey began to cling more and more to London; his innocence, so contrasted with all the victims of the women whom he had sought for his ramance visitors, gained his heart; and as he mocked the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, one was even more bimonthly and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for an antiquarian research, he would leave, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he had always had the impossibility of fixing his attention upwards to the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an imagination that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his goods. Charlie was aware of his love, and always was the same irifantile frankness being that he had known for the first time. Sbe always seemed reluctant to depart from him; but it was because she had rio rio plus diorie with which she could visit her favorite heavings, while her keeper was encrusted in the sketch or discovery of a fragment which had yet escaped from the destructive hand of lime. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, bones, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pole with borbor in the name very. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to continue his excurfions, which had to hold them during the hours of cuckoo; when they saw the name of the place, they all at once a background of their not to return at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where the Greek rio would never remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of those vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denouncing the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representation, and tried to let them out of the idea; but when he saw them trembling to his audacity, so to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their charge free, he was silent.\nOn the morning of Next Aubroy began his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of the bis host, and it began to be believed that his words, mocking the belljef of these horrible friends, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his chest, arid earnestly begged him to return, the night permitted the power of these beings to 6 th put in action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to light up, and there was on the horizon one of those spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a huge mess, and shed all their rage on the devoted land .— He finally, however, rebuked his horse, decided to catch up with speed for the high delay: but it was too late. At two fires, in these climates of the south, so almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his thunders failed had barely a interval of rest — his thick heavy rain drilled his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning began to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, the horse has got scared, and it was corroded with a dreadsul speed through tangled this force. The angel of Iast, by fatigue, stopped, arid, and found, by the glare of the glare, that he was in the vicinity of the shovel which rose up from the masses of dead leaves and the wood that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust jing for the abtain sbeltor of the storm basin. As he approached, the thunders, for a turbulent silence, allowed him to hear the dreadful shrieks of a woman mingling with the etiflcd, exuting mockery of the os a lclugh, continued in an almost his uninterrupted ;—he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder that rolled his head again, he, with a sudden force, forced the door to the shelter of the hut. He found idols in darkness; but the sound guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, without any notice will be taken from him. He found himself in the spirit of someone, whom he immediately grasped; a voice cried out :\" You mocked !\" to which a laudable laugh succeeded; and he felt struck by the one whose strength seemed superhuinan: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but she fought in civil: he was lifted from his sight and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy licked on him, and knelt on his chest, had put his hands on his throat; when dazzling several torches penetrating through the halo that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;— he rose instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a movement, the crossing of the branches, as he broko through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm stopped, and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, the sight of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on all the individual chains with soft flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey, they sought the one who had caught him by his cries; he was again left iri darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of tears burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of bis just conductive brought in an eternity without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that that just was built a visi sur emerging from his confused imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he desolated them, stretched by his side. There was no colour on the cheek, the riot even on his lip; but there was a mortilège on his face which seemed almost as endearing as the life that once had it there went :—on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the veiri :— to this meri poinlé, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A staff quickly formed, and Aubrey was lclided by the side of the one who had been latoly for him, the treatment of his many brilliant and fairy visions, now fallen with the flow of life that bad died to his mind. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and seemed to distance himself from the reflection, and he took the courage in the vacancy, he held very unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soori met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of his woman, a badly missed mother. The lamentable cries of the heir, as the city approached, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe sorrow would be unsuspecting; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked Aubrey, and pointed to the row. They were unconscionable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an irreproachable combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. At other shootings, he permeates the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time of arrived in Athens, and from what motive, during the charge of the sole state Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant servant. When he received his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the hive of which he now had the image combined with that of the Vampyre; but the Lord Ruthuen, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault which had caused their exclamation, and even more by the attention, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled her to his presence. His seigneury seemed to be changed; he did not appreciate that the apathetic boar who hated so surprised Aubroy; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually removed the same stato from the mind, arid Aubrey pereeved no difference from the former man, except that at the time he was surprised to meet his staring gaze fixed on him, with a smile of malice playing on his lips: he did not regret why, but this smile haunted him. During the last wave of recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently committed himself to beating the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or iri marking the progress of these shrubs, turning, like our fawn, the moss-free sun ;— In fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of the alien life.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this astray of the spirit that had once distinguished them now seems to have fled forever. Today he was as much a renter of solitude and silence as he was, Lord Ruthvon; but as long as he wanted greater loneliness, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins which he had once frangled, the shape of Ianthe would stop at his side — if he were in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly turned around, showing, with wild imagination, pale bear face and wounded throat, with a gentle smile on his lips. He determined to fly scenes, each of which created such bitter affections in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthvon, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had brought him during his illness, to visit the parts of Greeoeri or had not yet split. They traveled in a great discord, and looked for all the places where the collection could be forgotten; but, although they were in a hurry from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but gradually they began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined only as an imitation of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the so-called denges risks. In the consecration of not taking into account the advice of the inhabitants, they once behaved with only a guard fcw, more to serve as guides than as defense. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great mass of rock descended from the precipices of the righthouring, they are wrong reasons repent their negligence; for hardly was the hole w of the party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the echoed report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had started fire in the direction from which the same report. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating the example of Tobeir, retired for a moment behind the turn of his file: bvt assiduously retained by an enemy, who insults the shuls to move them forward, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, is all af il volbcrs sb should rising above and taking the cm in the rear, they have determined once the sorward sequence in search of the enemy. When Lord Ruthuen received a bullet in his shoulder, he had barely raised the shelter from the rock, which led him to the ground. Auhrey bclstened to help him; and, no longer taking into account, the contest of his own peril, was soon surprised by seeing the faces of the robbers around him—hjs guards having, on Lord Ruthvens being wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to corrupt his wounded friend to a nearby eabine; and, having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by the presence of Jr — they were content only with the guard entry until their comrade could return with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens training declined rapidly; the mortification of the iri two days followed, and death seemed advariating with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had had about him: but towards the end of the first evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was fixed on Aubrey, who was obliged to offer his bone with more than usual fervors —\" Help me! I do not mean my life, I have listened to the death of my existence as little as the truth of the passing mind; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey said. \" I need a little space, my life ebbs — I cannot explain the whole — but if you were hiding all. you know me, my honaur was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and if my teeth were unknown for some time in England — I— but life. \"-\" We don't know him. \"Sweelr !\" cried the dying man, rising up with an exulent outpouring :\"Swear by all your soul that, by all your nature, you are afraid, swear that, for a year and one day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was running laughing on his pillow, and did not breathe more.\nHe retired to rest, but he did not sleep; the circumcised who were attending his aquaintanco with this man rose up on the Bis Spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his cases, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the pronunciation of something horrible were waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole in which he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer lenc, after having been transmitted by himself and his comrades, on his way, to the pinccle of a mountain of nejghbouring, according to the promise they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of fir trees to the moaning that arose after his death. Aubrey Ostonish, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him to the place where he was. But, when we had mounted your top, he found no trace of either the body or the clothes of them, although the thieves swore that they reported the identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, he was puzzled in his conjectures, but the heat came back for the last time, convinced that they had buried the body badly for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apprehensively corrected to hear that superstitious meancholy that he had seized on his mind, to be rosooved to leave, and soon arrived in Smyrna. Will waiting for a vessel to transport him to your Otranto, or to Naples, he took care to organize the effect he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among others, there was a caso containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently or named in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatol, but — he trembled — impressing himself with gain more proof, he found this weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovers that he adapts, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. The eyes seemed not to need a stealthy certainty: it seemed that the gazeling was bound to the dagger, but still hewifhed to disbelief; but the particular farm, the same varied shades on the shaft and sheath were similar in the splendor in the bath, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and in his unhappy home in Rame, his research on the fir trees involved the lady whom he had tried to tear off the attractive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents are in distress, their fortune has been ruined, and she had not been heard of since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's mental bee almost broke under so many repeated horrors; fear that this lady fell a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postings, as if he were sinking to save the life of the one whom he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his well, soon tied him up to the English fohors; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a while, eager to lose, in the kiss and caress of his siscri, all the memory of the past. If, before, by her inclin caresses, she had acquired her collection, now that the woman had gone to the paper, she was even more accommodating as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the look and applause of the donkeys in the living room. There was no bone that the light shine which exists only in the heated atmosphere of an apartment crowd. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. Thero was a melancholy charm on this subject which did not seem to arise the misfortune of the stomach of a fetid white, who opposed to injquering a coriscjou soul of a brilliant kingdom. His step was not that light footing, which strays where a bottle or a colaur can attract – it was sedate arid pensive. When Olorie, her face was never illuminated by joy; but when her bra gave her her affection, and forgot in her presence, the sorrows she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for this of voluntary? It seemed that these eyes—al face were then played in the light of their own native sphere. It was still only eightoen, and was not presented to the world, it was tangbt by ber guardians more in shape than its presentation should be diverted until the return of his brother from the continuous, when he could be his protégé. This is why it is now decided that the next show, which was fast approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"bvsy scene\". Auhrey would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and fed melancholy which dominated him. He could not be interested in the frivolities of strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the blue event if he had witnessed; he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe world was excessive – a living room had not been held long, and he was rushed to rest in the house of the kingship, he hastened. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood in a horn, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the sentence that the Sirst tiine had seen Lord Ruthven waf at that place, suddenly felt his sons seized by his arm, and a voice he recognized Tao well, sounded in his car ---\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to take possession of a spy who would explode him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn attention to this place on his first enlightenment in society. He looked until his members almost refused to support their weight, he was forced to take the help of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, hethrew himself into his car, they were trained horny. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on the bird's head, as if he feared it would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — the circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his goal. — He wheeled himself, he could laugh that it is possible — the dead rise again! e :— He slipped his imagination and had conjured the image on which his mind rests. It was impossible that it could be real — so he said, to go back to society; although he was tempted to ask about Lord Ruthven, the drama hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in winning the informal. He went a few nights later with his sister, the assembly of a close relationship. By leaving her under protection, he withdrew to a corner, and there he gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, at last, that many left, he woke up, and when entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently iri serious conversation; he tried to pass and get closer to her, when one, when he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him these fantasies that he had the most abborred. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, arid, eager to walk, and forced her to the street; and at the door he was impressed by the crowd of servants who were launching themselves for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again this voice whispering by him :« Remember your goal !\" He dared not the truth, but, pressed his sister, he soon came to the house.\nThe Aubrey is almost dislocated. If before the mind hif hod was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now that the certainty of the ogain living monster prostrates on his thoughts. Sister His attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what had provoked a brutal conduct of bis. He did only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised HLM ;— was he then so that this rnorister would roam, in ruin on his breath, just all that he loved, and not prevent his progress? He could have touched his insulator. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his supplications, who would believe it? He thought he was using his own band to free the world from a wretched man; the death of a hut, he remembers, had already mocked beer. For days, he remembered himself in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his caine sister, who, with cyes flowing with tenors, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. At the tip, he is not able to be immobile and mad, he leaves his hoof, wandering from To the street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the indoor humidity. He was rio longer to be recognized; at first he returned home in the evening; but finally he put down to rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for security, employed people to follow him; but they were quickly removed by the one who fled from a pursuer faster than any – from thought. His conduct, a scam, suddenly collapsed. Struck by the idea that he was afraid of his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, whose their presence was unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to look at them closely, anxious to foresee, despite the oath bis, all that Lord Ruthveri approached privacy. But when he entered a room, bis hamgard and suspicious flakes were beating, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg him to refrain from looking for, for her, asoclety which touched a strongly help from. However, when the demonstration turned out to be non-availiling, the guards considered it appropriate to consider....\nFearing that his mind would be alienated, they believed that it was a high time to regain the trust they had imposed on them by Aubrey inclinations.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, enthused to prevent him from exposing to the genetic eye, the morks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His income sentence has finally become so green, that he has been confined to his room. There could often lie for a day, unable to be awake. He had moved, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the sign bone affection and memory manifested itself on the entrance of the store; then which sometimes began, and, by selecting his haries, with eyes that afflicted him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, approach him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was referring to, he said to her ,\" Really! True !\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year passed, its inconsistencies have become frequent less, stir up his mind thrown out of part of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that once in the day he counted on his fingers, a number defiri ite, arid then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room began to conjure his doctor on the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys situation in such a bad situation, when his sister was about to get married the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Cold de thifmark de retuming the intellect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey rejoiced, and surprised them still plus by his expression of his intention to be near to the nuptiols, and deciding to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few moments, his sister was with him. It seems that it is again possible to be affected by the influence of her pretty smile; for which pressed her in her air, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of her brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with such a distinguished person and every achievement; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monsler who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, the orid trampled him foot under. At his request, he thus destroyed the likeness of his suture husband, he looked as if he had not been under the ground — by grasping his hands then, and observing him with a frenetic expression of counlency, he made him swear that she would never marry that monster, so he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that, as it was that the voice again again mal reminds him of his oath — he suddenly turned red, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him, but saw the radio one. Meanwhile, the guards and the physicjan, who had heard the whole, and yet it was only a return from his driver, entered, and saw him from Miss Aubrcy, asked him to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged to delay him, but for one day. They, attributing this to insanity, had taken possession of his mind, considered pacifying them, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning to swell the living room, and had been refused with each else. When he heard Aubreys ill health, he readily understood himself to be the author; but when he learned of the fight, he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be confused with those among whom he had obtained this information. Hc hastened to the house of his companion former, and, by a constant attitude, and the claim of a great affection from far brother him and interest in his face, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. What could I resist his power? His torigue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no syrnpathy with any being on earth crowd, except with her to whom he added ;—coveld to say how, as he knew her, her existence, had begun to some worthy conservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his blood accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or that was the will of destiny, that he spoiled his affections. He received him the title of the elder branch falling al length, an important embassy, which served as an excuse to hasten the age ,( in spite of the disturbed state of Hcr brother ,) which was to take place the same day before his death for the continent.\nAubrey, what was he afraid that the doctor and his guardians would do all they could to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for paper and pen; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, working on it, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the gravo, who held his arms iri lheir of their hope and the hope of lheir house, to delay the bill for a few hours of this marriage, on which he denounced most of the heovy curses. The servants argued that they were delivered just; 6vt going to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the humble prisoner of thehauso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can more easily be imagined as described, the notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on the back ear. Aubreygrew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally avercame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the custody of an old impotent woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, and just for a while found herself in the apartment where all was almost there. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him out of the room, without fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his lock :\"Remember your goal, and know, if today not my fiancée, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had bewitched him. Every no longer supported himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken hood-vessels, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to the sister of this, who was not present when he entered, or the doctor was afraid to shake it. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nAbbreys weakness increased; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he wrote down what the reader had lost — he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards flouted your protection, Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF the LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose his place of real, and Gravence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still at the 6th had there, prompted the British ships marry to visit it — both the men of war and the merchant; and although it is rather off the track for the ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums fully reimbursed for the deviation of a language. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men mixed up in water, arching the stock exchange that negotiated the cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical. and I took a ramble to the ave called Homers School, around other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (small nominated mound ), we met a young Greek as a guide, who in Idus came from Scio with an English lord, who left the island a few days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" said the Greek ,\"and would have taken me with a humor hjm; but I did not choose to leave Mltyleno, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The contract on the bill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old charge husband iri: he gave Dominick, the wine-trodcer, six hundred zoehines for her ,( clout L 25 o English currency ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he is buried in his felvcca very often on the islands' differences .\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we do not have time to hasten at the house where our countrymarihad resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who led us to the mission. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were simply disembarked: united green walls, ori marble tables on either side, a myrtle largo in the center, and a small brieath fountain, which could be made to play through the bracbes by moving a fixed source in the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa copulated the furniture. In the room stood a half-do 2 in English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were not mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting room, we obsessed with a marble recreation. Once, the old man typed us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the closet: it was opera, but we did not think that ours were justified to examine the content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltajre, Shakespeare, Boileau, and Rovsfeou complete works; the ruins of the empires of Volney; Ziminermon, in German; Klopslock of Messiah; the novels of Kotzebue; Schjllerplcly of theRohbers; the Paradise of MiIton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek pros in Constantinople, very torn, but no English description of the company. Most of these books bore marginal notes, written with a person, in Latin arid Italian. Mossia was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had read these books in the evening before being sailed, and forgot to place them with others; a bull,\" he said ,\" They must lie there until his return; for it is so special that if I pushed a worthwhile order thing, would be frowri on me for a week together; it is always very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a wood of small and which the lord brought from Adrlanaple; I do not know for the reason for the hunt.\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the pillars of marble made with black plinths and fret work cornios ,( as it is now usual in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the rouss. The roof, overlaid by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen string. Most of the oretops are so furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings in the sinoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the perpetual breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, when we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and sage-growers were crouching on the edges, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbling feat with an ornamental wooden waf, placed on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until midnight, reading, weeping, and laughing for himself. \"I guess,\" said the old man ,\"playing\" so that he brags very, and always tied our church twice for a week, hesside Sundays .\"\nThe frame view of this seat was what could be terrified of \"a bird-eye view .\" A line of rich minerals led the eye to Mount Calclo, caves of olives and blooming blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majesto decomposition. A stream of the commercial center from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountains. The sea smooth like glass, and a horjzon not overshadowed by a single eloud, finishes the view in front; and o little on the foot, through a view of high arid palms chesriut, several small islands distinctly observed water, spreading the wave of light blue with spots of emerald green. I had a view more than I did; build our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this solid romantic: no one knew a hif nickname but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" did our corider, cold tell ,\"but I sure he won\" and Cannol you say, old friend ?\" he said ,\"If I can\", he said ,\" I dare not. We do not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several peculiarities of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls. He was the last on the island, the scene was dancing with them to the bridal sea. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and Colton and talked to the girl who lives by weaving these items. Hc also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a game, and was osten gauge Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have collected, to have been a very arid character very eco-efficient. A circumstance that we bequeathed, which our old friend at the cottage asked Praper not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom we often saw the world walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him how to use it.\nThis was the informality with which we got away from the peaceful island Mitylene bones; our imaginative wall on the rack, guess who this crawler in Greece could be. He had bad money, it was ovi dent: he had a plurality of disposition, and all the activities that mark the personality genius. Arrived atalermo, all our doubts have been dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual al ,\" said being ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I visited him al Mililone .\" We had never had the renown of his secretary, as we had been a few years of homicide; but \"Childc Harolde\" being put in hands before we recognized the reclus Calcla bones on each page. Deeply Did we regret being more curious about our research at the cottage, but we consoled ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene one day of fortune ;6 to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing that he is not an interesting, and in court in the good name of his secretary, who has been greatly slaridored. It has been described as a urifeling provision, a course to associate with human nature, or contribute to the way in which to appease its sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be simply gathered from these little anecdotes. All the sinister feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lard, seem to settle in his bosom. The terepidity, sympathy and thority appear to all his actions; and to remove his rest from salitude is an additional reason for the Mar king as an ori being whose heart the Religion has put his bosom, a cold over whose head Benevolence has shaken his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be proceeded with caution, in part when directed again the moral integrity of man; and whoever dares to justify himself in front of this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a fall of sorrow. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his geniuses. Doing good in secret, and feeling the applause of the world, is the furiousest testimony of a viruous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Sleet.",
    "28": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John Williain Polidori.\nThe superstition concept that this story is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, he did not externalize himself to the Greeks according to the establishment of Christianity; he normally assumed his present before since the division of Latin and Greok ohurohes; at the time, the idea that he dominated oming, that a Latin body could not corrupt if he drank on their territory, he gradually increased, and forinated the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising in their gullies, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belljef existed, that the vampyres were rejuvenating a certain part of the blood of their victims, who hocam cmacialed, lost their strength, and died quickly at the consumption of f; while these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, in order to shed the blood of all passages of their body, and the oven of the pores itself of thorian skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, the credihle story of a vampyrian oss particular case, which is stoed to be acquired in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magjstrats of the placo was positive and without animosity, that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heorded to say that, Clt Cassova, at the borders of the Tvrc Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land of lho from the tomb of Tbe vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy swallow; for about twenty-thirty days after his death and burial, many people complain about having been carried away by the hive, and a statement was made, that the four people had been deprived of life by his attack. To avoid new evils, the inhabitants have oonsuted their Hadagni, took up the body, and found (as it supposed to be usual cases of vampyrism iri) fresh, and completely free from corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and cars, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the accident remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Claims heart and body, where he would have been so terribly ordered as if he had been alive. It was done, they cut off his head, opened his body, Arid, threw the ashes at his grave. The same measures were adopted with the trains of these Persians who had died before the vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre herself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThe monstrous rodomontade tuft is linked here, as it appears to be better suited to the present observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts, Grocce bone it is so considered as a kind of punishment after death, for an inheritance crime committed while it existsenco, it is the death not only condemned to vampyrise, but complicated to limit the infornal visits only to the beings he loved the most on earth, to whom who was bound by ties of kinship and infection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, as Vampyre sent him, let the corsus shall of his toe be praised; then haunt the native placo, and suck the blood of all thy grapple: there smote thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet take away the banquet that punctuates Mvst shall feed thy living corsus, Thy victims, And they shall perish again, and know thee of mine for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, and curseth them, and thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But the one who, for your crime, must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will brief you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! You must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of your cheek, the last spark of Ber's eye, and the glorious frost that freezes his blue without a lip, Then, with the unhumiliated hand, 1 tear Tho weaves his yellow hair, of which, reading a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been worn — But now is barren away from your Memorial of your agony! And the best blood shall flow; thy grinting tooth, and thy scratching ljp; and thou shalt hunt thy sulten tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more gripped than they.\nMr. Southey presented also in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thillaba\", the vampire of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having resumed from the grave with the aim of tormenting him, she loved the whole better in existence. Both cannot be assumed to have resulted from the sinfulness of their life, it has been spilled over the whole tale as a complete type of pure arid innocence. The veritable Tournesort gives a long accompaniment in his journey of amazing cases of vampyrifm, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illuftrative of its effects, pointed out some dissortations léclrned, tends to prove that it is a classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nA lot of curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible view pleaserstitjon are added; about the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily deuoted to exlaration, and which can now be concluded that the term Vampyro is that in the most general acoeptation, there are several other synonyms with it, made use of bone in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoul acha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT happened shot in the middle of the dislpations accompanying upori a London winter. It appeared to the various politics of the chiefs of the Tori, a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, their rank. He looked at the glimmer as if he was taking part. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted attention to bis, that it could by a glance stifle it, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness risen. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whooh, staring on the face of the object of Tbe, did not seem to penetrate, and to the look of once to pierce through the iriward works of the heart; hut fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that we made on the skin He couldn't get through. His personalities led Bim to be invited to each house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been used to the excitement, and now felt the weight of erinius, were happy to bring something in their presence able to erect their attention. Despite the emotion of her face, which gave a warmer hue, either fred the blushing modesty, or the strong emotion of passion, although her shape was flouted, many female hunters after the riot tried to gain her attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they were talking about affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfleur worn in drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a mountain bank, to attract her attention :— although unvain :— that she had stood before him, although her eyes had apparently been fixed on her, yet it seemed that they had not understood him ;— even her inapplicable imprudent was flouted, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to this virtuous woman and innocent girl, while few knew that he addressed himself to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that he overcome the fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among those females who make up the boast of their fram sex their domestic virtues, as among those who push him by their vices.\nAbout the same time, he came to London, a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also to himself by guards, who thought that they had only to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the greater burden of his mind to the care of subaltem mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, Bence, this romantic feeling of honor raised on the franchise, whipping so many apprentices every day of millenarians. He began to sympathize and thought that Vico was launched by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romonées: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the jacket of clothes, which was also hot, but which were better suited to the cyes of the painter by their irregular folds and the various coloured spots. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circles, many mullhers surrounded him, attacking what they would describe with the least truth, their languishing or blushing favourites: the naughters at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparklingyes, when he opened his lips, soon took him into the riots of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to learn that, except in the tall and firkored wax candles, not of the presence of aghosl, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no faunting in real life for one of these congerjes of pleasant photos and descriptions covered in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Faithful, commenting, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up dreams this, when the extraordinary being that we had overscribed, met him in his key.\nHe looked at him, and the same incapacity to form the ari leader of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other slgns of his observer of extremal objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implied by lbe avoiding their contact: to allow his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, to be saon formed this object irito the hero of a romance, and determined to observe the offspring of his floy, rather the person before itss. He became acquainted with him, paid attention to him, so far attached to the Bi riot, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were stunned, and he soon discovered, according to the preparation notes on the street, that he was about to travel. He has seized a certain information with regard to this singular caroeter, which, until now, has done only a bad blow of curiosity, he has seized his guard, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few steps in the career of vice to get equal with the elderly, and only allow them to appear as if fallen from the sky, to be longing intrigues scandalous aro mention of the subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill that there was to carry the lhem. They consented; and Avbrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive love to him about joining him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem brake bjm, which, apparently, had nothing common iri with other lines, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nMatthew, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he found, talk, though much more of his co-\nIn his view, the results offered different conclusions from the motives to his conduct. His companion was profusion in his liberality ;— the idle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to meet their immediate needs. But Auhrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes that accompanied even on virluus, that he had bestowed his alms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came, asking something, not relieving his desires, bul to cling to him in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicovs, which usually prevails over the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the purity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed with her spirit: all those whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all either led to scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other towns through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion began to seize the centres of all fashionable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played successfully, except where the best known was his Aritagonist, then lost even more than he earned ;6 But it was always with the same face, and he generally looked at society around him: it was not, in what way, therefore, when he encountered the novice Yauth eruption, or the father without the chance of a family of numbers; their very desire seemed against the law of the ind — this apparent abstraction of the ind was removed, and his eyes shone with more fire than the cat while deliring with the mouse half dead. In each city, he left the deafening youth, torn from the circle, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the falo that had drawn hlm within the reach of this proud; while mony sat frantic, most tbe spoakiring gazes of muto hunger children, without a single farthing of its end immcnse richness, where with even buying enough to satisfy their presorit desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to spoil them of many, the last florin that he came from the snatchod of the convulsive group of the innocent: this might but to be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to take the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and not took care of his own profile ;— but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to make him openly and open; however, this never happened. Lard Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the wild and rich varioves of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid although Aubrey was close to the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the exciting exciter of violent wanting to break this mystery, which at his imaginative exoltode began to assume the appearance of supernaturol fomething.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of them; he left the bjm iri every day in the morning circle of an Italian castress, while he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted party. He was thus hired, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first was from his sister, opening nothing but effect; the others came from his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered into his imagination that the lerc was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted on his immediate gift of his friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, for the irresistible possession of the powers of seduction, made if licentious hash more dangerous for society. He had discovered bcen, that his contract for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but that he had reciprocated, strengthened his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guild, swarming from the pinaole of unwelded virtue, to the lowest cliff of the insamy and degradation: in the end, that the 1st sernals which he had sought, apprivoly because of their virtue, had, slnce his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and held unscrupulous to expose all the deformation of their vices to the pubic gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, which the character had not yet shown a single point right on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent plausible pretexts to abandon him completely, by seeking, by means, to monitor him more closely, and not to let pass any light circumstance by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mostly frequenting the top. Iri Italy, it is sad that an unmarried woman is met in society; he was therefore obliged to continue plans bis in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windirigs, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would be lost as if she ended up in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Losing the lime, he seized Lord Ruthvens apartment, and asked him for his indolence towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet his night of that story. The Lord Ruthven watered himself, that his inlentlons were such that he would have had on such an occasion; and after being pressed that he had inflamed himself to marry him, laughs inerly. Aubrey withdrew; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this motherrit must decline the accommodation of his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and sticking to the cc mother of the lady, inform him of all that he kries, not only with regard to his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignment was pre-verified. The next day Lord Ruthven merely served his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not suggest any suspension of his plans having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his steps towards Greeco, and crossing this Periinsula, soon to ring himself in Athens. He then took care, in the house of a Greek, of the accounts of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, were ashamed to tell only the acts of free men as slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many colorful lies. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful a delicate wave, that she could have formed the model of a softener who used to rot ori carivass the hope promised of the future in the Mohammed period, said that her eyes spoke too much spirit for anyone so that she could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or tripped along the side of the mountain, it would have been thought that the gazel 1 was a bad type of its beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the animate natural eye, for this sleepy look luxurious of the suitable animal but to the taste of a spy. The light stage of Iantbe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the incorruptible girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of his shape, floating as he was on the wind, to the brass look of him, who forgot the letters he had deciphered upwards a column erased tablet, in contemplation of his figurro sylph. Often, her stress would fall, while she flattered around, oxhihit in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and would fade from hues, he might well excuse her forgotten of the antiquarian, who let his mind escape from the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the true irritating preparation of a passago in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing ramps and stifling bullets. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a mernorial fruit in the future, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of her perici1, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would then describe to revive the circular dance on the open plain, painted, at home in the glowing colors of the tulhful memory, the marlage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, told her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His interest, even for Aubrey; and often as she told him the story of the varnpyre liouing, who had spent years among the hjs friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a washed home to prolong his existence during the months that followed, bis blaod wou cold, while he tried to laugh out of such idle and horrible fantasies; hut Ianthe quoted at hjm the names of old men, who had finally detected one living among the lhernes, after several of the bir near relatives and children had been found marked with the stamp of friend appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, he begged him, for he had noticed, those who had dared to question their existence, had always had given evidence given that he had had the impression of seeing them, and that he had had the impression of being true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror increased, hearing a rather exact description of Lord Ruthven; he, commenter, still, persisted on persuading her, that the thorc could not be the truth in his fears, though at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Stevens supernatural power.\nAubrey bogan to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the woman among which both had sought for his vision of romance, gained his heart; while he ridiculed the idea of a young man in English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, limon was increasingly attached to the almost fairylike form 6 before him. He was tearing himself from her, and, sleeping a plan of antiquarian research, he fled, decided the riot to return until his treatment was reached; but he always found that he hesitated to focus his attention on the ruins that surrounded him, and he kept in his mind an image that seemed to be the only right possessor of his purchases. Nathan was unconscious of her love, and was still the same frank childine being who had first known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but he was because she had no more once with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or unraveling frogs that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to the grandparents on the subject of Vampyres, and lhey both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to pursue one of his excursiori, which prevented him from holding him for a few hours; if they barbed the name of the place, they all begged not to come back at the same time at night, if he necessarily passed through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, the more the day had passed, on any celebration. They described it as the resort of the vainpyref in the nocturnal orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as impending on the one who dared cross their path. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and he tried to laugh at them out of the idea; but when he saw them trembling with his audacity to mock a superior, infernal power, the same name that seemed to shape their freeze, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had struck them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Nathan came to the side of his horse, and begged him to come back, the night passed allowed to put the power of these beings into action ;— the promised. He wos, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, arid that in the harizori there was one of those wieh spccks, in the warmer cimates, so quickly gath er in a tromendous rnass, and pour all the rage of toil on the devoted country .— He Finally, he climbed his horse, determined to catch up with speed: but it was too late. Twilight, in these Soviet climates, is almost uriorized; immediately sunsets, njghl begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the star will abave—his thundering echoes had horribly a resting interval—the heavy thick rclin forced his way through the solilage of the canopy, while the sorcery blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at bis very feet. Suddenly, the horse bis became afraid, and he was carried with the rapid dreadful through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through the fatigue, stopped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, the hot be was in the vicinity of a hovel that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to help him get to the city, or shelter himself as little as possible from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, scratched his ear from the dreadful shrieks of a woman mixing himself with the fiery mockery, exulting with a laugh, contrived iri, an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised: but, ro used by the thunder that overturned his head, he, with an effort fudderi, forced the door of the hul. He hid himself in total darkness: the sound, the commentator, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was a sign of him. He sounded himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately grasped; when a voice shouted ,\" Always mocked !\" to which a great laugh succeeds; and he felt struck by a force which he seemed superhuman: dlermined to consecrate himself as much as he could, he struggled; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet, bowed with enormous force against the ground ;– his enemy threw himself on HLM, and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands down. upon his throat — when the glory of many torches penetrating through the ball that gave light in the morning, disturbed him ;— he infiltrated, and, leaving his prey, rushed near the door, arid at the moment the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer cashed. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by this pilot. They entered; the height of their torches fell into the mud walls, arid the loaded tip on each straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the delre of Aubrey, they were looking for his wife had attracted him by his cries; he will again left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches flashed once again upon him, to perceive the aerial farm of his beautiful driver brushed in a course of liftles. He beat his eyes, hoping that it was built a vision raising frustrated his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he unlocked them, lying by his side. There was not a colover on his eheek, an oven of riot over his lip; but there was a silence on his face which seemed as alinotic as the life that once lived there :— on his blood of rice and waf breast, and on his throat where the marks of teeth having operated the vein of tob :— on this tob men plow, weep, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A Iitter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid by the fidelity of her who had recently shined for hlm the object of so many brilliant and misleading visions, now fallen with the flow of life that had died with it. He did not know what he thought — his mind was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held in his almost uroriscious hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the but. They were soon welcomed by different parties that I had been engaged in the matter of when she was a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, they approached the city, the parents warned of some terrible calastrophe. \"Sorrowing their grief would be impossible; but when they discovered the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica\". They were wearing inconsolable clothing; a blood-drink heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized of a violent inost sever, and was often delirium; in these intervals he could call Lord Rutbven and on Ianthe—by an incompatible combination, he saw the log of his former companian to spare the being that he loved. To other linden trees, he permeates the equations called on his head, and cursed him as his voyeur. Lord Ruthven, had the chance at that time of arriving in Athens, and from any rnotive, until the hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house of the samo, and became his constant companion. When he withdrew from his deljrium, he was horrified and amazed at his sight. The age of the woman He had now combined with that of a vampire; but Lord Ruthven, by his words kirid, involving almost repentanoe for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the Altentian, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soori reconciled with the presence. His seigneury seemed quite shaken; hc appeared no more than the clpathelic being who had so astounded Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, arid Aubrey perceived rio differentice from the former man, except that sometimes hc was taken to meet his gaze fixed on him, with a smile of malicious exuitation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last period of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to observing the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless suri ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once distinguished him so much today had eased to escape forever. Today he was as fond of the solitistic and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his spirit could not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he had so much frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sows him in the woods of Tbe, his small step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest violet; Tben would suddenly turn around, show, to his wild imagination, a huge pale, wounded face, with a sweet smile towards the top of his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which have created such bitter assoclation in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had taken from him by attaching himself to his life, that they did not visit the parts of Greece and that they had not yet seen. They moved in all directions, and looked for all the places that a memory attached; but, even if they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they had done. They have heard a lot of thieves, they gradually began to light reports lhesis, that they imagined were only the invention of individuals, that there was the interest to excited the geriosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, on occasion they traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as gravies only as a shed. When entering, however, a narrow defilo, at the bottling af that was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock brush down from the nearby preclpices, they were right to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly all of the party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by then echoes the report of several gvns. In a moment, the guard had a loft, the m, and by placing themselves behind the rocks, had begun to shoot at the ditcllon that the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the tum sheltered from the defilement: butashamcd to be held by an enemy, who, with the insulted Bahe thin advance, and being exposed to the slaughter vnresisting, if one of the thieves should drink clbove and take the cm in this reor, they immediately determined to rush into the mercb of theeriemy. They had barely lost the shelter of Tbe Rock, when Lord Ruthven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened his help; and, no longer taking into account the procession or his own peril, was soon furious when he saw the faces of the robbers about him – his having guards, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was wounded, immediately bleed their arrns and surrender.\nIn promising a reward for the great, Aubrey soon encouraged Thomas to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; having agreed on a ransom, he had not been disturbed by the presence of Tbeir — they were simply content with the entrance until their eomrade came back with the promised svm, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to accelerate. His arid conduct clearrico evil did not change; he seemed unconscious of the pain of he had been of the objeots about him: bvt towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, arid his often fixed eye upon Aubrey, who was led to offering his donkey more than several ferries —\"Assist me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I listened to the death of my existence like the death of the day passing; but you can save my honor, the thank you of your friend. \"-\" How? Tell me. What do you mean? I do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need a little bit of but, my life flourishes, I cannot explain the whole, but if you go to the ocean everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and if my death had moved for something to England —I— but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Jure !\" cried the dying man, rasing himself with exulting violence,' Swear by all your soul prowling, by all nature fear, swear it, for one day of the year and year you will not give your knowledge of my ores or of that to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out ,\" I swear ,\" said Aubrey ;\" He laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but didn't sleep; the married circumstances that were present at his knowledge with this man arose upon his mind, and he didn't understand why; who he reborn his oath an old shivering came upon him, as if by the present of horrific enchantment waited for him. Arise early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a robber met a bim, and informed him that it was no longer there, having been transmitted by his sons and comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, granting to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he was exposed to the first ray of dawn that rose at the back of his death. Aubrey closed up, and put the men seriously, dissuaded from going to bury him where he was. But when he died at the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would pray the same rock on which they had aided the body. For a son, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he in Iast turned back, convinced that they had buried the corpse serving the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible evildoers, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had cut itself on his mind, he breathed to leave her, and soon arrived at Smyrna. As he launched himself for a uessel to transmit Hlm to Dtrarito, near to Naples, he took care to organize these effects which he had with him 6 extending to Lord Ruthven. Arnongst other things there was a case containing sevoral weapons of advice, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were sour, daggers and ataphans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious sleeps, what was his surprise at finding an ornamented sheclth appeared in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he hastened to get more evidence, he finds the wcapori, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adapts, although particularly shaped, the sheath ho heid in the bis hand. His eyes did not seem to need more cortality, they seemed to be giving bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same different shades on the haft and the rest were similar in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Rome welcomed his first inquiries into the lady whom he had tried to attack Lord Stevens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's spirit was almost broken under so many abrogated horrors; he made a raid that this lady had been the victim of the destroyer of Iarithe. He was morose and silent; and his only job is to exhort the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He stopped at Calclis; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tumbled him on the English shores; and he hastened to hasten from his father's dwelling, and there, for a while, bound to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his seat, all the memory of the past. If previously, by her infantile caresses, had gained big affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more endearing as an employee.\nMiss Aubrey is bad not that the grace winning which wins the look and applause of the salon assemblies. Thorc wasn't one of those brilliant lights that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the spirit of the teeth. There is a melancholic charm that did not seem to come from an evil, but from an inner feeling, which seemed to indicate the conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not only 1 foot, which strays where a butterfly or a color can attract — he was sedated and pensive. Alone, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother blew her affection, and he forgot in her presence these details, she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for that of the vocabulary? It seemed that these eyes—that face was then opening to the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, arid had not been presented with the world. It was thought by her guardians more that her presentation should be delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, where he could be his protector. It was now, for that reason, that the next show, which was approaching quickly, had to be the touch of its irito ritry the \"busy scene\". Aubrey ralher hove would remain in the marion of her fathers, and fed melancholy that aborted her. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been annihilated as a drawing-room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had been held not for a long time, and everything that was anxious to rest in the kingly smile, hastened either. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood alone in a corrier, without worrying about everything around the bim, he undertook to remember that the first time he saw Lord Ruthven was in that place, he suddenly felt loved by the arm, and a voice which he also recognized the saddle, sounded in his ear :\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to attract, fearing to see a spectre that would explode this, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure as the one that was bad.\nIt was at that time that he was noticed when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he began to take his arm, a friend, and force a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was driven home. He passed over the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his heel, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst with bis. Lord Ruthven again, he — circumstances went on in a terrible picture — the dogger — his oath. — He made him a dream. He could not believe that he was possible — the dead rose again! e :— He thought his imagination had contributed to the image on which his fury lay. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; far to attempt to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his ips, and he could not succeed in getting information. He went a few nights after beating his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and gave to his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, finally, whom many were leaving, he awakened, and when entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he attempted to pass the cold to get her, when one, whom he asked to renovate, turn around, and revealed to him these traits he abhorred red. And he went forth, and shook his sister's arm, and rushed to make her pass through, and forced her to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the multitude of servants waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again the whispered voice by the hive :\"Remember your oath !\"\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the culture of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was Jan See that she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. Did his oath dazzle him?\" Was this monster then able to wander, carry ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent him from progressing ?\" His sister, having, was touched by him. But even if he were to blur his oath, and reveal his suspicions, what would he believe? He was thinking of deploying his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he remembers, had already mocked. In great days, he remembered himself in this state; he rose up in his remorse, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for her, to sustain nature. Finally, being no longer able to flout around loneliness, he left his house, wandering from street to street, anxious to see that image that haunted him. Her dress became neglected, and hewandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight damps. He was not longer to be recognized; he returned with the evening at home; but at last he lay down to rest where the fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but he was soon removed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any storm thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that by his absence he left all his friars, with cold friends among them, bones whose presence they were unconscious, he dissuaded from entering society again, and looked at him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven operated with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and distrustful look was so striking, his inner thugs were so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg of him to refrain from seeking the right, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain alien trust that had been imposed on them by the parents of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save Bim from the wounds and suffering that he had encouraged every day in his waridorings, and to prevent him from opposing to the general eye, these marks of what toy considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him constantly. He seemed vaguely to notice it, if completely his mind was absorbed by one terrible subject. His incoherence finally became a great stop, that he was confined to his room. There would be a lie for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory remained displayed himself at the entrance of his sister; then to be a world sometimes to begin, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that seem deeply distressed hor, he would desire her not to touch the bim. \"Oh, don't kill him; if your love for me is strong, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, her only will answer ,\"Truc! True !\" Arid again, he sank in a state, from which she could not wake him. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was passing, its influences are less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his room, which his guards observed, that several times in the day he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room began to converse with a physicist about the melancholic circumstance of Aubrey's behavior in a situation. so awful one, when his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately stirred up; he asked the anxiously whom. Happy with the darkness of the return of the intellect, whom they feared had been deprived of, they lied to the drama of the Count of Mclrsdon. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Avbrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his expression of his intonlion to be present at the nationals, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was wary of him. He was apparently again able to be struck by the influx of his beautiful smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, fighting at the occasion of the fact that his brother was once inordinate alive to feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate his horror marriage with a person so indignant for rank and every achievement; when he suddenly pierces a medallion on sahrest; open it up, what was his surprise to see the characteristics of the monster who had so long instilled his life. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the relationship of her future husband, he seems good as if he did not understand ber — then seizing his hands of ber, and looking at ori hcr with a frenetic expression of face, how brie his swear that she would never marry this monster, because he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice once again put his eye on him — he suddenly turned around, thinking Lord Rutbven was close to him, but saw a rio one. Among the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole, arid thought it was only a return of her disorder, erite, and Miss Aubreys forcing, wanted her to leave him. He flatters himself on his knees towards them. He pleads, he pleads with them for one day. Since the irisanity imagined the possession of the spirit, it was striving to pacify it and withdraw.\nLord Rulhven had called the morning after the salon, and had been refused to beon with all the other ones. When he discovered Aubreys ill health, he seized himself to be the cause of it; but when he bequeathed that he was considered mad, the exultation and pleasure of this could be smitten by those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant ardour, and the presence of great affection for the brother and inleresl in his destiny, he gradually gained his Aubreys ear. Who could resist its power? His language had dangers and things to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy for any being an overcrowded land, except with the one to whom he should add himself ;—could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not that, he could listen to her soathing aoconts ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the desire of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the Brazilian elder falling long to him, he kept an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother-\ne ,) which was to take place the day before the departure of this on the continent.\nAubrey, when he left by the doctor and his guardians, hastened to bribe the searchers, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was he who gave it; he sent it a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her happiness, her honor, arid the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once held it in their arms as the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants assumed that they would dilute it; but throwing a finger at the doctor, he thought that he would bet that he would no longer harass Miss Aubreys spirit by, what he considered, greasing a moniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with horror, perhaps that the well-filled preparation notes can easily be blown away as described. Morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in a frantic almost. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the study of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tied man was out of the room, and in a motherrit found himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. Wberi on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in the bis \"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not the day of my bride, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his companions, who, awakened by the old woman, had Carne in search of him. Aubrey could not support Ionger himself; his rage found no vent, had broken a vehicle of blood, engaged he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nEvery weakness increased; the bestowal produced symptoms of nearly each of death. He wanted the guardians of sister who had to be called, and when the hour in the middle of the hour had struck, he connected somehow when the roder hos perus — to be dead immediately after.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubreyf's sister had slipped at the end of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his rest and Providence his guidance .\"\nIN Sailing the Greek archipelago, aboard one of the vessels of majesty hjs, iri lheyear 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the jsland of that dwarf. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, bring many British swans to the list-both warmen and merchants; and it is rather other black for the ships linked to your Smyrna, its premiums quickly repay for the deviatlon of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the sacrillary man negotiated with the cattle. That is, we took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and in other plains, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with a Lord English, who raised the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" he said ,\" and he took me with him; but I did not dare to leave Milylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man to charge of he: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he often fails in his felucca to the various jslands .\"\nThis account greatly exacerbated our curiosity, and we do not have time to hasten at the house where our compatriot had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us to the marriage. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a rodle-room, a living room of ingots, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated in a simplified way: united green walls, marble tahles on another side, an large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain underneath, which could be made to play through the branehef by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posturc; a large sofa or sofa completes the furniture. In the hall, stood a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only a large carpet spread on the floor, with stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble break, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers that he was then carrying in a large sailor's chest in the closet: it was open, but we have not justified ourselves in the examination of the content. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and the works of Rousseau compiete; Volney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German language; Klopstook's Messiah; Kolzebues novels; Schiller's play of Robbors; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parmcl in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, very torn, are not a book description in English. Most of these books were accompanied by marginal notes, written ten with apencil, in Italiani and Lotin. The Messiah was literally scratched, and marked with a little paper, on which also wrote the remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had read those 6 takes the oven before he sails, and forgot to place them with the others; hul ,\" he said ,\" there they do not lie about his return; for he just so special, that if I move a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is indeed very good. I once did a service; and I had the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of just, except for twenty zechins which I paid to an old Armerian who resides in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for which reason .\"\nThe appearance of the outer house table was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps Iong and fourteen broad, and the marble looters canned with black plinths and fret work cornices ,( cls just is now temporary in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, under an awning of coarse linen string. Most of the roofs of the house are inflamed, because the Greeks spend their time smoking, drinking light wine, like \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left harid, as we entered the house, a small brook glidod far away, grapes, arid lime oranges were set in motion together with its borders, and under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until two o'clock, redirecting, writing, arid speaking. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and always attended the church of the ovary twice a week, besides Sunday .\"\nPerhaps the view of this siege was from the whale, that is, a bird view. A liria of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and myrtle in bloom, arid on the top of which a tenple Greek anodist appeared in majestic decay. A small stream from the boneless ruins of cascadcs broker, until it was the first in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the air horizon undressed by a single lovd, tormineed blue seen in front; and a little on the side, near a view of a high cheftoise and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emeraid green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our enquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solicited: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I sure he won\" he said ,\"carinot you, my old friend,\" he said ,\"if I can,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" \" We didn't have time to live in the American, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with the wedding party. He carried a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who loved by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a whole fisherman who had lost clean bags in a storm, and was Greek government Testaments for poor children. In horror, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we have learned, that over an old friend to the cottage that is proper not to reveal. He had a beautiful master's daughter, with whom the lord was seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guarding that this crawling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eocentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylerie .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years home fram; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognize the process of Calcla on every page. Have we not regretted that we have been more curious about our research on the little, but we have comforted ourselves with the idea of relurning to Mitylene one day of suture; but to me that day will never come back. I make his conscience, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good reputation of his secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive arrangement, averse to associated with humorous literature, or contriving in any way to soften its pains, or add to its pressure. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finest feelings of his heart, so elegantly embedded in his secondary poems, seem to sit in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charm seem to spoil all his aesthetic; and his rest of loneliness is an additional reason that surrounds him as a being on which the listening religion has sealed itself, and on which Benevolence has thrown the bermant. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" feeling proud of him called a peasant. As far as both love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of the man; and the one who dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must happen.\nDear, only can censor the mistakes of another death. Lord Byron character is a worthy of genius bis. Doing good in secret, and the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virus....\nYour self-approved heart and consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "29": "A VAMPYRE:\nA Talo.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superposition on which his tole is based is very general in the East. Among the tho-Arabs, it seems to be a change: it has not, however, spread over the Greeks the establishment of Christianity; and it has only assigned its present form sirice tbe division of Lotin and Greek church; at that time, it became the prevalenl idol, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their terrier it increased gradually, and formed the subject of many wonderful slories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Avstria and Lorrainc, where belief existed, thal vampyres ignited at night a part surrounded by the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and died quickly oonsvmptioris; willst these greasy human blood-welders—and their bccamo velns distend such a state of reconciliation, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even of its pores very much of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is a curious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is supposed to have taken place in Madreyga in Hungary. It seems that at the exomination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the place, one misheard, five years earlier, that a certain Hoyduke, named Arnold Paul, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, had been tormented by a vampyre, that he had found a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the land of the grave of the vampyre, and that he had rubbed himself with bis blood. This precaution, however, did not warn hiin from becoming vampyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and buriol, the husbands seized to have been tormented by hjin, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of father by his attacks. To avoid other handkerchiefs, the inhabitants concentrated their Hadagni, took the body, and sound (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and flaccid blood. As the evidence was obtalized, they resolved to the occupied remedy. A stake leads entirely through the hoax and the body of Arriold Paul, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw the glasses into his grave. The same measures were adopted with dull courses of people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they, in turn, would become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, the use of because it seems better suited to lluster the subject of current observations than any other instaric that could be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to corrify his infernal visits only to those whom he loved most while he was on earth — those to whom he is bound by kinship and affliction. — An allowed to supposition in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, Your Corsica will come out of his tomb; then, haunting the native fold, and sucking the hood of all your race; from thence of your daughter, sister, wife, At night drain the flow of life; yet hate the banquet that is to feed the living course livid, Your victims, still exhale, Kriow the devil for their siro; As you cursed, you cursed them, Your flowers are full of spirit. But he who for your crime must fall. The youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop my heart like slame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last ring of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the last glass glitter must see who freezes 0' plus his lifeless blue; then, with the hand without hallowod extends 1 lear The braids of his hair yellow, of which, in life, a lock when shorn the most expensive commitment of the affective has been written — The bill is now carried away by the memorial of your agony! Yel with the best of his blood shall flow; thy gnashing tooth, and the lip of the hook; and hunting at the tomb, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rovc, until those in the horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Sotbey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire eorse 0s the Arab servant Oneiza, who is represented as having roamed from the grave for the purpose of tormenter, has better love whiest in existence. But this cannot be assumed to have resisted the sinfulness of his life, being pursued throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The real turn....\neffort gives a long run in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to say that he claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotos, and traditional riarratives illustrating its effects, put forth some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to exploitation, arid which can now 6 th concluded by simple romarking, that if the term Vampyre is that in general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, makes sense of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT was trotted in the first of the dissipations accompanying a London winter, it appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair attracted his attention, that he mhilled hy cl looking at calm, and throws fear into the breasts where thoughtlessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not see from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to write-up.\nTo be, and at one glance to pierce through the pierced work of the heart; but fell upon the cheek with a ray of lead that weighs on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; all the people who had dried him, and those who were accustomed to the rape exchange, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of enganging their attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her sace, which never slipped a lint of warrior, ei itr of the blushing modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, although her arid contours were beautiful, mary of the hunter after the notoriety tried to win her actions, and to win, at least, some mclrks of what they say affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters worn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw herself on the way, wave put everything except on the dress of a montebank, to attract her opinion :— although in vain :— when she stood before hlm, though her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were not seen ;— even her vnappal impudence was overflowed, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to the hive: yet, this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and the innate daughter, that few knew that he was ever speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it was overcome the drad of his Sirigular character, or that they were moved by his hatred apporient of vice, he was also often among those feinals who from the boast of their sex from toir virtues domestices, as among those who jostling her by their vices.\nAbout the same shot, a gentleman named Aubrey came to London: he has an orphan for fear of having one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to him by the guards, who thought that it was their duty to take care of the fortune jobs, while they took over the most important charge of his mind to the attention of the sea central successors, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, a high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins so many approximations of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with spiritual virtue, and thought that vice was thrown into hy Provldence simply for the picturesque flaw of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that misery of mercly consisted in the feeling of clothes, which were warm bone, but which were better suited to the eye of the doctor by irregular tigers and various colored patches. He thought, in the figure, that the dreams of poets deserved the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for this reason, on the bis that engulfs in the gay circle, many mothers surround him, trying to describe the least truth, their larguizing or grumpy favourites: the girls at the same time, by their dazzling faces as he approaches, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opens his lips, soon brings him to the madness of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to romance at his soletary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the prefence of a ghost, but to want af snvffing, there was no foundation in real life for any set of thal of pleasant photos and descriptions coincided in volumes xx, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, archever, some compensation in his gratified vanity, being about to relinquisb his dreams, where the extraordinary being that we described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observatory of oxternal objects, than tacit consent to existence, implied by the avoidance of their contract: allowing hif irnagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideaf, he formed this object in the hero or romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the man before him. He has become familiar with the back, has paid little attention, and so far has advanced on his notice, that his pronunciation has always been recognized. He found that Lord Ruthvens affairs were rebarafsed, and soon found the knot of preparation in — Slreet, till he was about to travel. Af desiring to obtain a certain incultation with regard to this singing character, which, until now, had on 1 y whented bis curiosity, he haunted his guardians, that it was time for him. This is a problem which, for many generations, has been the subject of constant reflection to allow young people to take a few red steps in the pillow of the vice, in order to make them available to the elderly, and not to allow them to appeal as if it were a fallen from the sky, whenever scandoleous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of appreciation or praise, according to the degree of skill they have been offered to carry. They spoke; and Avbrey immediately evoked his intellects to the Lord Rulhven, astonished to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a rnork that the estemm from him, who by chance had not hired in common with the men of the teacher, he willingly accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the winter waters.\nSo far, Aub really had not had the opportunity to study hard. The character of Ru hasn, and now he found, tot, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his product. His companion was protruded in his liberality ;— the child, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their imminetic desires. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that he was not insurmountable, reduced to indignation by the sick waitanl euen upon virtue, that he granted his alms ;—lbese were seized from the door of Tbe with sneezes barely removed; but when the prosligate came to ask something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink it up to 1 oep cr in his iniquity, who was dismissed by a rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, generally crucials about the retirement of the virtuous indigent. There was only one thing about charity of bis Lardship, which was still mortified by its spirit: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on it, because they were either led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject miscry. In Brussels and in other cities through the whip they passed, Aubrey was surprised to appear eagerly with his eomponion sought for Olls counters in vice fashion; there he entered into all the true spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played successfully, except where the best known was his Aritogonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but he always had the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or sat him without chance of a nurnerous family; then his vory desire seemed the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was lajd, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-mort mouse. In each towri, he left the old easy youth, torn up the circle in the head, cursed, iri the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this friend; while many father sat small, in the midst of the splattering appearances of children hungry for mule, without one end of his last immense wealth, where even with bruying sufficed to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, at the ruirier of the rnany, the last gold that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but it could result from a degree of certain knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to resign from this barbarity and pleasure which caused the ruin of all, the cold did not have for his own benefit ;— but he delayed it — for the same day, he hoped that his friend would give him the same opportunity to speak-\nBut, it happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke of the levets than his lip; arid though Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not get more grateful about him than the constant excitation of vainly wanting to break this mystery, which to exalt the imagination began to absorb the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon buried themselves in Romo, and Aubrey lost time to see his companion; he left him every day sitting in the morning circle of an Italian country, as he went in search of the mothers of another almost deserted city. Wbilst was thus erupted, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing only the affliction; the others, from her guardians, amazed him; if he had before interested in the imagination that there was evil power in his company, these feelings gave him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insist on his immediate leave....\ndriving his friend, and urged that his sanctity was terribly vicious, for the possession of an irresistible power of seduction, made his fiendious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adulterer had not been born of his character; but he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratitude, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, be driven from the pinacea of unwelcome virtue, to the western abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the femas that had been sought, apparent to their virtue, had, since his departure, cast the mask itself, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their victims to the public gaze.\nAubrey dissuaded leaving one character who rioted but showed a single bright spot a while to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon him together, to purge, in the sense, to look at him more obscenely, and not to let pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, who was weakening above all. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; so he was forced to keep bjs plclns iri secret; but Aubreys eye followed hiin in all its windings, and soon discovered that the ari assignment had been pointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Without the lime, he entered Lord Ruthveris apartment, and abruptly asked Bim his intentions with respect to the lady, forming him at the same time as he was aw are to his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that the intentions of the bis were such that he assumed all that you would have had on such a casual; and after being in a hurry if he wanted to marry him, was content with laughing. Aubrey withdrew, and, immediately writing a note, to say that from that moment, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lody, the information of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. This assignment has been prepared. Lord Ruthven the following day merely sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a solution; but did not have any suspicion of his having plan was thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Tube peninsula, sounding in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to trace the faded traces of ancient glory on the mountains which apparently, shameful to frighten the acts of the free only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that it might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the pinain, or trippod along the side of the mountain, a world thought the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for the luxurious aspect lhatsleepy of the animal adapted but to the light taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrcy in his fear after antiquities, and often the fiery girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmere, buzzing all the beautiful of his form, floating as it was on the wind, to the one eagerly circle of him, who forgot the letters that he had deciphered on a tablet erased cells, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her braids would fall, as she flattered around, would expose in the ray of the sun of Tbe so delicately bright and quickly fade away, he might well excuse the oblivion of the anliquary, which allowed this mind to escape the very object that he had before thinking of the vital importer to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pousanias. But why try to describe charms that any feel, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocent, youthful and beautiful, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating rooms. While hedrew stayed for a memorial for her future hours, she stood by, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes at her place of origin; she would then describe her waxing dance on the open plain, painted to him in all the following colors of youngful menory, the marriage pump she remembered having seen in her information; and then, turning to the evil subjects made a greater impression on her mind, told her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her sincerity and apparent belief in what she was telling, exciled the irilest eueri of Aubrey; and she often told at home the story of the living varpyr, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and of the dearest tios, forced each year, feeding the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the next manths, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe vilified her with the dwarfs of old men, who had at last dictated a life among them. After many of their close arid children had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when she made him hear so unbelieving, she begged him to believe that she, sor, had been noticed that the thosc that horded their existence, had always had given evidence, which forced him to confess and to break his heart. Sbe detailed to him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his boundor was increased, hearing a precise prelty deserption of the Lord Rutbven; however, he still persisted on the porsuading, that lerc could not be any truth in his fears, tuangb at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to oxcite cl belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to Him; his inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he sought his vision of romance, won his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without education, he found himself increasingly attached to the almost magical foreign before him. At times he was tearing himself from her, arid, forming a plan for an antiquarian resurgence, he went away, decided not to return until her object was amalgamated; but he still found it impossible to fix his attentori on the ruiris around bim, while in his mind he kept a shot image seemed alorie to the rigid possessor of his rights. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and always was the healthy childish francilc being that he had known for the first time. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him, but she did so because she no longer had anyone with whom she could afford her favorite clothes, while her tutor was busy using a sketch or burying a fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of Vampyres, they both, with several presents, confirmed their ex-isterice, pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to pursue on an of his excursians, who had to hold him for a few hours; who they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him to riot your turn at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of vampy trees in their night orgies, and bare the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at their laughter; but when he saw the infancy shudder at his audacity to mock a punctual, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his nawaited excursion; he was surprised to serve the melancholy face of his host, and was worried to find his words, mocking the life of these horrible afflictions, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his breast, and earnestly begged him to come back, and by the night passed, the power of these bearings was put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the day-Iight would end so, and that in the horlzon there was one of the tase spots which, in the warmer climates, quickly got into a tremble mass, and shed their rage on consecrated the country .— He finally counted his horse, however, determined to moke up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. Twilight in these southern climates...\nhe is almost known; immediately the sunset, the night begins: and he had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his thundering echoes had barely a resting inlervalent — his heavy heavy rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seems to fall radial clrid at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with speed dredged through the entangled forest. Finally, the animal, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that he huddled in the vicinity of a hoof that rose from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrate, be approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city of Tobe, or at least trust to get shelter from the stormpelling. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the shouts of a woman who mixed herself with the suffocating and exulting mockery of laughter, continued to hear the sound almost intact ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden erasure, shook the door of the hut. He found himself in darkness: sound, hasever, guided them. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, until the contagious sounds, the ironic rioted from him. He found himself in corruption with an ori, which he immediately got drunk; when a voice cried out :\"Again basfled!\" to which a loud laugh succeeded; and he felt struck by the one whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as hard as he could, he struggled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted from his feet and thrown with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on him, and threw himself on his breech, had put his hedges high in his throat ;— to be instantly dared, and, the prey, rushed through the door, and into a mother the crushing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were without. They entered; the light of the torches of their fell on the walls of the mud, arid then thatched washed on each individual straw with heavy salt flakos. At Aubreys desire, they sought her who had drawn him to his cry; he was ogairi for fear of being in the darkness; but what was his stalker, when the blade of the torches burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a corsus of life. He closed his eyes, hoping that he was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, stretched out on his side. There was no colour on the cheek, not even on his lip; yet, the there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived here :— on his neck and chest was blood, and even his throclt were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, simultaneouslylystruok with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A little was quickly formed, and Aubrey was placed next to the hcr who was recently to him the subject of so many brilliant visions and fairies, now fermented with the defect of life that had died in her. He didn't know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and ignited to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacation, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular consluction, which had been four in the cabin. They were quickly met by different two parties who had been involved in the search for her that an annuitant had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, pushed the parents of a draconian catastrophe. \"Décrire like a girl would be impossible; but when they lost the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable, both made a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and well often delirious; in these intervals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthc—by sure an unaccouritable combination he seemed to be begging his training companion to spare the being he loved. At the time, he impregnated maldices on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from the whatever motif, screaming from the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant assistant. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified on the start of the one whose image he now hid combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, impliedirigaThe greatest repentance for the fault that had caused their exasperation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with his present. His seigneury seemed quite careful; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew again into the lazy state of mind, and Aubrey pierceived no difference from the old man, excepl than at timos he was surprised to meet this game fixed intensely hlm, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was anxiously committed to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elostia of the spirit that once had so distinguished it now seemed to him to have fought forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but although he desired solitude, his spirit could not find him in the district of Atbons; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly he turned the rougir, showing himself, to his wild imagination, his foe pain and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each of which shine created such bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Steven, to whom he was stunned by the mowing care he had taken badly from him during his life, which the parts of Groece had not yet seen. They searched in every direction, and searched for every place to which a memory could be attached; but so they bathed from one point to another, but they seemed rioting to take into account what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which were in fact the iritation of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity they defended against the so-called dangers. As a result of neglecting the advice of the jnhabitans, they traveled with only a few guards, more also served as a guide and as a defense. On entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a lorrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the precipices nelghbouring, had a reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly any party engaged in a narrow collar, when they were bewildered by the whistling of bullets near their heads, and by the ratio echoed with several rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the tower of cover of the defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who with insati It Cree bye them advances, arid heating exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should climb up and take the cm to the back, they decided once set forward in the scarf of the enernia. They had barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthveri received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to be asphyxiated; and, without worrying about evil or his own peril, he was soon surprised by shaking the brigands' saces around him — the guards of Hjs having, upon Lord Ruthven being wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they simply kept the trance until their command blushed with the promised sum, for which he had an organ. Lord Ruthvens strength decreased considerably; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with rushed tumults. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the objects surrounding him: but towards the closto of last night, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, what was it that he was to quench the help with more bitterness than usual —\"Assist me! I do not interfere with my life. I observe the death of my experience as a day of flight; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I could have done anything ,\" replied Aubrey. e :\" need. but I need — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you want to control everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — on whether my death was unknown for some time in England — I— but life. \"—\"He is not known. \"Swear !\" cried the man dying, rising up with exultant violence ,\"say ye that for a year and a day ye shall not pass on your knowledge of my crimes or delights to every living being in an arduous manner, whatever happens, or what ye see not. \" His eyes seemed to be blushing with these socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, laughing, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many scholars who attended his knowledge of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold shower came upon him, as if the prefecture of horrific something was waiting for him. Arise early in the morning, he is about to enter the above iri whincb that he had left the corpse. When Arobber met him, arid made him say that it was no longer threshing, bavjng was transported by himself and the comrades, on this retjring, for the pinacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they had given to his seigneury, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey was surprised, and hit several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot where he was. But, when he had ascended to the light, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, the thinkho thieves sworn that they indicated the identical rock on which they put the body of Tbe. For a spirit of fire, bis was perplexed, but he finally fled, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a stream in which he had encountered such trouble misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for the money to him, your Torarito, or in Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of the pipe he had given him to extend to Lard Ruthven. Among the other cases, there have been several cases of offences, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dangers and attacks. If one looks at their curious forms, the whale was surprised to find a shoathap apparently eaten in the same style while the dagger discovered in the fatal hut—he murmured—takes the proof of the gajn surther, the faunted tube weapon, clings to his horror can be imagined when he dispossessed that she made, although specially shaped, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; to bumble the particular shape, the different shades of the healthy on the haft and the kealh were as well as spleridaur on both, and not to leave no room without doubt; there were drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady who had tried to capture Lord Rulhvens seductive arts. Her parents found themselves in distress, the thorium was ruined, and she had not been heard since her secretary broke apart. Aubrey's mind almost broke under so many reported borbors; he was afraid that this lady had caused a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became inorose and silent; arid his only occupation was to bury the speed of the postings, as if he were going to save the life of someone he loved. He arrived in Calais; a breeze, who seemed to obey his will, soon made a call to the English short; and he hastened to the manslan of his fat fat, arid there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the herbrace and caresses of his sisler, all the memory of the past. If previously, by infantine bear caresses, she had acquired the basic effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey did not have this winning grace that wins the look and applause of the assemblies of the drawer room. There was none of this lightness that existed over 1 y in the heated almosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never raised by the beauty of the mind below. There was a cbarm melancholy on this subject which did not seem to be born of malfartune, bvt brake something into, that appeared to indicate a sovl conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could hang, it was sedative and pensive. When alone, her face is lightened by the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence, those claws that she knew destroyed her rest, who would have exchanged the horrible smile for the oluplars one? It seemed that those eyes — that face then played in full light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It was thought that by her guardians made that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now decided that the next show, which was approaching the most, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey daughter stayed in his father's house, and fed melancholy, which dominated him. He could not feel intimidated by the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind was so torn by the event that he had witnessed; but he discouraged the sacrifice of his own comfort to the prefecture of his sister. They soon came to Lown, and prepared for them the next day, which had been arranged as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had been held rioting for a long time, and all who were impatient with the bask on the kingship smile, hastened there. Bob Rey was there with his sister. While he was sinking into a corner by himself, without taking into account everything around him, Iri the memory of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven wos in that same place there --he himself --self---remember your oath. He was barely...\nage to turn, fearing to see a spectrum that would explode it, which he picinated, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn his opinion on this place upon his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost saw him carrying their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and was a house driver. He trampled the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands back on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would faint from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began to dreadful arroy — the dagger — his oath .— He woke up, cannot believe it — death rises again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore discouraged going again into society; because although he tried to ask if it was Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few laughs later with his sister to try the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving his wife the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many of them were greedy, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister enraged by many, apprehensively in a carnetic conversation; he tried to pass through and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he had the most horror. And he went forth, and put on his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, forced her toward the street; and at the door, he found himself hindered by full-bodied osservants waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :«Remember your oath !\" He dared not turn, but, rushing over, soon grated to the house.\nAubrey almost got dislocated. If, before, his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more complete...\nThe certainty of the monster's life has continued to grow on the blue thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what led to her abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and Ihose terrified him. The gold he bought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was it then to roll this monster, carrying his breath upside down, in the midst of all that he was holding up, and not to abort his progress? Maybe his sister was a weary by him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he rebukes, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in the state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, that there were eyes full of tears, begging Him, for his good, to sustain nature. Lost, no capable of the danger of darkness and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to the street, anxious to steal the tall image that haunted him. His dress has become unexpected, and he wanders, as often exposed to midday fun as at midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening at the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disconcerted by him who fled from a chaser-thari any — from thought. His conduct, however, changed suddenly. Struck by the idea that he rented all his friends, with a proud among them, by his abseno, of a house presence that they were unconscious, he determined again in society, and looked at him closedly, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthuen approached with intimacy. But if he entered a room, his discontented eyes were so striking, his inner trembling so incomprehensible, his sister was obsessed for the last time to beg to abslain to seek, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, in truth, the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to interfere, and, fearing that his mind was engulfing alienated. However, they have time to refute again that confidence that had risen before imposing on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesirovs to save him from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered in his wclriderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye these marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to the resident in the house, and constantly took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency was so great that he was confined to his hammock. There, it was often 1 time for days, unstickable to be shaved. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— Ibe only a sign of affection and memories remained shown from the rushes at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that grieved him, he deceived her so as not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love is far from me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was talking to, her only answer was ,\"Truly! True !\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: gradual, however, over the course of the year, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw off a part of his goal, while his guards observed that several shots in the day he would colunl upori his fingers a certain numbness, and the smile lhen.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, a hls guardian bone entering his room, beg a doctor to converse with bis about the melancholic circumstance of Aubreys being in so horrible a situation, when his sister was going the next day to get married. Aubrey attention was instantly drawn; he asked...\nWhose that? Glad that this brand came back as indelect, from which they saw behad being private, they mentioned the name of Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by his expression of his intonation to be pre-\nsent to the nuptials, arid dressing to see his sister. They did not answer, but in some nuts, his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his brevity, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive for the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and arduous accomplishment; when suddenly to be Pereived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what his surprise saw the characteristics of the monster that had so long influenced his life. Hesei 2 made the portrait in a cleavage paroxysm, and trampled him under his feet. In asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he threw as if he did not understand her, then took hold of her hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of face, he made her swear that she would never marry that moron, far from being — but he could not accuse him — it seemed that this voice had again hurt her to remember his o ath — he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the arid doctor took guardians, who had heard the whale, and thought it was only a return of his disorder, entered, and forced her from Miss Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees, yours, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, fond of the madness they imagined, took possession....\nIon of his spirit, considered to plcify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been relieved with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood him the cause of this; but when he learned that he was considered infallible, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be exempted from those among whom he had heard. He hastened to evoke his former companion, and, by constant constancy, and the pretension of great affection for him and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and things to be met—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with those whom he addressed to himself ;—could know how, if he knew her, her existence, bad began to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the integer of the Serpent, or such was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. As the title of the elder branch fell at length to hjm, he forgot an embassy of importarit, which served as an excuse sor that stretching the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAuhrey, when left by the physician and his guardians, tried to bribe his servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and the paper; it was given to him; he put himself in the honor of a letterer to his sister, corrupting the beer, as if one valued his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once held in their arms as their arid hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which the heaviest curses were denounced. The servants promised they would deliver it; but giving it to the doctor, he preferred no longer harassing Miss Aubrey's mind by, what he informed, greasing of a mariaque. The night assailed without rest to the occupied inrnates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a trot of horror can more easily be designed to describe, the notes of occupied preparatian. Morning came, and the sound of the cartage broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up in a frantic almost. Finally, the nurturing of the servants overcame vigilance, they graduated from abandonment, leaving hiding in the custody of an old impotent woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, and at the moment found himself in the apartment where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthveri was the first to perceive the bim: back immediately approached, and, taking arms by force, hurled from the room, speechless with fury. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if she is not my fiancée today, your sister is discriminated. The women are fragile !\" He said ,\"He threw him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek him .\" Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his rage, not finding ventilation, had braked a blood vessel, and he was transformed into a bed. It was not a reception for his sister, who was not present at his entrance, because the doctor feared shaking him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and the bride left London.\nAbbreys weakness has worsened; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He disdained his sister's guardians, and on the evening of midnight he had struck, told in a composite way that the reader could peruse, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, he was too late. Both. Ruthven had disapproved, and Aubrey sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was set in motion by him, where to choose this place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN A sail across the Greek archipelago, on the edge of one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of this name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables that must always be found, force many British ships to visit it, both warm and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums fully reimburse the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bay jacket, and the men began to water, and they negotiated with the natives, the ecclesiastical, and myself, walking on the cave of the Homer school, and on the other, where we had already had the opportunity. On the front of Mouril Ida (a small monticulo so named) we met and erected a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come to Fronder Scio with a Lord English, who left the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \" He hired me as a pilot, said the Greek, and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mjtylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and hc left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, tbe wine-trader, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 25 o English coin ,) and rcside thore about fourteeri month, although only constantly; for he fails in his felucca very often to the various islands .\"\nThis account has excited us very much, and we have not wasted time hastening the house where our bad countryman was residing. We were kindly received by an old inon, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the first floor: a room of eritrice, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spoky closet and annexed. They are all simply decorated: green-green waltzes, marble tablays on either side, a mystery of barley in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play your game through the brariches by moving a six-point source on the side of a small bro named Venus in a lean posturo; a large sofa or sofa completes the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookhouse: there were rio mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed in all the green. In the starting room, we observed a marble recreation, formerly, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a box of large sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the cannons. On the lbo tablet of the insert rest Vo literature, Shakespeare, Boileav, and Rousscau complete works; Volney's R uins of Empires; Zimmerman, in German tho language; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Mollons Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, prayed to Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press club Constantinople, much torn, but no book in English of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with a brief of paper, on which the class were remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The first lord read these books in the evening before he was told, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they had to go back there until his return; for it is so special that if I moved once a third without order, he would frown me a week in a row; it is otherwise very good. I have once done a service; and I hate the product of this farm for the trophe of the language of him, except for twenty cchinis which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the house was absolutely pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty inches long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and moss work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, walls covered by a fine Turkish carpet, under an awning of coarse strong lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surpassed, as on the cm, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we buried the hovse, a small brook glidod oway, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on the edges of the jls, and under the shade of two large bush blues, where the marble seat with an ornamental wooden back was placed, on which we said, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, wiling, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old husband ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he was always attached to the church of the ovary twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what we might call \"a bird view\". A line of rich viricyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with living trees and myrtlc in flowers, and on the summit, whose Greek temple of anticieritis appeared in the inajeftic decomposition. A small stream that came out of the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the mountain house. The sea of Tho smooth as glass, on a horizon not swept by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a view of lofty teeth and palm trees, several small islands were observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful as to the name of the persori who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew this dwarf but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" exclaimed our conductor ,\" Could he say so, but I am sure he won ,\"–\" And can you be such an old sling ?\" \"If I can,\" said to him ,\" I don't dare .\" We had the time of riots for the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several parliculars of the isolated lord. He had worn eight youngs when he was last on the island, and even drew them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He also bought a new ball for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testclmonts to the children's poor. In short, it has appeared to us, from all that we have collocated, to have been a very eccentric and honed character. A circumstance that we learn, whip our old friend at the cottage, deemed appropriate do not discuss. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the word was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought a piano-strong, and he himself had learned how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we expelled from the island of Mitylene of peace; our imaginations all about the rack, guessing that this library in Greece could be. He had money that it was empty: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark the particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the camp with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greeec ,\"The individual,\" he exclaimed ,\"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trip on the land of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene .\" We had then heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. We deeply regret that not having been more curious about our research at the tho cottage, but we have oonsolated our lives with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a future day; but in that day, neuer return. I make this statement, believing that he is not uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his secretary, which was grossly slandered. He was described as a urifeolising arrangement, deafened himself to humiliation, or contributed in some way to appease his pains, or to add to his plaidsuros. The focus is dioctically the roverse, as can be collected by plairily from these little anecdolos. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their seated in his home. The ardour, sympathy, and sheerness seem to guide the actions of 1 l hjs; and his wrath of madness is an additional reason to mark him as a being on the heart, because the Halh religion has put his seal, and on whose head Benevalence has cast his coat. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" by feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume an opinion to go. The reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and the one who decres ustily himself before that terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in the dry, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and the consequence of approval.\nTHE END!\nGift, Printer, Crown-colour, Fleet-street.",
    "30": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition on which this college is founded so very generally in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be comman: it did not extend, however, to the Greeks until they swelled the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at the time, the idea of becoming practising, that a Latin body could not corrupt if drunk in their torritory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonders, still existing, from the dead rising from other tombs, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variance, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there were beliefs, that vampyres at night irritated a certain part of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost the strength of their, and died quickly of convomptions; while these human wood suckers were fattening — and their venom became distended to such a state of repletion, bone to causo the blood to sink from call the passages of the bodies of lheir, and even the pores themselves of their skin.\nOn the London Day, March 1723, is a curious and, in cases of curse, credible account of a particular case of vampyrifm, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in the Hungory. It seems that, on an examination of the commander-in-chief of the place, the magistrates, posiliously and unanimously confirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been moored by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, by eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampyr, and rubbing himself at his blood. This prediction, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, on the statement of the call was mado, but four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malice, the iris inhabitants who consulted their Hadagni, took the body of TB, and ring it (as it is assumed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting a mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they joined the usual remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, to which it is said that he was scattered as sadly as if he had been alive. And they cut his head off, and burned his body, and cast the glasses into his cloud. The same measures were adopted with regard to the course of people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that, in the case of terror, they would become agents on top of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a coworker, and sucks in his time.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems better suited to lluster the subject of the observations present than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after the death, for an odious orime committed during its existence, that the deceased is not only designed to vampyrise, but ompled to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by family affection .— A supposition olluded to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre fent, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; thenghastly haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all by roce; there of lhy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight drain the streom of life; yet hate the banquet that performeth shall feed thy ivid corsus; thy victims, be they exhale, shall know the demori for their sire; As ye curse, lhucvrsing them, Thy flowers are wilted upon the stem. But he who, for your crime, must fall, The young boy, the best of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! Yel Thov puts an end to your task and marks the last tint of his cheek – the last spark of his eye, and the glassy gaze lost must view Who freezes over the blue lifeless; Then with the hand without Halloween shail tears The braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when shorn Most tender disorder plcdge has been worn—But now is carried away by this Memoricll of your agony! And the best blood shall flow; thy tooth of gnachirig, and thy lip of thug; and threshing at the tomb of tby sullen, Go, and with Gouls and Asrits rave, until the thcse in boundor shrinks awcly of a more covered spectrum than they.\nSouthey baf also presented in his wild but magnificent poem of \"Tbalclba\", the vampire curse of the good Arobian Onoiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave for the purpose to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But this criminal riot is supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of her life. She was paurtrayed throughout the tole as a complete type of purlty and innocence. The uerclous Tournefort gives a long amount in his journeys of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness ari; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and traditional tales illustrate of his effects, put down fortb some dissertations learned, overturning to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMclny curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and whoh rnay riow be concluded by simply remclrking, that if the Vampyre lerm is one in the most general acceleration, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in various ports of the world: like Vrocol0cha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucaloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a noblernan appeared to the various parties of the town leaders, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He raised the mirth of sounds, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the scout of the fairly only stirred his attention, so that he could by a look quill, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this sense of fear could not explain that he was getting up: some attributed him to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the core of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a single glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities made Hiin invited to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, attaching now the weight of boredom, carried happiness to having something in their presence able to engage their attentiveness. Despite the dead tint of the face, which never won a warmer time, either from the buffoon of the modestinity, or from the strong emotion of passion, kill its shape and the oullinc were beautifullfu 1, many more nottied female hunters tried to gain his attention, and gairi, at least, some marks of what they migrated to the term of affection: Lody Mercer, who was badly the trick of every monster in the drawing rooms since his marriage, threw himself in his way, arid did everything but pvt on the dress of cl montebonk, to attract his attention :— when she slipped in front of him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were not seen ;— even her unapplied impudence was low, and she raised the field. But although common adultery could never influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the semel sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to his virtuous wife and iriocente daughter, few knew that he was ever speaking to himself to females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and that it was that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were involved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was also often among these women who forms the boast of their sex of their dome --\nthe virtues tick, as among those who push them through the values of drinking.\nAbout the same time, he came to London, a young gentleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with one sister in the possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was in eternity. Left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they blamed the most important charge of his mind in the custody of the sub-alturns mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, a sense of honor and frankness, high romantic, which every day ruins so many milliners of concepts. He believed to sympathize with the virtuo, and he thought that the music was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effeot tip of the scene, as seen in the romances: he thought that the miferie of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of eliothes, which were like the worm, but which were better suited to the eye of the animeux by their irreguable folds and various colored patterns. He thought, in the end, that the poet's dream was the realities of life. Ho was beautiful, devious and rich; for these fools, when he entered gay circles, many others surrounded him, striving to describe the least truth, their languishing or blushing savoriles: the girl at the same time, enlightening the counterials as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him into false nolons of his talents and his mority. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was just started to find, shot, except in the candles of tallow and wax that slipped, born of the presence of a ghost, but srom lacks snuffling, there was not the basis in real life for any of these congreries of photos and descriptions of plisiririg contained in lhose volumes, from which he had formed his studies. By finding, however, some compensation in its gratified variety, it was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary behavior we have above disordered, made him pass into the career of this.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the cbclracter of an entiroly man absorbed in herself, which gave little sigrian other of his observation of external objects, that tacit assent to the existence of tbeir, implicitly by tbe adance of their contact: allowing his iinogination to imagine e very tbing that flattered c propensity to extirvagant ideas, he soan formed this object in tho hero af a rornance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He has become familiar with him, calmed his attention, and so far has advanced to his opinion, that the presence is always recognized. He gradually suggested that Lord Ruthven's business was embarrassed, and soon discovered that he was about to travel. Desiring to win a certain computeriori respecting this singular character, which, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for bim to make the tour, which for the bridegroom generations low be believed necessary to allow the young to take some fast pieps in the care of vice-lowards setting up an equality with the elderly, and rioting allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sky, when intrigues scondals are begden as subjects like pity or praise, according to the degree of competence he had in the realization of these ones. They consented; and Aubrey immediately mingled with his intentions with Lord Steven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, which apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he readily accelerated it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nHlthcrlo, Aubrey had no contribution to studying Lord Ruthvens character, and now he found that, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent reasons for conducting bis. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the idlc, the vagabond, and the beggar, regenerated with the hand bis plus lhan enough to relieve their immediate needs. Bul Aubrey could not help but point out that it was a riot on a uirtuous tube, reduced to judigence by the missorlones, even on virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to make his desires ring, bul to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his inquity, he was sent away with rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which comes grievingly on the bashfulness retreat of the virtuous needy. Tberc wos and circumstances about the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed on her mind: all those upon that it was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scaffold, ouvnk to the lowest and most abiect misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the appearance with which his companion sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; he entered there in the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always with suoces, except where the best known was in the throes of his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he spoiled; but it was always with the changing face of the samo vn, that he usually dragged society: it was however a riot, so much so that he discovered the eruption young ful nouice, or the unlucky father of a large number of family; their very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent characteristic of the spirit was a help apart, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city he left an easy youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, in the folly of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him without the reach of this fund; while many father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of more hunger children, without a single farlhing of his late immense wealth, where to buy even enough to sit-\nThat is why we have decided to go further. He does not look like money from the game table of Tbe; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guard he had just pulled from convulsive to the take of the innocent: this could but be the reverence of a certain knowledge agreement, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Avbrey often wanted you to represent him to his sling, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the origin of all, and did not make his own profit ;— but he dilated it — for every day he kissed a friend who gave him an opportunity to speak to him frankly and openly; to bow, it never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car laughs, and almost the wild variety and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained a greater attainment of it than the constant excitation of vainly wishing to break lhatmystery, which to his imaginative exaltity began to tighten the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, along Aubrey for a lost time sigh of his companion; leaving him in a gentle presence on the snoring circle with an Italian ointment, if he went in search of the memorials of the deserted city of another almost. While he was thus engaged, letters came snoring England, that he opened the impatience of the Twitter; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had previously engaged in his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insist on his immediacy leaving his friend, and urged that his character was terribly victims, because the possession of irresistible powers, bones seduction, made his false habits harder dangerous to silk. It had been discovered that his contempt for the adviser had not arisen in the hatred of the character; but that he had demanded, in spite of his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, had raised himself from the pinnacle of the uriculate uritus, to the lowest abyss of the infamous arid degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of the virtue of the air, had finished his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the decformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single right point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a precious pretext for abandoning him completely, by seeking, by means of it, to monitor him more closely, and not to allow any light circumstances to pass. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that the boss Lordship was trying to work on the experience of the daughter of the lady whose house was chicfly frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was forced to wear his plan in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been applied, which would the most end of the ruin of innocent Ari, though a tiny girl. Not losing time, entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and earnestly asked her with respect to the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of her being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven opposed his internions, which he all believed to have on such an occasion, and after being prostrated if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say that, from that moment, he must decide....\nBy accompanying her Lordship in the leader of their proposed visit, he ordered her sergeant to look for apartments, and called the lady's mother, the uniformé hor of everyone knew, riot only with regard to her daughter, but also concerning the ch aracter of her Lordship. The assignment of the will be prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to riot his complete consent to a separation; but did not imply that he suspected that his plans had been defiled by the intersection of Aubrey.\nhaving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed the residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the erased documents of ancient glory on the monumerites which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of the free only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many cursed lichens. Under the same roof, there was a being, so beautiful and so delicate, who had formed the model for a painter wanting to spread on canvas the promised hope of faithful in Mohammed paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit so that one could think that she could belong to those who had no faults. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the moritaine, we would have the gazelle a poor kind of its beauties; for those who would exchanged the eye bear, apparently the eye of the animated nature, the luxurious storm the drowsiness aspect of the suitable animal but to taste of an epic. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrey in his search for aster antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmcre hutterfly, brandished all the beauty of his shape, flaling as he was on the wind, for ga2e avid to him, who forgot the letters he had just decrypted on a tablet almost effaced, in contemplation of his sylph-like figure. Many of her braids would fall, as she flirted around, would expose in the ray of the sun so bright delicately and quickly erase Hucs, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who escapes from his theoretical object spirit that he had before thinking of the vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why tries to describe the charms that everyone feels, no one can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, arid beauty, vaunted by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating the ball. He drew the remains of those which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she would stand by, and with the magic effect of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe him the dance circling upan the plain operari, would painting, to him in all the flamboyant colors of the youthful memory, the pomp of marriage which she remembered to look in her irony; and then, turning to thal subjects had evritly mado a greater impression on ber mirid, would leave him all the surnatural tales of his nurse. And often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the dearest tlcs, before each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at her by so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the names of old men, wbobad ot dictated one living clmongself, after several of their relatives relative and children had found Markod with tbe sta mp of his appetite; and when he had found him so unbelievable, she was begged to believe herself, for he had been, romarcqué, that those who had darod to question their existence, always bad evidence given, and that he forced them, with grief and heh, the blindness was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, arid bis borror was incrusted, by the pillowrig a rather precise description of the Lord Rulhven; however, he again harassed by persuading her, that there could not be truth in his fears, although at the same shot he wondered about the many coincidences that all tended to excite a belio in the adrenal power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected by the coming of the women he had sought for his vision of romance, gained his heart bis; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a uriated Greek girl, he still found lusci more and more attached to the almost fai ry form before hiin. He sometimes ripped himself, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, decided not to return until his ohiect was reached; but to be always found it is impossible to fix his attention upon the ruins the arourid, wbilst in his mind he kept an image that seemed alone the good possessor of bis thought. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could screw her favorite haunts, while her guardian was occupied in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped from the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, engaged they both, with several present, confirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey determined to make one or his excursions, which had to hold a bim for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at once begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after the day had closed, upon any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in the night orgies of the lheir, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on him to darcdto crossing their way. Aubrey made the light of their representatives, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring test to mock a superper, an infernal power, he was very named whose clappeargent chewed their blood wiped, to be silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excursiori unattended; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was designed to see that his words, motivating the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such a story. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, arid seriously begged him back, the night was allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he saw that the light of the day was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warm climates, gather so quickly in a huge mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted country .— He finally, however, stripped up the hif borse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but it was too late. Twilight, in the southern climates, is almost naked; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had already advanced far, the power of the storm was above — his lubricated echo had barely a resting interval — his heavy heavy rain forced his woy through the foliage of lacanopyjng, while the forked blue lightning shone to fall and radlate at his own feet. Suddenly, his horse was scared, and he carried with a terrible speed through the tangled forest. The animal at least, through fatigue, stopped, arid, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least rely on getting shelter on the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams that a woman mingled with suffocated mockery, exultating a laugh, continued in an almost intact smile ;— ho was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut to panic. He found himself in total darkness: this sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unaware of it, because, although he called, the sounds were still contrived, and no opinion was taken of him. He found blmself iri contact with someone, whom he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out :\"Again baffled!\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught hy whose strength is seenmod superhumari: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, hls seen and thrown with a huge force against the ground :— his enemy threw hjm himself on him, held on his knees on his chest, had placed hls hands at the top of his throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating through the hole which gave light in the day, shook him ;— he had incorruptibly risen, arid, leaving his prey, precipitated by the door, and in a mumcnt the crushing of the branches, as he broke through blue wood, had no longer heard. The storm was now silent; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered; the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatch of the tob loaded on each individual straw with heavy soft flakes. In the desire of Avbrey, they sought her, who had caught her, her cries; he was again left in darkness; and what was her horror, when the light made her once more to push the torches, to perpetrate the aerial form of her beautiful conductor, brought a course without life. He shouted his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he swallowed them, stretching by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was an above ber face that seemed almost as attached as the thal of life that once lived there :— on his neck and braisl wall blood, and on his throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A Company !\" A litter was quickly bewitched, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of visions so many and so brilliant, now fallen with the flower of the life that was bad died in her. He knew that he had not been beaten with bis — his mind was inflamed and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were sororent by the various parties who had engaged in the search for her, which the mother had missed. Their lamentations shouted, as they approached the city, they advanced to the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be irreplaceable; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the correct .\" They were inconsonable; both died in the heart of the broken.\nAvbrey being put to bed was seized with a violent foam fever, and waf often delicious; in the Lhesian inlorvals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by an unpleasant bo combination seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. To other times, he imprecises the curses on his head, the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Atheris, and, for whatever reason, upon the audition of the lecture of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and begged his constant attendant. When he recovered from his deljrium, he was borrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image is now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving alinosta repentonce for the sin that had used their separation, and slill more by the attentiori, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence bis. His sentence seems completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescence threatened to be repatriated, he gradually withdrew to the same state of India, and Avbrey did not pierce any difference from the former man, except that he was sometimes in fury to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. Driving the last stage of the recovery of the irivalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves without tidal rasod by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the sun without movcless ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was much troubled, arid this elasticity of mind that the evil ancestors so distinguished today seemed to run away. He was now as in love with solitude and solitude as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athenf; if he sighed him in the midst of the ruins which he had once fried, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he would lock him in the woods of Tbe, his slight step would seem wandering in the middle of the underwood, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, to his wild imagination, his pale and frantically fervent face, he smiled on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all the seams of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he held him bound by the tender heart who had taken from him during his misfortunes, that they fled the parts of Greece or the child still seen. They traveled in all directions, and looked for all the places where a rocolion could be attached; but they rushed from one place to another, but they did not let themselves listen to what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result of not taking into account the advice of the inhabitants, one occasion, they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than defense. When entering, however, in a narrow layer, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks scrambled by the practices of the area, they had the reason to repent of their religligence; for hardly the whole party entered the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle balls near their head, and by the choed ratio of several cannons. In such a situation, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, they had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating the example of Thoir, withdrew for a mother behind the turning sheltered from defilement: but assailed to be so detained by an enemy, wbo with insulting cries made them advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers should grimpabve and take them back, they decided in fact to rush forward in search of the enemy. Hardly, they had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot from the shoulder girl, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, without a long concern about the contest or his peril, he was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his having guards, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately conned his arms.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged the redhead to convince his friend to a nearby cabrin; and, having accepted a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were merely consciously to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had ordered ari. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed.\ned; he seemed of unconscious of pain as he had been objects to aboul him: bvt towards the closure of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with more than usual solicitation —\" Help me! You can love me — you can do more than that — I don't remember my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the day of passing; but you can save my book, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. e :\" need a little, I can explain the whole, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free from standing in the mouth of the world, and if my death disappoints a little like in England, I — but lift it. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up violently ,\"Swear by the mad soul, by all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to the living party being in any way, what can happen, or what you can see. \" His eyes seemed to be bursting with Ihère socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he lay one stroke on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey retired for resl, but did not sleep; the circumstances rnany attending his accarirance with this husband rosc on his mind, and he knows not when he remembered that he was swearing that a cold frenzy was approaching the back, as if, from the present, something horrible was waiting for him. He got up early in the morning, and was unable to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief informed him that he was no longer there, having been passed on by himself to encumbered comrades, to his retreat, to the pinnaele of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, that he could be exposed to the first ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes more and more men, dissuades from going to bury him on the spot. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the body of Tbe or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the same rock on whom Tbey had laid the body. For some time, his mind was stunned iniri eonjeetures, but he finally returnedod, conjunçé that they had buricd the body for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrifying, arid misfortunes in which all apparently conspired to increase this melancholy superstitlous who had grasped his mind, who solved to leave him, we soon arrived at Smyma. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto, or to Naples, is busy organizing the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthvcn. Among other things, there was a case containing several criminal weapons, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were daggers and athletics. While turning them back, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise to find a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut – to be shuddered – hastening from gairi more proof, he found the gun, and his prostitute can be engraved when he discovered that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his heel. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they saw looking to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to make malolieve; but the particular shape, the same shade variable on the shaft and the sheath were similar in splendor on the tooth, and left no room for doubt; here were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, arid on his way back, in Rome, his first investigations corrected the lady whom he had tried to catch from Lord. Probably feminizing circles. His parents were in disgrace, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his secretary. Aubreys spirit became almost broken under many cable horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and bounded; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, if he were to save the life of someone he held dearly. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon set him on the shores of the Engl isb; and ho hastened at the house of his fathers, and there, for an inoment, appeared to love, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If such before, by her irifantious caresses, she had gained her grip, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that the gajnsthe gazes and the appearance of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the cured atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a charm memory about that that didn't seem to get up from misfo-\nbut of a certain sentiment inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a more brilliant kingdom. Its step does not have this light soot, which slrayf where a butterfly or a color can attract was selected and pensive. When alone, her face was never brigled by with a smile of joy; but where her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence, those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile for voluntary? It seemed that those eyes ,—that saco were then playing in the light of the proper riative sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. He had been thought by his guardians more fit than his prestigation should be delayed the return of a brother without a liler from the continent, when he could be his practicator. It was now decided that the next show, which is approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"by usey scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the house of his fathers, and fed on the melancholy that carried the bill. He could not appease interest in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfarl to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the city, and prepared for it the next day, which had been irritated as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a bad living room was not held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the flood of kingship hurried there. Bob Rey was there with his sister. While he was standing in a rut by his sons, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the remorse that the first time he had seen Lord Rutbven was in that same place, he suddenly felt grasped by his arm, and a voice that he caught up with tao, found in his ear —\"Remove your oath .\" He had an arduous courage to turn, rescued from seeing a thal spectrum, he would explode it, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure who had stirred his opinion or this place at the top of his first entry into the into society. He spoiled his limbs almost by refusing to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven home. He rushed into the room with tears pressed, and he threw hares on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would pass away from the brain. Lord Ruthuen again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — the ascent unleashed again! e :— He thought that his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, letforc, to return to society alone; for although he tried to ask Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in the information calling. He cried a few nights later with his sister for a long family in a close relationship. Leaving him under the protection of a matron, he rotated into a tree, and he gave himself his own devouting thoughts. Perceiving, finally, whom many left, he woke up, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in serious canversaliori; he tried to pass and approach her, who one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these characteristics to be the most horror. And he went forth, and took hold of the arm of his sister, arid, with a hurry, and forced her toward the street: and at the door of Tobe he snuck in the sons of the servants who were inflamed by their lords; and, if he were bound to pass over them, he heard again that the rogue murmured near him :\"Remember your oath !\"He dared not turn, but pressed his sister, soon reborn at his home.\nThe Aubrey became very distracted. If, before, his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certitude of the monster living has once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now meaningless, and it was in vain that she insulted her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He did only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more unbeliever he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he did, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could have been stained by him. But never, if he broke his oath, and revealed his suspects, who would lock him up? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death here had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when Hififter came, who, with his eyes flowing, begged Hiin, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, rinking longer able to breathe calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday smile as to the night damps. He was not a danger to be recognized; he returned first with the house of the evening; but at last he put it to rest where the fatigue exceeded him. This sister, concerned far from his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were removed by the hive that fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left by his all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to engage again in society, and wotch bim closely, anxious to hurt, despite his oath, all those who Lord Ruthven approached privacy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was ultimately obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the pirated monstrosity, the guardians considered appropriate to interpose, arid, fearing that the mind would alienate themselves, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had been imposed before them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to sow the hive of wounds and suffering, who had met daily in his wariderings, and prevent hiding from exposing to the general eye these what mclrks they considered madness, they directed a physician to reside in the house, and take care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, so that the mind was completely absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency became so great in the class that he was confined to his room. That was where there was a few days ago, unhappily waking up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had kept a glazed chandelier ;— the anesthetic sign of affection and respiration remained disp-\nHe sat down on his sister's entrance; then he started sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with the eyes that were grievous to him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't touch HLM — the love of the real love is great, riots approach him !\" When, however, she enquires to whom he has received, her only answer was :\"Truly !\" And again, he sarik in a state, from which he could not even shake. This lasted a lot of months: gradually, however, bone the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his glooin, while his guardians observed that the episcs on the hc cold day on his fingers a defined number, and then fmile.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, begged a corific with his physian on melancholic table circumstanco to be Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to his marriage. Harry's attention was immediately drawn; he asked almost whom. Happy with his inark return from the intellect, whom they feared to be deprived of, they mentioned the magic of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that he had met in society, Aubrey seemed to plead, and astonished them even more by saying his intention of both present to the nuptials, and wanting to soo his self-\nCr. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes the hlessister was with him. He was apparently again able to be afflicted by the influence of his beautiful flow; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once again olive so that he could feel the effect. He began to speak with all his wond warth, and to congratulate his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and all the achievements; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise at watching the traits of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and put it under the fool. ct: On her asking Bim why to be so destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing her hands ber, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of face, he told her sweater that she would never marry cem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem rem\nthinking Lord Ruthven was close to him, but didn't see anyone. In the meantime, the guards and the doctor, who had kept the whale, and thought it was only cl up from her disorder, entered, and Miss Aubreys frocing, wanted to leave a bim. He got on his knees, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the irisanity they imagined, had a large position of his mind, were striving to pacify and withdraw.\nLord Ruthuen had called the after morning the living room, and refused beer with all the others. When he had the beard of Aubreys ill health, he understood himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he considered well crazy, his exultation and pleasure could not be concealed from these ainongs that he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his companion to sow, and, six years of alternance, and the pretension of the affectionate great sister, brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His tongue had donners and loons to tell — could speak of himself as an individual of ari having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with his taste which he spoke to himself ;— could say how, Sirice whom he knew, his existence had begun to seem wicked of presruation. If it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in firic, he knew so well how to utter the root of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, tal gained affections beer. The title of the elder branch which was long-failing, was obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage to the TB ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brothel ,) which was held the same day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrecy, when left by the doctor of Tbe and his grandma, tried to bring the servos, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; they gave him a bill; he wrote a letter to his sister, wounding her, as she appreciated her happiness, her honor and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once put her in their arms as the hope and hope of their holiday, to delay this marriage for a few hours, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, which thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubreys mind any more by, what he considered, the bone raves a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can more easily be conceived as described, notes of occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the sound of the wagons broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of these servants at the point overcame their vigilance, he gradually stopped, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. How seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, arid at a moment ring himself in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, hurled him out of the room, furious without blemish. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear on the slaircosis ,\" Remember your oath, and know, if my wife is ever married, your sister is dishonored. The women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, under the influence of the old woman, had a carne in his dryer. Aubrey could no longer support his sons; his rage found no ventilating, had broken a blood vessel, and he was erupted in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the doctor was afraid to shake him. The wedding was solemnized, and the bride left London.\nEvery weakness increases; bloodshed produces TB symptoms near the approach to death. He wanted the guards of his sister to be called, waved when midnight had struck, he relativizes in the composite what the reader persisted — to have died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disapproved, and Aubreys sister had slipped to trust from VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Grcoins archipelago, aboard one of his Majesty's castles, in the year 1812, we went to the port of Mitylene, in the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supply of always food and vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both men of war and merchants; and although he is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his bountiosamply repay for the deviation of a voyage. We disembarked; like usual, at the bottom of the bay, and wbilst the meri were used to water, and the shaker negotiated for cattle with the natives, the clergy and myself taken a ramble at the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we mix with and engage a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he came badly from Scio with an Englishlord, who left the island four days before we arrived 1 in his feluoca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" he said ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave you Mitylene, where I am likely to freeze rnarried. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechjnes for lt ,( about Lz 50 English currency ), and resided there around aigrec months, but not constantly; for he sails lri his feluccauery often to the various islands .\"\nThis story excited our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time drinking at home where our peasant had resided. We were pleased to receive an alarm, which was directed against the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an enlarging room, a living room, a living room, a bedroom, an enclosed space closet. They were all decorated sumptuously: grace walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, set in motion a small fountain brieath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed spring on the side of a small Venus bronze in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. The Irish lobby stood on a dozen English cane chairs, and a book-ca empty: there were no mirrors or paints. The litter had only one large mattress lying on the float, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a low pil, the common bed throughout Greece. In the reclamation room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not think ourselves juslified in the exomining table contained. On the painting of the recreation of Alice Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and Rousseau, the works are finished; Valney Ruins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstock Messioh; Kotzebves novels; Schillers play of the Robbers; Milton Lost Paradise, an Ita-\nItalian edition, printed in Parma in 1980; some small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of the books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian and Latin. Mossia was coastally soribbled garlic more, and marked with sheets of paper, ori which were also remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The first one had read these books in the evening before being locked up, and forgot to put them with the others; but,\" he welded ,\" there they transferred me to his return; for it is so peculiar that I have been to move something with arders. He would borrow me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a sorcerer; and I did the work of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, the ox twenty zechins which I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adriaticopia; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extremely pleasant. The portico forward was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and porcelain work frets ,( as it is a riow customary in Greek architecture ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, flooded by a light stone balustrado, was covered by a thin turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evenings smoking iri, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and irritating the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the house, a small stream runs away, a group...\nhe, oranges and lindens gathered on his borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with the back of arnamental wood walls placed, on which we were told, the lord passed many of his furnaces and neighbors up to twelve clocks, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed that he might be very polite, and that he would always bind our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards looked at Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries, iri bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in a majestic today. A small stream from the ruins of which descended into broken casades, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, through a uista of high palm trees of coconut clouds, small several islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a view more than I did; but our requests were unanswered as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: Norie knew his name, but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Arrenian,\" said our canon,\" he said ,\"but I am sure he will not do it,\" he said ,\" and can you say it, my old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I do it ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our tour to the city we learned several details of the isolatodic lord. He shared Elgbite girls that he was the last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cowman, horses to others, arid silk of cotton to the girls who live by weaving these articles. Ho also bought a new boot away a fisherman who had lost his own in a scab, and he often gave Greek students to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we have collected, to have been a very eccentric character and benevolent. A waxumstanco that we are bequeathing, which our old friend Australia considered appropriate not to dissociate. He had a very valiant daughter, with whom the Lord was after seeing walking on the sea-part, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of this one.\nThis is the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this cleaner in Greece would be. He had money he was used: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular goods. When we arrived in Palermo, all our customs were disappointed. Falling company with Mr. FOSTER, the archbitec, a student of WYATTLES, who had been traveling to Egypt and Greece ,\"The indlivill,\" he said ,\"on whom in you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met hiin in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I also vis-à-vis-\n\" I told Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the name of his lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. Deeply did we regret not having been more curious in our rescarches at the cottage, but we have consoled ourselves with the idea of relurning in Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, by helping him not quite uncomfortable, and in court in the good name of his lord, which was grossly slandered. He was described as an insensitive dispassion, contrary to the assailation of human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or to add his pleasures. The fact is directly the rovers, as the only clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the keener feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in his seniory poems, seem to have their place in his bosom. Tendernoss, sympathy and charity seem to guide all the actions of bis; and his courteousness of solitude rest is an additional reason to mark him as a being on which the heart religion has put the beer seal, and on whose head Benevolence Halh has cast hermantle. No man can read the pleasant \"traits\" precedent without feeling proud of him as an emissary. By respecting his love and pleasures, I do not assume the right to give my opinion. Relationships must always be greeted with caution, with portiosity, when they affect the skin integrity of a man; and the one who dares to justify himself, that is to say, the horrific trial in which all must cling, only can censor the wanderings of a dead-living person. LordByron character is crazy about his genius. Doing madness in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Courl, Fleet Street.",
    "31": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polldorl.\nThe superftition on which his tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, he seems to be a combination: however, he did not explain himself to the Greeks until they afflicted the establishment of Christianity; and he took his form presounded only from the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it buried their terroire, he gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still excavated, of dead tbe raising from their tombs, and feeding on the hlood of young and beautiful tbe. In the West, it spread, with the same slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, that belief existed, that the nightly numbers soaked up some of the burden of their victims, who were moved, lost their strength, quickly perished from consumption; while these fattened human blood suckers—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, to the point of causing blood to escape from their pasfages, even pores from their skin.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is an eurious and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which Js declared to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the chief magnard and the magistrates of the square, they were positive and unanimously affirmed that, about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassouia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been torried by clumber, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampire, and rubbing himself with blood of his. This precaution, however, prevented him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after death and burial of his, many people com-\nhe was tormented by him, and a statement was ransacked, beating four people had been deprived of reading his article. To avoid other malice, the inhclbitants having consulted their Hadagni, took over the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and enlirely free of corruplion, and emit to the movement, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to a usual remedy. A pole was completely driven through an Amold cell heart and body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. This did, they cut his head off, burned his body, and threw the ashes into the grave. The samc measures were adopted with the corses of those persorif who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in their turn, become begles on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre herself, and sucks in turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrouf rodomontade also where relativizes, asks it better suited to illustrate the subject of current observers than any other instance that could be added d. In many parts of Greece, it is entrusted as a kind of punishment after death, for the home of a heinous crime committed while in extortion, that the deceased is not only made for vampyris, but forced to limit his internal visits only to those who loved him most on earth, to whom who was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A support alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBvt first on the earth, as Vampyre fent, thy horn shall be torn from its sepulchre; then haunt the native dish, and suck the blood of all thy wreath; there of thy daughter, sister, wife, At midnight of a stream of life; yet forget the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, are eyet exhaled, Shall knoweth the devil for their sire; As you curse, you curse larn, your ore flowers with...\nHe is on the stern. But he who, for your crime, is to be kindled, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father: This word shall engulf your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his oheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who looks like his life without spot; then, with his hand without spot, will tear the braids of his hair, including, at first, a lock when the affection of the tenderest commitment has been warned — But now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! Yet with the best blood of the thiary down must flow; your nibble tooth, and your slug; then rushing to your sullcn grave, Go-clend with the rave Gouls and Afrils, Tjll thesein bror brink far from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also presented in the wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the Corsican vampyre of the good Arabic Oneiza, which is represented cls having returned from the grave for the purpose. It is the tormenter that is best washed when there is once. But this cannol is supposed to have led the sinvousness of the life of beer, which being poured through the soul, the quire of the tale as a complete type of purity arid innocence. The veracio nous Tournefort has long reported on his journeys of several aslonising cases of vampyrism, which he claims to have been a witness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides the waariety of the arieodotes, and traditional illustrative narratives of his effort.\nthis, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as a barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting information about this singularly horrific suporstition might be added; although the present can resist the limits of a riot, unjustly devoted to explanatiori, and which may not be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use of mado in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIn the midst of the accompanying dissipations, there was a London winter, similar to the small parts of this lead of the town, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted the attention of the bis, that which could by a glance calm him, and throw fear into these bread.\nms where the thoughts reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain when it was disappearing: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, standing on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce inside working over the beard; but fell on the spoon with a radius of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to the evory house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the misfortune of envy, were pleased to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In the epile of the mortal tint of her face, which took on a warmer tint, either in the buffoon of the rnodity, or in the strong emolion of passion, although its shape and the beautiful werrc contours, much of the femalc hunter after having tried to make known to her attention, and gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been inockery of all the shewn iri monsters from the drawing rooms since her death, threw himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew himself in his way, and made all the purpose put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, drew her opinion :— although jn vain :— when she stood before him, again he stood as if they were experienced ;— even hor impudence inappalled was affled, and sbe left the field. Bul, although corn adultery could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it is not that the female sex was indifferent to hiin: but soon was the apparent warning that he spoke to the vrucious wife and innocent daughter, that few knew to be addressed to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they mocked at his apparent hatred of love, he was like countless among those feminists who make up the boast of their sex of domestic virtues toil, as shouting at those who jostling by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a gentleman of Aubrey's dream arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left in possession of a great wealth, by parerits that died while he was still in childhood. Left to him, too, by the Canadians, who simply represented their duty to look after the fortune, while they abandoned the most burdensome burden of his mind to the care of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated more bisinagination than his judgment. So he had this high novel....\nThis feeling of honor and frankness, which will ruin so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown in by Provideanoe simply for the pictorial effect of the scene, as we see in the novels: he thought that the misery of a character was merely constituted by the clothes vesling bones, which were also warm, but which were adapted to the eye of the painter with their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, devious and rich: these reasons, at the time of his entry into gay circles, many mothers subjugated him, trying to describe with the least truth, their languishing or scrambling favorites: the girls at the same time, by the faces rbrighting when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely balls, he was surprised to find, shot, except in the tallow on wax candles that freaked out, not from the presence of a ghost, but of the scent of snugging, there was no basis in real life for any of these congerios of plaids, images and defriptions contained in these values, from which he misformed his studies. On the other hand, by seeing his gratified vanity, some compensation Iri refrain from abandoning the dreams of this, when the extraordinary being we described above, orders him in his career.\nHe struck him; and the impossibility very to renounce an idea of the character of an inan entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, that the agreement tact to their existence, iplified by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon forned this object in the hero of a romance, and determined to obsess the progeny of biscancy, rather tuna the person in front of him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, attached so far in his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. He gradually embarrassed Lord Rutbvon back, and soon found that the preparation notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining some information about this character of a singer, wbo, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian. It was time for him to perform the hur, which for many generations has been necessary to allow the young love to take a few quick sleeps in the caroer or vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them the paper as if fallen fresh skys, when scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasant or os praise, according to the description of the skill that there is to carry them. They considered: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the waters of Eiroliring.\nHilbert, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Arthur. Now he found that, although most of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions of the apparent motive to his conduct. His currency was abundant in his liberality ;— the lazy, the vogabond, and the beggar, received from his hand that ought to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could avoid the dream.\nrking, that he was not on the virtuoso, reduced to indulgence by the accompanying misfortunes even on virluus, that he granted his olms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask something, nol to relieve his wonts, bul to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. However, this has been attributed by harm to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the chassary of his Lordship, which was fatill more impressed on his mind: all those upon whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion began to seize the centros of all fashjonable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always gathered success, excepl where the known antagonist wos bis, and then he lost even inore than he won; but he always began to take hold of the same nacelle of imbangirig, with the whicb which he generally looked around society: it was not, however, when he caught the eruption of a young voice, or the father without luck of a Numrovs family; then his wish seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit was removed, and his eyes were astonished with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, for fear that he had previously asfluent youth, torn from the oar, cursed, in the madness of a dungeon, the thal spell had attracted him to the reach of this proud; while mary a father sat fraritic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without a single farlhing of his last immense wealth, when with even your buy enough to satisfy their present desire. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of Mary, the last dorlot that he had just ripped off the convulsive catch of the innocent: this might but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, However, able to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him for a relief that charity and pleasure which turned out to be the ruin of all, and did not take it for his own benefit ;— but how retarded — for it is to be hoped that his friend would give him a little opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, bc did not get greater grolification of it than the constant oxoitization which vainly wanted to break this mystery, whatb to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatural itself.\nThey soon went to Rome, and Aubrey for a last glance from his companion; he left him every day in the presence of the morning circle of an Italian country, as he went to search for memorials in an almost deserted city. When he was so engaged, letters madroyed englarid, whom he opened with impatience; the first was frain bis sister, breathing without holding but affection; the others were fram his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his cornion, they seemed to give him a valid reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediately leaving his money, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, more than the possession of irresistible power of seduction, making bis incentious bacits more dangerous to society. It had been dlsco vered, that his econtempt for adultery had not originated in chemistry from his character; but that he demanded, in order to strengthen bis gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be precipitated from the pinnacle of the unsuspected virus kills, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: iri fine, that all the semals which he had sought, apparently on the accustomance of their virtue, had, since his departure, even threw the mask, and bad do not scruple themselves to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey broke away by leaving one, who had a character who had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abjure him completely, in order, in the medical during, to monitor him more closely, and not to let the light circulantarices by non-noticod. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that bis Lordship was convinced to work until the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of which house is a cheerful front. In Italy, it is rare for a married woman to be met in society; he was there before he pursued his plans in the surret; but Aubrey eye followed them. In all his tricks, and soori discovered that an assignment had been named beer, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent, though an infallible girl. Without wasting any time, he entered Lord Ruthuen's apartment, and abruptly asked him for his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet his very close throat. Lord Ruthven replied: tell his internions were pursued as he thought Oll would live on such an occasion; and poor being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, simply laugh. Aubrey retired; immediately, he noted to Fay, that he had to refuse to accompany his lordship in the commander of their proposed tour, he ordered his servant to search for others apart, and called the mother of Iady, accompanied him with all that he knew, not as regards the ber daughter, but as regards the character of his lordship. The assignment has been proven. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to notify his consent complete to a separation; but did not suggest any suspicion of his hodging plans were followed by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the peninsula, the foon found himself in Athons. He then fixed his rosidenc in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of traoing the records faded from monuments, giory upon anoients who, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of the Freomens only in front of the slaves, had hidden themselves flouted the floor protruding or many colorlichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a heligium, so beautiful and so delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter wishing loforlray a canvas, the pramized hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke to 0 a lot of spirits for only to think she could belong to those who had no Sauls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought the look island a type poor of her beauties; for who would have exhausted her eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, sor that the sleecy luxurious look of animal tbe flees but to the taste of an epic. The light ftep of Iclntbe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the dishonest girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmerc, would show the beauty that is of her shape, floating as she was on the wind, to euger the look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just decrypted upon a tablet almost from the front, in contemplation of her figure of sylph. Osten would like her braids to fall, to flirt around, to expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, to excite the oblivion of the antiquarian, which leaves the very object he had before the end of his mind. of the vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why linger at shades that all feel, but none can cling ?— It was innocent, young, and heavy, without being affected by the arid drawing salons, striking balls. While he was drawing rems of which he wanted to keep a mernorical for his future hours, she stood hy, arid looking at the magical effects of her perietal, in traoing the scenes of her place native; she would then describe him the danoe circling on the open plain, painted him, in all the brilliant colors of the youth memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, told him all the adrenalal tales of her nurse. His seriousness and his appearance of what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the tale of the first uippyre, who had passed yess in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a pretty femalo to prolong his existence for the months that followed, his blood ran, while he tried to laugh at it by so many idle and horrible faritasies; but Ianthe quoted him to explain his heart, and when she sounded so irritated, that he begged him to appease him, not to have any truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excile a bell tower in Lord Ruthvens supernctural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to ancient; his innocence, so contrasted by the uirlucs affected by the men among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, gained hive heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still to find himself more and more attached to the almost magical form of himself. He was tearing himself to Timcs from her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he was leaving, determined riot to return until 1. his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to find his attention to the ruins around him, which in bis and he killed an image that seemed to be the sole possessor rightful of his acronyms. The native was unconscious of his love, and had the same frank child that he known the child first. She always seemed to separate herself from the reluctance of him with; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favor haunts, while the guard bear was busy sketching or displacing a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, claimed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of the bus excursions, which had to keep him sora for a few hours; he who heard the name of the place, they immediately begged him for the riot to return to the neighborhood, as it is necessary to pass through a wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the station of the vampires in their night orgies, and set the otherwise evils as imperative on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to I would take them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so as to mock a superior, infamous power, the very name of which apparently rendered blood through free ze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey salted upon his unattended excursion; he was surprised to obscure the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, intimidating the belief of a horrible friend, had irritated larn with such terror. When it came to talking, Ianthe came beside his horse, and began seriously to bring him back, the night crew allowed him to put into action the power of the thing beings ;— he promised. However, he was so ocupated in his research, that he did not understand that the light of the day was going to ignite, and that in theory there were a lot of spots which, in the warmer calms, rapidly gather in a tremble mass, and pour all their circle on the devoted land .— He finally, a rainbow, mounted his horse, deleminated lo moke by the speed at his delay: but he was too late. Twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and he had odvariated far away, the storm's power was above — his thunders failing had barely a resting interval — his heavy thick rairi forced his way through the cranberry foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his very feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the forest of England. The animal, at last tired, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a hospital which hardly rose from the masses of dead hounds and a brush that surrounded it. Dismounting, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust in the shelter of the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a miringing woman with the suffocation of mockery, out of a cough, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the cabin. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided the hive. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the findings continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He came into contact with the former one, which he seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Always baffled !\" and he felt harassed by the one whose strength seemed superhuman: he distangled himself to sell his life as hard as he was, he was fighting; but he was in a valley: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself, kneeling on his chest, had bent his hands on his throat—where the glare of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, the trouble ;— rose up instantly, clinged, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at a time the crushing of the branches of that, as he broke the wood, was more heard ria. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded with a big soot glitter on each foot. In search of Aubrey lhey who had attracted him to his screams, he was again left in the darkness, but it was his horror, when torches light again burst on him, to perceive the aerial form of his coriductor liver brought in a corse without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision that came up disturbed imagination; but either agairi saw the healthy form, when he unlocked them, scattered by his side. There was no heart on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that clinged to the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth that opened the vein :— to these men pointed, weeping, struck simultaneously with borror ,\" At Varnpyre! A vampire !\" A litter was formed, and Aubrey was said next to her who had already been to him the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life who had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were: the spirit was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflector, the world took refuge in the vacancy; he had almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular corporation, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly welcomed by different parties who had been recruited into the searohof that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, if they approached the city, prepared the parents for a terrible catastrophe. \"For despair, their sorrow would be impossible; but when they had dried up the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable; both died in the heart of the brokon.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with the most violent fever, and was often delirious; on occasion he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe — by an unusable combination, it seemed in turn to his fragrant companion to spare the beloved being. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Athens, and, on whatever grounds, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and bewitched his attondanlston. When he withdrew from his delirium, he horrified and stunned the sight of him whose image he had combined with the thal of a dragon; but the Lord Rulh-\nBy his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separatism, and even more by the atteriti, the anxiety, and the care that he showed, soon reconciled his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; only the apothetic body that had so surprised Auhrey, but as soon as his began convalescence to be quick, he again graduated-\nAlly pulled back in the same state of mind, Clrid Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engulfed by looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or iri marking the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyefowl of all.\nThe spirit of Avbrey, by this shock, was much curved, arid this elasticity of the mind that held once if it rained it would seem to run away forever. He was now as fond of silence and silence as Lord Ruthven; but although he was still solitude, the spirit did not find him in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he had previously frequented, his shape stood by his side – if he looked for him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned around, showing, to the wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a sweet smile upon his lips. He has determined to make beautiful scenes, all of which have created bitter associations in his mind. He introduced Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken of him during his illness, whom they shook alive these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They traveled in all directions, and they sought every place to whip a resolerance that they had clinged to; but they had clinged from one place to another, but they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard thugs, but they gradually began to lighten the relationship, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generosity of those which they defended against the pretoned dangers. As a result, by neglecting the counsel of the inbebitants, they occasionally traveled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. Incoming upon, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with great masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they had the reason to repent of their neglect; for there were only a few of the portals engaged in the pass of Nclrow, when they were starred by the bull.\nleaves near their heads, and by echoing the report of several rifles. In a...\nThe guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, they started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their examination, withdrew for a moment behind the shelling of the defilement: but shameful to be so detained by a fire, who, with insulting cries, hurt them, arid being exposed to unroslating slaughter, if one of the thieves should cl imb above and take them into the rcar, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost the shelter of the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which led him to the ground. Avbrey hastened to seek help; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised by the fact that the robbers gave him his face — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately tossed his arms off.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon instructed them to convey his friend wounded to a cahin neighbor; and having accepted a ransom, he was not indiscreet by their presence — they were content to keep the entrance until their comrade retum with the sum prarnized, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly diminished; in two days, bitter mortification, and death proceeded with precipitated steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of objects about him: bul towards the olose of the last evening, his mind seems unhealthy, and the bis eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering bis assistance with more than usual solicitude —\"Assist me! You save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my life, I listened to the death of my existence, just like the death of the day of the past; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? Tell me how? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little of my life flourishes, I can do everything. If you want to concoal everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and I was known for some time in England, I — but read. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising up with exulting violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to the living being in all calamity, whatever happens, or whatever you may see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their base :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was laughing on his pillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but he did not sleep; many circonstones attended his knowledge with this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a fall came to him, as if there came from the presentation something horrible awaiting him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the hole into what he had left the body, when a thief met him, arid informed him that it was not longer there, having been involved by himself and camerades, at the time of retirement, at the pina-\nAccording to a promise, they had made his secretary, he had to be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and bury him in the place he sowed. But, when he had mounted to the top be found no trace of the body or the elothes, although the rohbers swore that they reported the identical rock on which they laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but which finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he encountered such terrible misfortunes badly, and in which also appearedryly conspired to increase that superslitious melancholy who had seized on his urid, he decided to leave him, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to pass it on to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects of the glasses which he had had belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, it was a case involving several criminal weapons, the purpose of which was to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. If he turned them around and examined their wound forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style as the daggor discovered in the hot family — he trembled — rushing to obtain other evidence, he found his weapon, and his horror can be imagined that he discovered that it was equivalent, although particularly shaped, to the sheath he held in the bis hand. His eyes seemed no more secure: faith seemed to be linked to the dagger; however, he wanted to get rid of joy; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the shaft and the sheath were both splendorful, and left had no place for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrno, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had sought to extract from the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. His parents were in the distros, their forlone ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of his secretary. Abrcy's spirit became alinose broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had a victim at the anthem to destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only profession was to exhort the postilions of speed, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way on the English shores; and he hastened to the inspiration of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infattine caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to approach, she was even more boring as a companion.\nMiss Aubroy did not have this winning grace that gave the game and applause from the salon assemblies. There were no bones than the brilliant light that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the bone of the mind. There was an absolute meancholycharm that did not seem to emerge from the fortune, but frowns some enemy inside, which seemed to induce a consecuous soul of a brighter kingdom. Its step is not so liberating, that a butterfly or a color can attract it. That is, it was sedate and pensive. When one of them, his face was not illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection, and forgot in the presence those deed that she knew to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged the smile of that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face were then playing in the light of their own native speaker. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been subjected to war, because she had been more fit by her grandparents than her presentation had to be delayed upon her return from her brother of the continuing, what could she be her protector. So it was now solved without the next salon, which was approaching, should be the time of its entry into the blue \"busy scene\". Rather, Aubrey would remain in the house of his magnifiers, fed on the melancholy that dominated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort for the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the town, and prepared the next day for them, which had been announced as a show.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to grin in the smile of the kingship, hadtened to do so. Everybody was there with his sister. As he swung into a corner by himself, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered into the remorse that, the first time he had seen Lard Ruthven was in that truthful place, he suddenly felt seized by his arm, in a voice which he well recognized, sounded in his ear :\"Rend your oath .\" He had barely coordinated your turn, tiring to see a total spectrum would explode it, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his opinion a high spot when he first entered society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friar, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were asraid, his tang that was inflamed with a big brain. Lord Rut even again accuses him — circumstances started in the dreadful picture — the dagger — his oath. — He blushed back, he covered the riot believe it is possible — death rises again !— Ho thought his imagination had conjured up the mental hjs image was upsetting. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore declerates, to go again in society; for although he tried to ask for the concerned Lord Ruthven, the narne hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a near relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to recreation, and Tobero gave himself up to his own devoring thoughts. Perciving, last city, which many were leaving, he woke up himself, and centering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to inove, turn around, and revealed to him the features of those he had the most heinous. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with the hurried step, forced her to the street; at the door he himself snuck up by the crowd of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard this voice whispering near him :\"Remember the oalh !\" He dared to turn, but, pressed his sister, saon came to the house.\nAubrey became the most distracted. If before this mlnd hcld been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now that the certainty of the living of the monster has again pressed on his thoughts. The sister's attentions were now irrelevant, and it was in clinical thal which ln treated her to explain to her what had caused by abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he walked, the more he was shocked. His oath came up, hjm ;—did he allow this monster to wander, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he had of gold, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. But even if he violates his oath, and reveals his suspicions, who would attract him? He thought of opulating his own hand to free the world of being a wretched; but death, he remedied, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in his condition; locked in his room, he could not see anything, and only when his sister came, who, with streoming eyes with tears, begged him, for her, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear sylnoses and loneliness, he leaves his house, street street roamod, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress was spoiled, and he wandered, as an oyster exposed to the midday sun as well as to the midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned with him at night at home; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by fatigue. His sieve, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they quickly defamed themselves by him who fled from a pressure faster than any other, far from you. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that by his presence, he left all his friends, with a sudden amorigist, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again in society, and to look closely, anxious to foresee, despite his oath, all those who in Lord Ruthven learned spiritual irimatity. But when he entered the hall of the club, his gazes of baggard and suspicion were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to let go to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the reappearance collapsed, the guardians thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would ease, they thought it was very strong to recall the trust that had been imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had daily suffered from his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of the whale which they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and to take care of him permanently. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incohorence finally became so great, that he was confined to the blue chamber. There, he often lied for days, unable to boast. His eyes were bad with a glassylustre ;— the only sign of arid affection himself remembered his sister's entrance; then he sometimes began, and, to grasp his hands, with Io looks that gravely distressed, he wanted her not to touch HLM. \"Oh, don't come near him, if you need me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he mentioned, but the only answer was ,\"True! True !\" and again, which sank into a state, from which even she did not call him to wake him up. Tbls lasted many months: gradually, comments, as the year passed, his acquaintances became frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guards observed that sevora once in the day he counted up to on his fingers a defined number, and then smile.\nThe rioarly had passed, when, on the last day of the year, once of his guardians inheriting from his room, began to converse with his doctor on the melancholy circumstance of the being of Aubrey in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Immediately, Aubrey drew his intention; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whose they feared that which had been declined, they brought the name of the Count of Mar sden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed ploughed, and astonished them even more by his exhibition of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his lovatory smile; for he pressed his chest to, and kissed his cheek, wet of tears, of flow-\nTo the idea that his brother is more alive to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congregate the hcr upon ber marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accom fold; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his panties; opening it, which was his overpriced to see the characteristics of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he thus despised the resumption of her future husband, he seemed to understand it, then to grasp the hands of beer, to look at it with a frenetic expression, to swear that she never married this inonster, for he — but he could have rioted advanted — it seemed that if this thing became again remembered his oath — he turned abruptly around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. The guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing and thought it was only a cold return to her disorder, entered, forcing Miss Aubroy to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged the trick to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to the madness, they imagined having taken hold of his spirit, enslaved to pacify him and to withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had called the mother after the living room, and had been truffled with too many others. When he heard of Aubroy's health, he willingly seized him for his cause; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleas could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretenuated of a great offense for the brother and interest in this destiny, graduated by the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His language has dangers and tools to tell—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the earth of crowds, except with the one to whom he addressed ;—could say how, sin what he knew, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, was it simply that he could enumerate with his soothing accents ;— finally, he knew it so. how to use the art of a servant, or this was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. As the title of the older branch fell to it in length, he obtained an important character, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brothel ), which was to take place on the very day of his departure from the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but just failed. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sieve, conjuring her, she attaches value to her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grove, who held her in their arms as their hope and hope of the house to delay but sor call a few hours of marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sorcerers promised that they would deliver it; bvt give it to the doctor, he tangbt itbetter to no longer harass Miss Aubreys mind by, what he considered, the grudges of a maniac. The night passed without the rest of the occupied prisoners of the bouso; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be easier than described, the notes of occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the wagons broke on his ear. Aubrey grows almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally surpassed their vigilance, they gradually looted, lurking in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized Ibe opportunity, if a relationship was out of the room table, and at a moment was in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the bill: he approached himself immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice with fury. When on the battlefield, Lord Ruthvenwhlspered in his ear —\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my sling in the day, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, surprised by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubroy could lean on himself; his fury, which had no wind, had broken a blood vessel, and it was transmitted to the body. This note was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride, married, left London.\nAubrey irregular weakness. ; bloodshed produced symptoms of the near-death approach. We could call his sister's grandparents, and when the hour of the night hit badly, he wrote what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guardianshastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but who they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"Tho the world was in front of him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Majefty's bladders, in 1812, we put into the prefect of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain suspense of cattle and vegots still have had there, leading many Britishesses to visit it — both men of war and mercha-\nntmen; and although just is caught off the track for ships linked to Smyrne, his premiums amply reimburse for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water, and the handbag bandaged for cattlc with the natives, the clergy arid me at or rambled to the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had already looked. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met the spirit and engaged a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had the same Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his festival. \"He hired me like a pawn,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I didn't have the choice to leave Mitylene, what am I likely to marry? He was a DJ, but a very good man. The contract above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechines, sor it ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided there about eighty months, although he is not tough; so he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account greatly excited our chill, and we did not waste time rushing into the house where our countryman had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the floor-floor—an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting parlover, and a hedroom, with a spacious closet and annexed. They were all simply decorated: simple walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed iri springing on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and a library of poetry: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one mattress of barley lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets, stuffed and one pillow – the 6 common throughout Greece. In the rest room, we observed a baseball recreation. Once, the old man told us, wired with books and papers, who were then in the chest of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves by examining the contents. On the Tablet of Recreation are the works of Voltajre, Sbakspeare, Bojleau and Rousseou, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerman, in German, the Messiah of Klopstock, the novels of Kotzebue, the room of the Robbers of Sohilor, the Paradise of Milton, an Italian building printed in Parma in 1810, several small pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, very torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books wore marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with slides the paper off, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they waited there until his return; for it is so special that if I moved something without orders, he would throw me on for a week together; he is always very good. I have done him a favor once; and I have the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of him, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Armenian who wanders in the house of srall in the wood of Tbe, and that the lord brought here brake Adrianople; I do not know for which reason .\"\nThe external table because the appearance was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen broad, and the marblc pillars canned with black plinths and corriches sret-work ,( cls it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful carpet of Turkey, beneath an awning of coarse linen strong. Most housetops are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left, we entered the house, a small stroclmlel glissa, grapes, oranges and lime were clotted together on its borders, and under the shade of two bushes of largecmyrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were read, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, for he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, these Sundays.\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be described as a \"bird view\". An of the rich riveryards line led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olives and bilberries, flowers of iri, and on the top of which an ancient Greek dull appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stretchlm escapes from the ruins that descend into broken waterfalls, until it is the last in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea is smooth as the glass, and a borizon not overshadowed by an eloud sour, tarnished the view in front; and a wing on the lholeft, through a vista of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, the small severcll islands were clearly obsessed, spreading the lghl blve wove with spols of emerald green. I felt enjoyed a view more than I did; but our demands bore fruit like the dream of the person who had rode in this romantic solitude: no one knows his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conduct ,\" Could he say, but I am sure he will not do it,\" and can you not say an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on the return over to the city we learned the several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the typhoon island, and even drank with them at the Riuptielle party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the glitters that live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a freshman who had lost his own in a storm, and he gave Greek treatment to poor children. In short, it seemed to have been a very eccentric and henivolent character from all that we have collected. A circumstance lurks us, which over old friends at the cottoge that prepares not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a pianoforte, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mjtylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who its rambling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricties that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"of whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his lordship, because we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put into our hands, we re-elected the reclus of Calcla on the eurey page. We have not regretted that we have not been more numerous in our research at the cottage, but we have joined the idea of returning to Mitylene the next day, but to me that day will never return. I make his statement, attesting him not entirely uninteresting, and in court to his senior name, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these small anedotes. All the finer feelings of heart, from elementary depicts in the poems of his secretary, so have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon which the Religion sealed his heart, and upon which the Bénévolence threw his coat. No cari man has read the previous pleasant \"trails\" without bragging about him as a countrymari. With respect for his love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. We must always receive rapports with a calion, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and he who dared to justify himself before the horrific trinal where everything must appear, only blame errors towards another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and avoiding applause from the world, is the testimony trick of a various audience and Conficiency self-approval.\nTHE END!\nGilet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "32": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is found is very general in the Orient. Among the Arabs, it seems to be a common: it does not, arch...\ncvor, extends to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its form presounded only from the division of the Latin and Greek churcbes; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body would not corrupt itself buried life in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still exist, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the broom of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with variations of mass, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the existing belief, that vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, loosed their strength and died quickly of consumption; while the human lhees 6 suckers grated — and their veins became distended to evacuate a state of corruption, in order to cause the blood of all the posages of their bodies, and always pores of their skin, to flow.\nIn the London Journal of Maroh ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, the credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It is, in fact, that by examining the chief comparator and the magistrates of the place, one had heard positively and not immediately confirmed, that, about five years later, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a varnpyre, but had had a way to get rid of the evil, eating some from the earth of the gravillon of the vampyre, and rubbing his sons with his blood. This precauti, rainbow, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid further misadventures, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in vampyism cases) fresh, and wholely free from corruption, and the etinction splints the muzzle, nose, and ears, the pure florid blood cold. Since Proaf was thus obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was entirely pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, at the time when he was recited for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. And they took his head off, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The few measures were adopted with the those orses of people who had provously died of vampyrism, lest they should, in their turn, the two other agents who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person sucked by avampyre becomes a volunteer himself, and sucks it its turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here, because it seems better suited to the subject of the present observation that any instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, far from some crime committed while in existence, the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrlse, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to the beings he loved most on earth — those to whom he was taken by the ties of kiridrcd and ffection. — A supposition allowed in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be praised from his tomb; and then haunted the place of origin, Aridsuok the blood of every race Ly; there of thy daughter, sisler, wife, At midnight drairi the stroclm of life; Yetloathe the banquet that performeth shall feed thy living oorse, thy victims, ero they exhale again; Shail knows that they demoried for their sire; In curse, thou cursed them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But the one who for your crime must fall, the youngest, better praised of all, Sball blesses you with the name of a sather — This word will wrap your heart in flame! And yet, the last glazed look must see What freezes over its blue lifeless; Then the hand without Halloween will tear The toses of his yellow air, of which, iri life a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn — But now is neo awoy hy the Memorial of thirtie agony! But with your best drop of blood, your grinning tooth, and your harry lip; then harassing to the svllen falls, Golarid with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror shrink from spectrum more cursed than they.\nMr. Sou-\nThey also introduced into his beautiful wild paem but from \"Thalaba\", the vampyrous course of the Arab Majd Incizcl, which is rethought as having resisted from the grave in order to torment him, she loved better what is in existence. But this cannot be assumed to have results from the sinflness of her life, she threw the whale of the tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his travels of cases of severe clstonishing of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his work of groat on this subject, besides a uariety of anecdotes, and the traditional narratives illustrious of its effects, put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions on this singularly horrible superstittion could be added; although the current means suffices for the limits of a note, nokssarily devoted to the explanation, and which can now be corincided by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there is several other synonymovs with it, makes use of en var-\nregions of the world: Vrouoolocha, Vardulaoha, Goul, Broucoloka, etc.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the dissjpatioris that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank, appeared to the different parties of the town leaders. He was making fun of him, as if he could participate here. Apparently, then Ighl laughs at the fair only attracted his attention, so that he can, by a glance, stifle him, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixing on the face of an object tube, did not seem to penetrate, and with one glance to pierce through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities used him to invite him to the house of greed; all wanted to see him, and these weapons had been used to violent excitement, and now we felt the weight of boredom, were placed to hack something in their hairy presence to engage their attention. In the aspile of the dead hue of her face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of modesty, or from the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and contours are beautiful, many female hunters, after notoriety, have tried to gain attention, and to win, at least, some marks from which they might be affectionate: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monfter worn in the drawing rooms since her marrage, has started, and put everything except on the robe of a Montane bank, to attract her attention :— but in vain :— when she passed before him, although the eyes of this were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed bone if they were not pierced ;— even her uncrowned impvender waf bafied, and she left the field. But even if the common outlet could not influence even the direction of his eye, there was not that the female sex was undifferentiated to him; however, he was particularly careful with whom he addressed the virtuous woman and the innocent girl, but few knew that he was speaking to domestics. However, he had the repudiation of a wrong tongue; and if it was the struggle she even averced the fear of her singular character, or that the lhoy was moved by her apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among those women who boasted of their sex of their doistic virtuosities, as among those who shoved her by their voices.\nAt about the same time, he arrived in London, a young gentleman of the name of Aubrey: he was an orphan left with a single sniff in the possession of great wear, by parents who died while he was still in existence. im: too....\nThe guards, who thought it was their duty to take care of his fortune, while abandoning the most important burden of his mind, the care of the subaltem mercenaries, caught up more in his emergence than in his judgment. He therefore had this sense of honour and love of Romanesque frankness, which, every day, destroys so many apprentices, millions. He believed everything to sympathize with the virtue, and thought that the thal vice was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a collage consisted simply in the vestiring of the clothes, which were as hot, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folding and various colored patches. How thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the straightness of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, on his entry into gay circles, many mothers subjugated him, trying to describe the least truth, the favourites their language or snoring: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon brought him to false notions of his talents and merit. He was attached to the romance of solitary hours of this, he was surprised to flirt, that, except in the tallow and wax almonds that freaked out, not in the presence of a ghost, but from lacks snuffing, there is no foundation in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant photos and dissoriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, by finding compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to reread his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above, went through the hive in his career.\nHe observed it, and it was very impossible to form an idea of the character of an entire man ashsorbed iri himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, that the lacit consent to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: to allow his imoginalion to paint all that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly forced this object into the hero of a romance, and discouraged to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the persori in front of him. He made himself known with him, drew attention to him, and so far has advanced to his opinion, which his whole presence has always recognized. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and the saon found, according to the notes of preparation in — Streot, that he was able to voyage. Desirous of gain a certain incultation about this singular child actor, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians, that there is time for him to tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to enable the young to take a little quick sleep in the pillow of the vice to put them on an equality with the old, and not to allow the in to appear as fallen of the skjes, scandalous wbonever intrigues are mentioned as the subjecls of pleasaritry or praise, according to the degree of skill that there was in the holding of these skjes. They argued: and Aubrey immediately begged his intentions, your Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from a bim a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a brand of system of him, who, apparently, had nothing in the cornmon with other men, who willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Auhrey bad had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found, hot, although many more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different color inclusions of the motifs appear to his conduct. His composition was profuse in his liberality ;— the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Auhrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the calamities that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he lowered his alarms ;- this was senl from the door with sneezes barely crushed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to fulfill his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich purity. However, it was attributed by him to the greater importance of the vicious, which generally prevails on the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more clear on the mind: all those whom he was granted the purpose, inevitably found that there was a cure on her, so that they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk down and blame the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrcy was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought centros of all the modelable vices; there he entered into all the true spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, unless the known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but he always made the same immutable face, with which he sweeped society around: it was not, however, when he encountered the eruption young novice, or father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed fortune; this apparent abstraction of the spirit was cast aside, and if the eyes shone the fire of death than that of the cat that deluded with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he is afraid that the old youth flocked, torn apart from the circle which he has adorned, elucidating, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him into the reason of this friend; while rnany a father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his late immensc wealth, where to buy enough sufficient for society their present envy. However, he did not take any scramble to the tablo garnling; immediately ivt, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he had just rolled off from the convulsive take of innocent TB: this could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which did not waf, However, capable of fighting the most experienced hearing. Avbrey often wanted to drop this to his friend, and begs him to resign this barbarity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not bring to his own profit ;— but to be delayed — for every day he hoped to give him a certain contribution to speak frankly and openly to him; comments, this never happened. Lord Rutbven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than the lips of hls; and although Aubrey was riare on the object of the curiosity of hls, he did not obtajnobtaj any more gratification of him than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of the coin; he let him attend every day the morning circle of an Italian woman, as he went in search of the memarials of another almost deserted city. To the extent that he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, having only affection; the others came from his guardians, the second surprised him; if he had previously entered into his that their imagination was a bad power residing in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guardians insisted that he left his friend and urged that his character to be terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous for sociology. He had been distraught, that his contempt for adultery had not origirated in hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratitude, that his victim, the partner of the guilt of hjs, should be cast out of the pinnacle of the virtue urisullie, the dawn at the lowest abyss af infamy and degradation: in the end, all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtuco, had, since his disrepair, even thrown the mask, and had not scrambled to excase that any deformity of their vicef in the public eye.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shaken a single luminous point on which to hold his eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to completely abandon the bim, purposive, intho mean, then, to monitor it more eloquently, and at 1 and not light circumstances go through the continued. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience if the daughter of the lady of whom he was head frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed by in all its windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the ruin of the innocent hair, although a tchettedloss girl. Losing rio shooting, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and hardly asked him for his respite intentions at the college, closing him at the time of the same that he knew he was about to meet her that night. Lord Rutbven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that everything would have had on such an occasion; and when he rushed if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Avbrey withdrew; and, immediately, by writing a note, to say, that from this moment, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and sticking to the mother of the lady, irritated him with all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to his daughter.\nIt is the character of his Lordship. The transfer was prevented. The next day, Lord Ruthven sent his sergeant more often to riot his complete assemblage at the separation of coal; but did not mention any suspicion as to his plans having been thwarted by the intersection of Aubrey.\nhaving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greeco, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon became accipehim by tracing to faded records of ancient glory on the monuments apparently, shame of chronicling the acts of free men only before the slave, had hidden under the floor sheltoring or many colored llchen. Under the same roof as him, there existed a being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed fashion 1 for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mahoinet, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone could be among those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle, a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, taming the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal adapted hut to the taste of an epic. Ananthes stop of light often accompanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and osten went to the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly Kashmere, showed that all his beauty of his form, flooaling as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters he just made in a tabiet almost erased, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the delicate such ray brilliantly and quickly erasing himself, he might well cause the oblivions of the anliquary, which let escape from his mind the very obicct that he had before taking vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and narcotic balls. As he drew the remains of what he wanted to prepare a memorial for his future hours, he stoned it, and looked at the mogic effects of his pencil, tracing the views of his place riative; she would then describe to revive the waxing upori dance the open plain, painted, to him, touching the oolourf bursting from the memory of the youth, the marriage pump remembered having seen in his infamy; and then, turning to subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on the mind, would tell them all the supernatural tales of his nurse. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which bcld passed years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear bonds, forced at the year, by nourishing the life of a beautiful woman to spread her existence for the months who followed her blood would run cold, while he tried to draw her from so many idle and horrific fantasies; but Ianthe quoted for a hlm the nclms of old men, who had not detected among them for the last time, after several of their relatives relativity and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of the friend; arid when she found him so unbelievable, she begged to believe him, for he had been pointed out that those who had deroved their existence, ohways bad some evidence given, which forced him, with confessing him and the true heart. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror intensified, hearing a very precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the supreme power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey begari to become more and more attached to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virtues of the woman among which he had sought for his vision of love, won his hell; as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still he has been increasingly attached to the sorm of Alinoste fairy before him. At times he would tear her up, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he would go away and decide not to return until her object had been reached; but he always supported him impressively to focus his attention on the ruins around him, who was in his mind, he kept an image that seemed to be the only rigid possessor of his thoughts. Nathan wasn't convincing of her love, and was always the French children's samo being having first known. She has always separated herself from him with respect; but she has a wall because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite events, that I occupied her warden in the sketch or the discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped from the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, confirmed their existence, the pale of horror in the name of the story. Shortly afterwards, Auhrey torpedoed to make one of his excursions, which holds him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him not to come back at night, as he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the closed hod day, on any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to search the way to the Jr. Aubrey made one look at their representations, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw the trembling at his daring class to mock a superior, infernal power, the same riam of whooh apparently made their blood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for the excursion without lingering; he was surprised by the obsessive-\nthe melancholic side of its host. He mocked the belief of these horrible fools, who had inspired them by such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, squatting fervently from him to return, the past night allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not understand that the light of the day was about to end, that on the horizon there were a few spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass tremendous, and shed all their rage on the devoted country .— He at 1st, however, found his horse, determined to catch 6th speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern calamates, is the unknown almosl; immediately the sun goes down, the neighborhood begins; and it had advanced far, the power of the storm was above — its aching thurders barely bad the ari de resl interval — its heavy heavy rain forced its way through the canopy leaflet, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate its feet. Suddenly, his horde became afraid, and he began to carry with terrible speed through the entangled entanglement. The animal stopped, the fatigue stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the masses of dead water and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find another true thing in the city, or at least true.\nto get a shelter from the shovel of the storm. As he approached, the Lunders, inflaming themselves for a moment, gave him the opportunity to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with the suffocated and exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised: but, awakened by the bumblebee that the agairi was rolling on his head, he, mixing himself with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He found himself himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He found himself in contact with some one, which he immediately seized; when a voice shouted ,\"Agari bafflied !\" to which a great laugh succeeded; and he felt himself beaten by one whose strength seemed superhuman: deterriod to sell his life as dear as he could, he struggles with him.\nBut it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and cast a common force against the earth; his enemy fell upon him, and knelt down on the breasts of bis, had put his bands on his throat, when the glare of many toro-\nHcs penetrating through the holc that gave light in the day, disturbed it ;— he rose instantly, and, lacring his prey, blushed through the door, and just for a moment the crushing of the fathoms, as the wood breaks, was heard from longer. The story was still there, and Aubrey, able to move, made himself heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the black glued on each individual straw with heavy soft flakes. At the desiro brewery, she was being searched for who had drawn her up with shouts of beer; he was again in darkness; but what was his borbor, when the light of the torches once again burst him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a course without me. He closed his eyes, hoping that he will but a vision coming from this disturbance; but he again saw the same shape, that he closed them, stretched by his fidc. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was silence lowering his face that sect almost as endearing as the 1 rise that the one lived there :— on his neck and breost was blood, and on his throat there were marks of blood having opened the vein :— so that men might point, weep, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter was formed quickly, and Aubrey was lacked by the side to the af she who had already been for him the object of so many straight visions and faith, now fallen with the flower of life that was dead with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the search, and to take refuge in the journey. He held almost consciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been his in the cabin. They were soon wearing a different part.\nThose who had been involved in his mother's search had not been fed well. Their lamentable weeping, as they approached the city, warned parents of a terrible catastrophe. \" To describe their sorrows would be impossible; but when they assured the cause of the child decline, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. Tobey was incoriable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey was put to bed with a very violent fever, so the arid was often delusional; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he rented. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rutbven, was lucky at that time to arrive at Athens, and, from any motivation, upon hearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the house, and became his constant steward. The one who recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished to see the image he had had of him, and he joined in the that spirit of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their frustration, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and ore that he showed, soon reconciated his presence. His seigneury felt completely changed; he no longer seemed to be optimistic that who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his cavalescence began to be rapid, he gradually agonized in the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference compared to the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his game fixed with insistence on him, with an inconceivable smile of exultation playing upper his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthuen will apparently commit to looking at the tideless waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the neckless sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much curved, and this elasticity of the evil which the mind once so distinguished now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his spirit would not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the rules he used to frequent, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the modest violet; then suddenly, would turn around, show to his wild imagination, his pale and wounded throal face, with a sweet smile on the bear's lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each feature of which created such bitter assailations in his reindeer. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom which was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, while they should visit the parts of Greece neither had seen again. They washed in all directions, and sought every place where a memory could be attached; but while they hadtened from one place to another, they did not take into account what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which were part of the world.\nwere only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those women whom they defended from claimed dangers. In the consecration of this neglecting the councils of the inhabitants, they traveled only with one seamstress, more for servo af guided as a defon case. However, by sinking, at the bottom of which, a narrow defilement was the bed of a torrendl, with masses of rock lorges descended from the nearby precipices, they could not repent of their negligence; for they barely surrendered to the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when the whistling of the bubbles closed their head, and by the reported echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left the helmet, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the part came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the shelling and turned the defilement: but shameful to be held by a soe, wbo with insulting cries the hadith ad van, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the robbers were to mount the above and bring them to the rear, they immediately decided to go forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in his shoulder, which brought him the land. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no danger, preventing the contest, he is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards hastening, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately refloat their arms and faint.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon induced his wounded friend to a neighboring hut; and having reached an agreement on a ransom, it was not inorted to be distracted by their presence — they were simply absent from guarding the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which which had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days of mortification followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His constancy and appearance had not changed; he felt as unconscious of the pain of he had been objects about him: but to the cause of the last evening, his mind became apparently urease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his help with more than the usual seriousness —\" Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I listened to death if my existence is small as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little of my life flourishes, I cannot explain all this, but if you hide everything you know about me, my hanour was fréo de la spot iri la rneuth du monde, and if my affair was unknown for some time to learn English —I—but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising him with exultant violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, wonder that, year and day, you will not lose your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or that you wage war yourself. \"The eyes of this seemed to burst out their bases ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ;\" He ran down and laughed on his foot, and no longer shook.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attended to his knowledge with his man arose on himself, and he did not know why; when he rebuked his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, if of the presentiance of this something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left his body. When a thief met him, arid informed him that he was no longer there, having been coveted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the pinriacle of a nearby mountain, coordinating to a promise that he had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes devouring men, decided to go on burying him in the place where he slept. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found nolrace from here the body or clothes, brandish the thieves were they pointed out the identical stone to which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was perplexed in the corijectures, but he finally came back, conspired that they had buried the body for the love of all the clothes.\nWeclry of a country in which he had met such terrible misfortunes, and in which al-I apparently conspired to increase that superstitious melancholy Ihat had grasped on his mind, he resolved to leave, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or to couples, he took care of organizing the effects of those he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthuen. There have been other cases containing several weapons, more or less suitable to violate the victims' death. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. As he killed them, and examined their curious forins, what was his surprise at finding a fheath apparently ornamented in the school style while the dogger laid down in the fatal hut — he fuddered — eager to get other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror could be imagined that he discovered that he was bleeding, although particularly shaped, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted to be wary; but the particular form, the same diversities on the haft and the fheath were also in the splendor on the boème, and I have no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home in Rome, his first inquiries were searching for the lady he had tried to catch Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. His parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and some hope has not been the beard since the departure to his secretary. The Aubrey spirit became almost burned under so many repeated horrors; it was afraid that this lady had been the victim of the native destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only job succeeded in exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he wanted to see. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swept him over the English coasts; and he hastened to reach the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the burnings and caresses of his fist, all the memory of the past. If before, through her child care, she had taken her attention, once that the woman began to appear, she became even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid look applause from the salon assembly. There was not any light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. The blue eye was never raised by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy c charm on this subject which did not seem to arise from the inconvenience, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and pensive. Alone, her face shines with a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection...\nAnd would she forget in her presence those deed that she knew to rest her rest, which would show off her smile for that of the vocabulary? It seemed as the eyes are — this face is weird, then plays in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only eightteen, and had not been introduced to the world. It was thought that their herguardians were gnawing that her propensity should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, when being her protector. It was now resolved that the next living room, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its country in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have been denied in the house of his fathers, and fed melancholy that had overcome him. He could not feel interested in the services of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the ones he had witnessed; but was determined to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came into the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, haftened there. Aubrey was l here with her sister. Let him stand in the ring by himself, without mingling with all that surrounds him, committing himself in the memory that the time he had seen Lord Rulhuen waf in that same place, he felt so fondly grasped by the arm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in the ear of his –\"Remember your goal .\" He had little courage to turn, fea rvl de searching for a specter that bluffed him, when he permeated, within a short distance, the same figure which had drawn his attention to this place up to on his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and pushing a possession into the crowd, he threw himself into the big car, and was a driver at home. He passed the room with pressed steps, and fixed the hands of half on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts were inflamed by the brain of this. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath .— He woke up, he could not believe that he could — death hung on !— He thought that this imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to return to society; although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name was hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few years later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leggling her under the protection of a matron, he gave the irito a pause, afraid there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. When he finally saw that many were leaving, he woke up, and in another room, found his sister surrounded by several appeared-\nHe tried to pass by and pass by, when one of them, who asked him to move, turned around, and began to flout these traits, he abhorred them most. He went forward, grabbed his sister's arm, arid, with a hurry, and forced her to the street: He found him, if he were hindered by the multitude of servarites waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing by, he heard again this voice whispering near him :«Remember your father !\" He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister bis, soon touched the house.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before he had the evil mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more empolelly was he absorbed, now that the certainty of the monsler's life again pre --\nSedon on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now irritated, getting bogged down in vain that she intimidated her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He only read a few words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His death surprised him ;—was he hc then so that this monster would wander, bearing the rule on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not avoid his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if we had to break his oath, and decipher his suspicions, who would believe Hiin? He was thinking of deploying his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he remembers, had already mocked beer. For days, remain in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he no longer captures calm and loneliness, he leaves his house, wanders from street to street, hastens to steal this image that flouts him. His dress became nominated, and he wandered, as often exposed to the Monday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; he returned with the evening to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue avoided him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by hif ahsence to all of his friends, with a friend among them, whose practice they were not connected, he determined to enter society again, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But that he entered a room, his baggard and his suspicious eyes were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister was not also forced him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to instil, arid, fearing that his mind would be wary of the aljené, they thought it was high to regain the trust that had previously been imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDosirouf to save him from the wounds and sufferings that he had to encounter in his wanderings, and to prevent him from expressing the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they engaged a physiciari to reside in the house, and constantly take care of them. He hardly appeared to notice, so completely was the mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally manifested itself so serious, that he was correlated with his character. He often lied about bad days, unable to be woken up. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and recollection was manifested at the entrance of his sister; then he was going to begin something, and, sawing his hands beer, which looks that were increasingly afflicting him, he wanted not to touch him. \"Ob, don't touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, as was the case, she asked whom it was necessary to answer, her only answer was :\"True! True !\" And again sank in a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. This lasted for some mary moriths: however, little by little, as the year passed, hif incoheronces became less frequent, and the mind has threw a part of its morosity, while its guardians observed, that several times in the day to count on his fingers, a number of firiitis, then smile.\nThe time of Tbe had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of the bis guards entering the room began to overwhelm with his doctor on the melancholyclstance of Aubrey being in such a horrible situation, when the bis sister was going the next day to be stowed. Instantly, Attrition of Aubrey will attracted; he shuddered with anxiety to whom. Happy with this brand of intellectual reform, because they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Marsden Cell. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubroy seemed happy, and astonished them even more by his exasperation of his intention to be a prostent among the nuptiols, and desiring her sister. They did not answer, but by sewing for minutes, his sister struck him. He was apparently agony able to be attracted by the influence of his pretty smile; if he pressed her to his bravery, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing the thought of his brother his more lively being to the feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his won warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the exploits of the monster who had influenced his life so long. He grabbed the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled it under foot. On her asking why he destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked like if he did not understand her, then taking his hands and looking with a frenzy of countermeasures, he told her to swear that she would marry this monster, because he — but he was able to push the riots forward — it seemed to him that he remembered his oath — he suddenly shook, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole, and bought that it was only a return of a bif disorder, overlaid, and the forcing from Miss Auhrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell upon his brothers, and begged, and begged them to delay, but for the day. They, attributing this to the madness they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, were striving to paoify him, and retired.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the salon, and had been refused with all the lessons. When he heard of Aubrey's disease, b, he understood again to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be felt among those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened at the height of his former companion, and by his attendance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Avrey rut. What could I resist his pagan? His language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of oneself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself ;—uld such as how, as he knew her, his existence, child began to seem worthy of preservation, except that he could have his accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of serperit, or sueh was the will of destiny, that he won his affective. To the title of the failing elder branch to him, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take room the day before his departure for the conciliator.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physian on his tutors, tried to bribe the servants, but in Japan. He asked for a pen paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conveying beer, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The sons promised they would have been able to give him the doctor, but when he gave him the doctor, he thought it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. And Aubrey heard, with a horror that could be picked more easily than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and he found the carts that shoved his ear. The Aubrey grew up almost French. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame vigilance, gradually leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a connection was held in the room, and in a moment was in the range where all were almost assembled. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by, rushed him out of the room, without ardour. When on the stairs, Lord Ruthven groaned in his ear :\" Remember your oath, and know, if not my wife, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his talent, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to pick him up. Aubrey couldn't support the loriger.\nWear himself; his rage has no shooting vent, had broken cold blood-vessels, it passed on to your bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was rioting the present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nHarry's weakness has worsened; the outpouring of blood-produced symptoms of the approach to death. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when midnight had passed, he told me in a composite way that the reader had pervated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards sought to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthuon had disappeared, and Every sister had slipped the deepest of a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the archipelago of Grecion, aboard one of the ships of his Majefty, in 1882, we put into the provost of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of rattles and vegetables still have there, lead many British ships to visit it — warmen and merchants; and there is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its bodies completely repay for the deviation of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the meri were used to water, and the sacrillier bargaining for the cottle with the tho nationals, the clergy and myself took rambled to the school of Homer cave, and other places where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four peas before our arrival in his selucque. \"He hired me as a pilot,\" the Greek sidetbe ,\" ridden me with him; but I do not have chaos to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird and very good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gavoDominick, the wirie-trador, six hundred zechins for il ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, raugh rioting constantly; so he said in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account greatly exalted the curiosity of the ovary, and we did not waste time hastening from the house that our peasant had resided. We were kindly received by an old mori, whom he led us to the mansiori. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a closet space. They were all simply decorated: plain grey walls, mclrble tab on each side, a large myrtle in Ihe ceritre, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be made to play through tho branobes by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venvs in a bent posture; a sofa or sofa large completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and is an empty library: there was no e....\nThere is no paint. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two quilts of stuffed cotton and a pillow – the common bed throughout the circle. In the sitting room, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books and papers, which were there in the chest of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in examining the contents. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousscau compiete, VolneysRuins of Empires, Zimmerman, in German Languac, the Messiah of Klopstook, the novels of Kotzebue, Schillers play of the Robbers, Milton Paradise Lost, an Ital-\nfair condition, printed in Parma in 1810; leaflets of Severol small from the Greek press al Constantinople, much torri, but was born in an English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, says how, they must lie there until his return; far he is his particular, that is, if I move a thing without order, he would frown on Mc for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I made him a servico, and I have products of his farm for the evil of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechlings which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the Lord has scrambled here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the house of the table is very pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps long and wide front, and the canned marble pillar with plintbs black and the freight work cornices ,( as it is now usual in the Grocian architecture ,) were consideredably hibber quetbe raof. The roof, surrounded by a high-height stone balustrade, was wrapped by a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen string. Most of the roofs of the house are thus overturned, as on them the Greeks spend their smoking evenings on, drinking light wines, such as \"lacbryma Christian\", eating fruit, and overjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the house, a small stroamlet glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens were escaped together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we were told, the Lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very fervent, and always attached-\nWe finished our church twice a week, on Sundays leaps .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be called the 6th \"bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eyes to Mounl Calclo, covered with olive trees and myrtical trees on the blooin, and a top of which an ancient Greek tempio appeared in majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as the glass, arid a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ended the view forward; and a little on the left, through a view of high palm chesriut clouds, several small islands were observed dislinctly, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely liked a view more than I did; but our eriquiries were fruitifications as to the narna of the person who had resided in this romantic solitaire: no one knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"but I am sure he won't do it,\" and can you do it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had bet young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with him at the bridal sea. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cartoons arid silk to the girls who live there weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, the Greek Testaments were often given to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, frowning all that we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very valiant daughter, whose lord was often seen walking by the sea, and he had bought him a piano-fortée, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which we left the island of Mltylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who could be this logger in Greece. He obvious inoney will: ho ho ho philanthropy disposition, and all these which eccentricties brand a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Failling in a company with Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The iridividuel,\" he said ,\" that you are so anxious is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him with Mitylene .\" We have never heard of the same secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the clause of Capital on every page. Did we not regret not being more curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I render this status, believing it is not entirely uninteresting, and is justice in the good name of his secretary, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to the assemblage of human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can both clearly gathered fried these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of bis Lordship, seem to have their scat in his bosom. Tendress, sympathy and charity cling to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is a reasori sor avenir marking the thing as a being in whose heart religion put his sea, clinging to the head of the Bible Volunteer has thrown his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Pensions will never be recorded....\nIndeed, whoever dares to justify himself before this horrific trial where he must appear, only he can censor the errors of another death. Lord Byron's character is worthy of the genius himself. Doing good to you in secret, and feeling the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of the virtuous heart and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Peter, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "33": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is stuffed is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: he did not, comment, extend it to the Greeks until after the establishment of the Christianity; and he only assumed his present from Siric the division of the Lalin and Greek churohes; at that time, the idea of being dominant,tal a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the suffering of many stories wonderful, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrairie, where the helif exists, that the vampyres soaked in harm by a certain part of the blood of the victims of cercir, which emaculated 6 th, lost strérigth, and died quickly of consumption; while these oily blood suckers were fattening — and their volunts were distending such a state of reconstitution, as to cluster the blood at flow of all passages of their bodies, and even of the poros even of their skins.\nIn the Journal Londori of March 1732, is an evil, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, what would have happened in Modreyga, Hungary. It seems, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and of the judges of thopaea, that they unanimously affirmed, that, about live years before, a certain, he wrote, named Arnold Paul, had heard to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a uampyre ,6 found a bad way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vomit, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent harm from becoming a vainpyro hefelf; sor, about twenty or thirty days after bis death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid new disorders, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, taken the body, and found (as it supposed to be usual in the course of vampyrism) fresh, completely free from erupting, and stirring in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. The having evidence was thus obtained, and he resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through the heart and badly of Arnold Paul, where it is reported to have also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. This drama, they cut off his head, burned the body of his, and threw the ashes into his grave. The same mouldings were adopted with the course of thososos who had already died of vompyism, lost, they should, in turn, become begles on the others who survived the larn.\nThe universe 1 believes so, that a person has sucked hy a vampyro becomes a vampyre hesels, and sucks in his moon.\nChief of the bail.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related to merc, as just seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations than the only other instance that might be presented. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of death penalty for a heinous crime committed by wbilsl in existence, that dead TB is not only condemned to vampyris, but forced to entrust his infernal visits only to those beings whom he loved inost while on earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A opposition refers to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and hate the land of birth, and suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight dread the flow of life: yet hate the banquet that performeth, that thou shouldest feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, even thy thyself shall be yet exhaled, and knaw the devil for their sire; as thou cursed, cursed hem, Your flowers are wrapped on the stem. But one of them for your crime must fall. The youngest, the best belved of April, will bless you with the name of a brother — This word will engulf your heart in flames! But you must damage your task and mingle with the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and let the last glassy look see what freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand without salvation, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the tenderest promise of Shourri Afferiori has been made — but now is supported by the Memorial of your opinion! But with the best of yourself, blood will swallow up; your squeaking tool, and Iip of haggard; Tben tracking at your tomb, Ga—and with Gouls and First rave, until those in horror distance themselves from more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Sotbey Bas also presented in his wild but beautiful paem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the young girl Arclbian Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave in order to torment him, whom she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to have resulted from the sinfulness of his life, being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocent. The true Tournefort makes a long story in his journeys of sweaty amazing cases of vampyrism, also which he claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on the subject thif, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and the illuminating tradilionary narratives of his effects, presented some dissertations learned, tending to prove that he is classic, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly horrible superstition could be added bc; although the present may suffice for the limits of a nole, necessarily devoted to exploration, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the orie in mofl general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use mado of in various parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vordoulacha, Gou1, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the altending dissipations on a writer London, a novel appeared to the various parts of the locks of the ton, more remarkable than his rank. He looked at the glimmer around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, he could, by a glance, stifle him, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Thus, who felt this sense of fear, could not explain from where he stood: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, who, staring on the face of the object, did not begin to penetrate, and with one glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; a bull fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been acoustomized to the full excitement, and now felt the boredom weight, were begged to have something in their presence capable of engaging their alteration. In spite of the mortal tint of her face, which has never gained a warmer tint, nor of the puff of modesty, nor of the strong emotion of passion, although its shape and its contours are beautiful, unavowed by female hunters to the abandonment of the notorie, who had intended to be wary of his attentions, and to obtain, at least often, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of each monfter in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw the herself into her woy, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention :— although unfaithful :— when she stood before him, although her eyes apparently fixed that of her, it seemed that they were not perceived ;— even her vnappal impudence was baffled, arid she left the field. But even if adultery could not influence even the direction of the eyes of this, there was no that the female fex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous wife and the innocent donut, while few knew that he was speaking to the females. However, he had the reputation of a grinning torrig; and if she even overcame the dredge of his character of chantulcler, or they were moved by his hatred of vice, he was like delen arn arg these females who boast about their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAbout the same thing, a young man named Avbrey arrived in London: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by the guardians, who, however, their duty simply took care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more important charge of his mind to the subaterns mercenary ore, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high Romanic feeling of honor and caridure, which every day destroys so many apprentices of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with nature, and thought that the voice was thrown iri by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: however, the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were so warm, but that were better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds encase various caloric patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for reasons that, when entering the gay circles, many demonstrations surrounded him, strangling who should describe with the least true their larguizing or snoring favorites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to many false notions of his talents and merit. As he was attached to the romance of his salitary hours, he marveled at finding that, exoep in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life. for none of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these uolomas, from which he had formed his studies. However, by finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, it was lowered to refine his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above, went through him in his career.\nHe observes it, and the same irresponsibility to form an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed in himself, who gave fcw other signs of his observation of external statements, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine all that flattered it is the prepensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a novel, and determined to observe the progeny of hls foricy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid him alterations, energized so to advance on his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon, from the preparation of the notes in — Slreet, realized that he was out to travel. Desiring to obtain information respecting this singular character, who, now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to make the tour, while for many genres hcls was deemed necessary to allow the young to do the same rapid steps in the career of vice-war ds pvttling themselves on equality with the old, arid not allowing that time to app oar af so fallen skics, each scandalous intrigues are deserved as subjects of plea or praise, according to the degree of skill they bring to bear them. They agreed: Arid Aubrey indifferently mentioned his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him call the proposal to join him. Flattened by a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with the other men, he rejoiced at having aceoped him, and in a few days they had passed the circling waters.\nHistory, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthveri, and now he found, tall, although much more of his actions were exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— the lazy, the vagaond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Avbrey was able to avoid making remarks, and it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the inissortunes even attending on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— tbee was sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his wishes, but to allow him to lose himself in his lust, or to finish bim still more deeply in his iriquiquity, he was sent away because of charity. However, this is attributed by him to the greater importance of the uicious, which generally prevails over the weakness of the retirement of the virtuous indiggent. There was a circumstance about the char of his Lordship, which was even more impressed by his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Auhrey was surprised by the apparent avidenoss with whom he sought the centres of all the modelable vices; he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the best known beat his anlagonist, and then he lost even more tuna than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which that he generally looked at society around: there was not, however, if he encountered the eruption young novice, or the luckless father of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstracledness of the wild spirit set aside, and his eyes sparked more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the mort-de-holf mouse. In every city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the solt ed of a downcon, the fate that had attracted him without the reach of this friend; while many fathers sat frantically, in the midst of speaking of silent hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play of the thing; but immediately lost, to ruin many, the last guilder whom he had just pulled from the oonvulsive hail of the innocent: this might but being the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which, however, did not coincide with the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved to be ruining all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for every day he jumped his friend would give him an opportunity to speculate frankly and openly at home; however, this never occurred. Lord Rutbven in his car, set in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his hislip; and although Avbrey waf near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the tough excitement of wanting vainly to break this mysticism, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the supernatural something operance.\nThey came to Rome, and Aubrey, for a time loft seen from his companion; he left him in the daily assistance on the morbid circle of an Ilalian countess, while he went in search of the ministers of another deserted city alone. While he was so erupted, letters came from the En gland, that he opened with a greedy embolism; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guards, the second surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was a bad power in his companion, they seemed to give him a fuffilent reason for the bliss. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and urgod, that his character was terribly victims, for the possession of irresistible powers of the scientist, made his unconscious habits more dangerous for society. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the partner of his guilt, should be yelled at from the pinnocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that the women who had been sought, apparently because of their future, had, from his departure, cast the mask apart, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of their vices to the public view.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous pear on which corrects the eye. He resolved to give him plausible reports to abandon him completely, telling him, in the middle while, to drop him more closely, and to leave no light circumstances passed by urinoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was conveying to work. upon the inexperience of the lady's daughter of which he frequented the chicfly house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; he was therefore obliged to pursue the plans in secret; but Aubrey's eye followed him in all his windings, and soon disclaimed that an asitation had been appointed, which ended the most evil in the rain of an innocent, tough daughter. Losing his time, he entered Lord Ruthvens party, and hardly asked him for his intonations about the Icldy, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her that night. Lord Rulhven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that he hated such an ocasiori; and after having been pressed if he intended to strangle him, only laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately wrote a note, to say that from this storm, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the remainder of their proposed visit. He ordered his servant to seize other apartments, and calling Japan the lady's mother, informed him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also about the character of his Lardship. The assignment was prevented. Lord Ruthven right day simply sent a hif servant to notice his complete ostent to a separation; bvt has not had no fuspicion of his plans having been defiled by Auhreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey heads for Greece, and crosses the peninsula, soon finds himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of O Greek; and soon took care to draw the sad documents of ancient glory on the monuments which, by chance, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many of Ijchen colovred. Under the same roof as herself, there existed a bcing, so beautiful and dolicat, that she could have formed the modol for a painter wanting to pour on the carivass the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for any oria to think that such might belong to those who had no soul. As she danced at the top of the plain, or the cllong tripod, we would have thought of the gazelle a poor type of his beauties; for whom would have exchanged his eye, apparently an animated ocular nature, for that drowsiness luxurious look of the adapted animal but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ionthe aftcri accompanied Avhrey in his search for antiquities, and the ostcn went the uriconscient girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, floating as it was on the wind, to the look of ogre os hiin, who forgot the litters that he came from deciphcred on ari compressed almost erased, in the contemplation of his figure of sylpha. Often, her braids would fall, as she wilted the oron, exhlbit in the ray of Thesun such delimenting brilliant and quickly discoloring the shades, he could excufe the forgetfulness of the antiquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before vitally importing the appropriate interpretation of passage in Pausanias. But why does the attempt to describe charms that are all seen, but not the appreciation ?— It was ineriocence, youth, and waterthy, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and stuffing balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the circular dance in the open plain, painted to him in all the flamboyant colors of the young memory, the marriage pump that she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning objects that had obviously made a glittering impression on his mind, brought him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His caress and his apparent belief in what she was telling aroused the very interest of Aubrey; and often as she told him the story of the living vampy, that he had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the following months, his blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe quoted him the names of old men, who had at last detected theories living between them, after several of their parents and children who had once found themselves marked with the stamp of their friends appetite; and when she found him so jncredule, begged him to rebel against her, if he had been, reinarked, hat thase who had dared to expel their exislence, always bad evidence given, which forced them to confess, with grief and sorrow, to confess. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror multiplied, by a fairly accurate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although at the same time, she wondered about many coincidences that all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the infected virlues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of laromance, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English robes, marrying a Greek girl unshakeable, still to find glarelf inore and more attached to the form of a fairy the most half before him. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plan for the sumptuous antiquarian search, he left, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruiris around him, which is in his mind he kept a that image seemed alone the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was aware of his love, and was still the same child, he had the Sirst Crown. She always seemed to break up with her reluctance; but it was no longer a case where she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that was still escaping from the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to out-of-parent parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, the pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which was to hold home for a few years; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged not to return to night, because it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever stay, after the day had closed, to any consideration whatsoever. They dethroned it as the kind of vampyte in the noctumal orgies, and denounced the roots of heavy evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their mouth. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to bring them out of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity so that you mocked a superior, infernal pagan whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next day, Morniring Aubrey left unattendedly for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy of his host, and he was concerned that his words, mocking the bellif of the terrible friends of the pipe, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to come back, and the night of the order allowed the power of these fools to be put into action ;— he promised. He cared so much about his reverence, that he did not perceive the light of the day, and that on the horizon. there was one of these which specks, iri the warmer climate, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost known; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it is bad advanced far away, the power of the storm wos ahoue — its thunders echoed barely an interval of rest — its heavy thick rain pierced its woy through the foliage of the cover, while the forked lightning has seemed to fall and radiate to its very effect. Suddenly his horse took straight, arid it was carried with a dreadful fast through the entangled forest. The animal stopped, the fatigue stopped, and he began to four, by the glare of the glare, and he was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that surrounded him. Desmount, he approached, hoping to find some one to guide a bim to the towri, or at least trust to get a shelter from the awning basin. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman mingling with the suffocating and exulting ridicule of laughter, contrived the almost with an uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised; but, awakened by the thunder, he gave Ovors head again, with a sudden force, sorcered, opened the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, the However, guided him. He is apparently inconceivable; although he collided, the sounds continued, and nothing was made of him. He found himself in contact with someone who seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Again gagged !\" to whom a strong fern felt harassed by him whose strength seized superhumans: determined to give himself his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vain: be lifted up from his feet and thrown with enormous force against the ground :— his cnemy fell upon him, and knelt on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat bis — when he dazzling many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, troubled him ;— he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in clomenl the crushing of the branches, as he broke the wood, will not hear him any more. The storm is still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon bearded by those without. They entered, and the light of their tears fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on all the iridividous straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubreys will, they went to the sea for the one who had attracted him with his cries; he was again Ift to destroy; but what was his horror, that the light of the torches once moro burst upon him, los perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor through a course without life. He shall hisoyes, hoping that it was only a vision that became clear from his disturbed imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, collapsed on the bis side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a buttock on his face that seemed to be as attached as the lily that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, on his throat were the marks of teeth that opened the vein :— to this man pointed, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A vampire! a vampire !\" A litter box was formed, and Aubrey was laid next to her who had recently been the object of so many brilliant visions and sadness, now fallen with the flower life that had died in her. He did not know what he had bought, his mind was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held unconsciously in his hand, a naked boulder, a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, signaled the traps of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grid would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death ,\" he looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the course. They were inconspicuous; both died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violet fever, and was often delirious; in the inlervals of which he called Lord Ruthven and upon Ianthe—by some incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the care he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, blessed at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from any move, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant servant. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrifiod and astonished at the sight of him whose image he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, his kirid words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by the attention, anxiety, and ear that he showed, soon the reconcilod to his presence. His lordsbip seemed completely changed; he no longer seemed to be apothetic when Aubrey was so ostensible; but, as soon as his opponent was fast, he gradually hung himself in the same state of mind again, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his staring intolerantly fixed on him, with a smile of maliciovs exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile had him. During the most difficult stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged to look at the tideless wave raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, encircled, like our world, the still sun ;—iride, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by the shock this, was much weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that had once so distinguished it now seemed to have fled to have had. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athons; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for the purple of the modosta; he turned suddenly, showing his wild imagination, his palc face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile lovating his lips. He determined to steal scenes, the characteristic of the euphoria that such associations created in his mind to bullet. He proposed to Lord Rutbuen, who is bound by the care he took of him during his illness, to visit these parts of Greece, and you had not seen. They traveled to all the regions, and looked for all the places that could have been attached to a complication; but although they were thus removed from the square, they did not seem to take into account what they were looking at. They have a lot of thieves, but they have gradually begun to diminish these relationships, which they imagined to be only the inventiveness of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result of this denial of the local council, they occasionally travelled with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. However, by seizing a narrow challenge, to the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they were right to repent of their neglectico; for they were hardly the whole party arose in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the beating of coffee bullets at their head, arid by the cold ratio of several gvns. Iri for a moment their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had started firing in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthveri and Aubrey, in imitating the example, withdrew for a moment behind the parking tower of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with insulting basins, sade them advance, arid being exposed to inflammation without resemblance, if any of the thugs should climb above and toggle them at the rear, they immediately decided to rush forward in search of the enemy. Barely, a bad they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a school in the tobe shouldor, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, is surprised to see the thieves' faculties about him, his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately thrown their arms and surrendered.\nBy the promises of a great response....\nAubrey soon pushed them to conuey hls wurid fried lo a neighhouring eclhin; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the presence though simply keeping the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthin quickly diminished; two days of mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His arid appearance had not changed; which seemed as incorruptible of the pain as he had been objects around him; but towards the O ose de tho last night, his mind became apparently unbreakable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, which was induced for his asjstanco with more than serious usage —\" Help me! I mean not my life, I listened to my death as little as that of the day passing; but you can save iny honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little of my life flourishes, I cannot explain everything — bvl if you hide all You know of me, my honor has freed itself from the stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death has been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising himself with exulting violene ,\"Swear by all your soul that, by your natural fears, swear that, for a dry year a day, you will not give to every living being on the way, whatever it is, or what you see, my crimes or my death. \" His eyes seemed energizing from their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, and did not breathe a mare.\nAubrey withdrew to roam, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose in the spirit, and he did not know why; when he remembered his clothes, a cold frenzy came upon him, or if the presentation of something horrible awaited him. From the beginning of the snoring, he was about to enter into the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, arid informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by himself and omrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise that they had given this seigneuria, that he had exposed himself to the first cold ray of the moon that rose after death bis. Avbrey is astonished, and takes the men's covers, decided to go and bury him in the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found the trace of the body or clothes, although the robbers swore that they had revealed the same rock on which he had laid the body. For some time, the spirit bis was perplexed in the pictures, but to be to last returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWearing a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all appearedryly conspired to pretend this superstitious melancholy which had selected himself on min d, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to Otranto, or to Naples, he occupied the helsels iri by arranging the effects he occupied with him belonging to Lard Steven. In other cases, there is one case of corruption and several cases of offence, more or less adopted to ensure the victims' mourning. There were several daggers and atagharis. While turning them around and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sbeat ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the big hut — he trembled — hastening to get other proos, who found the weclpan, and his horror can be imagined when he covered that he adjusted, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splondour on both, and did not leave any rooin sore; there were drops of blood also on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the way home, in Rome, his first investigations were on the lady he had tried to remove attractive arts from Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in the distros, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departure of her secretary. The Aubrey spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had falsified a victim at the Iantho destroyer. He bocamed inorose and silent; and his only oecupatiori consisted of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the loss of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which began to obey his will, soon tumbled him on the English coasts; and he hastened to the translation of his fathers, and thore, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri, embracos and caresses of his sister, ail memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, had gained its effect, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as an acoination.\nMiss Auhrey didn't just win thanks, which wins the game and the appearance of drawing-roin assemblage. There was none of this light shining that normally exists in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. Thore was a melancholic charm around him that did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some expense inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter recall. His step was not that the foot, which strays where to wear a butterfly or a color can attract – it was sedate and consecutive. When Alonc, his caress was never grieved by the smile of joy; but when the brother ever watered his affection to her, and in his presence would have forgotten these deed sbe could destroy his rest, what would his smile have exchanged for that of voluptuous time? It seemed that these eyes, this face then played in the light of our own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not introduced Bcen to the world. He was thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation if he tarried until the return of his brother of the coritinate, when he could be his protector. It was now, in this sense, that the hot salon, which was quickly opposed, was to be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". He would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and fed on the bicycle that overpowered her. He could not feel interested in the offashionable strangler frivolous, when his mind had so torn the events that he had seen; even he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They came to Lownn, and prepared for the next day, which had announced 6th as a salon.\nThe crowd was empty – a drawing room had not been held for a long time, arid all those who were impatient with books in the kingdom still, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he stood in a corner, without taking into account all that was around him, engaged in the remorse that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that place where the urn was, he suddenly felt him sequestered by the arrn, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear ,\"Remember your oath\". He had little courage for turri, eager to see a spectre blow to him, when he was perceived, within a short distance, the same figure that had drawn the attention of the hjs on this point until his first entry into society. He looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, arid was taken home. He grabbed a piece of table with pressed steps, and he put his hands on a layer of bis, as if he were afraid his kicks would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him— circumstances started in the terrible farniente—the dagger—the oath bis .—He shaved itIf, he could not believe possible—the death rose again !— He thought his imagination had conj-\nured up the image on which his mind leaned. It was impressive that it could be real — so he determined to go back to society; for, although he had enslaved Lord Ruthven, the riame having on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He left a few nights later, his sister at the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, finally, whom many were leaving, he awakened, and when entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; which attempted to pass and approach her, when the one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and dragged him these traits that he most abhorred. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a foot-to-foot in a hurry, he set her on the street; and when he began to stand by the multitude of servants, he waited for the lords of the LORD; and while he was committed to passing over them, he heard this voice murmur with him again, saying ,\"Remember your oath !\", he dared not turn, but, hurry up his sister, he soon came to his house.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before the high mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more complete it was grossod, now than the certainty of the life of the monster once again pressed on his purchases. Her sister's attraction was no longer listened to, and it was in a vairi that she intimidated him to send to her what had caused him to lead abruptly. He said only a few words, and that terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oats surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to gratify, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all being endured, and not to avoid his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if he wanted to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from evil; but death, he remembered, had already mocked the beer. For days, he remained in his condition; locked in his room, he saw no one, and clinged it only when his sister came, only with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, his sake, to sustain nature. Finally, no danger is able to carry stillness and loneliness, he raised his house, wandered from street, anxious to steal this image that disturbs him. His dress became neglected, and he prepared, as often exposed to the sun of the day of Naon as to the humidity of the midnight. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned with envy to the house; but at last he put him at dawn to rest where Fatjgue had invaded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to sabotage him; but they were soon removed by him who fled a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that he left by his absence, he all his friends, with a friend among them, of the trick that they were unconscious, he determined to go to enter again into society, and closely watch him, anxious to predict, even despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his rogue and suspicious eyes were so dreadful, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that touched the home so much. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakable, the guards thought that it was necessary to intervene and, fearing that his mind would rejoice, they took the time to take back the test that Aubreys parents had imposed on them.\nDesiring to save the bim from the wounds and sufferings that we have had every day in the wanderings, and to make it pass from expassion to the geriatric eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hire a doctor to stay in the house, and take care of him. He was not afraid to notice it, so that competently, his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great, that he was confined to his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had emaculated himself, his eyes had reached a vitreous Iuster ;— the odious sign of affection and of the remaining recollection was manifested on the entrance of the bis sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that greatly affected him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked who he referred to, her only was the answer ,\"True! True !\" And once again, he sank in a state, when not even if she could wake him up. In recent months: however, little by little, if the ycar passed, its inconsistencies became frequent, and the bis spirit threw a part of its morosity, while his guards observed, which he counted once in the day on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy circumstance of being Aubrey alone. such a terrible situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Instantly, Aubrey's attentist was coupled; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this intelligent return mark, which they feared had been deprived of, they mounted the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that this was a young count he met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, afraid wanting to separate from his sister. They did not answer, but in an instant his father was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the idea that his brother was once again to the feeling of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate him on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on his chest;0 for what a surprise to see the characteristics of this monster that has influenced his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why to be so despised the resemblance of his future husband, he looked at cls if he rioted without clasping her — by grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression of face, he swore that she would not marry this monster, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice shouted again to remember his oath — he turned suddenly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In addition, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, attached themselves to the fact that it was only a return of his disorder, entered, afraid of having fooled Miss Aubrey, desired that she release him. He fell on his knees as far as them, implored, begged them to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the soundlessness they imagined, took possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him and withdrew.\nLord Rutbven had elated in the morning after the living room, and became refused with every other. When one heard of Aubreys ill health, he could not be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be inferred from those among whom he had obtained his information. He hastened to the house of the former companion, and, through the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his sate, which gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who would resist his power? His tongue had dangers on the toils to tell—could speak like himself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, except with herto whom he addressed him 1st;—could say how, since he knew her, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of precrvation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;—well, he knew well how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch falling to him at Lengtb, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place the very day of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physician and his guards, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his fister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who now in the grave, who ate her held her in their arms as their boop and the boop of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marrlage, on which to denounce the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver JT; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Mifs Aubreys spirit any more by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than described, the notes of the occupied preparalion. The morning came, and the discovery of cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vivacity, they gradually stole, leaving him the guard of an old woman powerless. He drunk the occasion, with a tie, was out of the room, and in a moment smiled at the accident that all was almost assembled. John Ruthven was the first to set him up; he heard immediacy, and, throwing his arm by the witch, he rushed him into the room, and cried furiously. On the stairs, Lord Robin rang his ear :\" Remember your oath, and know that if my bride is not today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So, he pushed him to his companions, and the old woman pushed him into fear. Aubrey could support himself longer; his rage had no running vent, had broken uossel blood, arid he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake it. The wedding was so...\nThe bride and husband left London.\nAbbreys weakness increases; the blood frusjon produces symlomas of the riary approach to death. He wanted his sister guardians to be called, afraid when midnight had passed, he would tell in a composite way what the reader had hit, he died immediately after.\nThe guardians quickly protected Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and the sister of Aubrey had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was everyone asked him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN A sail across the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 18 l 2, we spent only the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this plateau, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always to be there, lead many British vessels to visit it — both warmen and merchants; arid though it is out of the rack for ships linked to Smyrna, his bountief mainly repays for the deviation of the voyage of cl. We landed, as usual, at the beluga of the Billy, and while the men were employed to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical. and I took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and other places, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Sclo with an English lard, but left the field four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have a takon line with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the different fields .\"\nThis account aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time seeing the nozzle that our compatriot lived in. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: a living room, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet. They were all picked up in mermaid: green walls of piclin, marble tables on the side, a large myrtle iri center, and a small fountain below, which could play to through the branches by making the masonry of a spring fixed on the side of a single bronzo Venus in a lean posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the ball stood half a dozen English cone chairs, and an empty library: the gorges were mirrors and, nora, a single painting. The litter had only one large mattress that extended the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and one pillow, the most common in Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a great sailor's best in the closet: it was opera, but we did not think ourselves justified by examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerinan, in the German language; Klopstock Messias; Kotzebues novels; Schiller's play of the Robbers; Milton Lost Paradise, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the pamphlets of the Greek press from Tbe to Constanlinople, much tom, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were marked with noles, margirials, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiab was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with briefs of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had read the books of the evening before he sailed, and forgoled to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special that if I move the thing without order, it would frown upon me for the week lodger; it is in other very good ways. I have one day done a service; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins whom I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cotton evil 1 in the wood, and which the Lord brought here from Adrlanople; I do not know for the reason of war .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now temporary in Greek architecture ), were considered higher than the roses. The roof, topped by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful Turkish carpet, under a golden linen awning. Most of the house roofs are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks pass their energy by smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, arid while enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left-hand harid, as we entered the house, a small stream slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees gathered together on his barders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seat was placed with an ornamental wood back, and we were told that the first party of his evenings and years had been spent until twelve o'clock, rescuing, writing and speaking thus himself. \"I suppose\" said the old man, praying ,\"for he was very fervent, and always attended hur church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe blue brake this waf seat which can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, scattered with 0 life and myrtle trees in flowers, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until the woods were lost near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as bright, and ari horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, termiratef the view in front; and a little on the left, through a vista of high chiefnue and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the blue wave light with spots of emeric green. I rarely had a view more than I did; but our investigations were without results as the name of the person who had lived in this romantic salitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armeniani\" said our conductor ,\"could say it, but I sure he won't say it,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolatodic lord. He had a splendid eight young girls when he was the last person of the island, and even danced with them at the bridal sea. He gave the cow to a man, the horses to the fathers, and the ton of bed and silk to the daughters who live by weaving articles of these. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, we have appeared, from all that we have collected, to have been an eccentric and benevolent very character. A circumstance that we have learned, which over an old friend to the bottle considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking by the sea, and who had been bought a piano-strong, and who had been taught to use it himself.\nSuch information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of dispofition, and all those eccentricities that mark particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling with Mr. FOSTER, the archicotcot, a WYATTLE puppy, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so worried, is Lord Byrori; I greet him on my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I visit him in Mitylene.\" We then had to be the first of the fame of the seigneury bis, as we had been some of them from the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluscal bone on each page. Didn't we regret not having been more meritorious in our reservations at the cottage, but we were able to solve our lives with the idea of returning to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice to the good dwarf of her secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as a dispositiori is insensitive, opposed to assoiating with the British literature, or contributing in any way to soothe its pains, or to add its folds. The fact is directly inverse, as can be clearly gathered from these small anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness, the rest of solitude, is an additional rossard to mark him as a being upon whose heart, religion shall sell his sole, and upon whose pearl the Benevolence cast his coat. No man has read the preceding \"traits\" without feeling....\nHe is proud of him as a countryman. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships must always be received with water, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself seizes the horrible court where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byrori's character is so worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, arid fills the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approved consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "34": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition on which this story is smiling is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: however, he did not extend his sons to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and he assumed his present somme only from the divisjon of the Latin and Greek Churches; at that time, the idea being predominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were enraged in the territory of Ihera, he gradually increased, and formed the subject of many stories of woridersul, still existing, of dead thc rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it extended, with seeds of variation, also on Hungclry, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where there was the belief that the vompyres nightly imbibeda cortain portion of the blood of their victims, which became emaciated, lost their strength, and specifically died of consumption; while the human blood suckers fattened it — and their veins became distended to a state of repletion, as for cave the flow of blood ta from all passages of their body, and even from the pores very of their skins.\nIri, the London Journal, of March ,1732, is a curious, and, from the course, credible account of a case of particular of uampyrism, which is called to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they declared pofitivcly and unanimously, that, about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named ArnoId Paul, hod bc heord to say, that, in Cossevja, ori therontiers of the Turkish varia in Tbc, it was bad was tormented by a vampy, hut had found a way to get rid of evil, eat part of the earth from the tomb of the vampy, and rub with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming an evil vampy; for 6 out of twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of the hearing beaked by him, and a statement was made, that four evil people were deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagrii, took the hody, found clnd (as it supposed to be usual in case of vampyrism) fresh, clnd completely free of corruption, and emitting a tbo inouth, nose, and ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was obtained, they resolved the usual remedy. A stake was completely led through Arnold Paul's breast and body, where he would have cried as terribly as if he had been alive. It was done, they cut off his pearl, burned his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of the person who had previously died of vampyrism, let them, in their time, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe European Union\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of usher.\nThe monstrous this rodomontode here is bound, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the observations present than any other instance that could be produced. Iri of many ports of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after the case, for heinous crimes care combined while in existence, that dead babe is not only sentenced to vampyrise, but forced to limit her infernal visits only to those beings that he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes to in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on earth, Vampyre keys sent, And thy horn shall be torn from his sepulchre; and when thou hast haunted the place of origin, and sucked the blood of all thy sap: there shall thy davghter, sister, wife, shall be broken, about midnight drain the stream of life: yet hate the banquet that is to strike thy livid the corsc driving, the victims of Tby, and they shall perish again, and Shall know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But the one who, for your crime, must fall, touch the youngest, the best blind of all, Diffuse with the name of a father — This word will envelop your heart! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last cloth of his cheek — the 1st spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a bare hand, will tear the braids of his yellow hair, including, in the face, a lock when the most tender pledge of affection has been worn — but now you are carried by the Memorial of your agony! Yel with thy awri, the best blood shall flow; thy grafting tooth, and the lip of the hook; and hunting at the tomb, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in the horror of the shririk far from the cursed specter than they.\nMr Southoy also presented in his wild and majestic poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire of the good Arabic to Oneiza, which is represented by bones having rendered the grave fram for the priest to torment him whom she loved during her existence. But this cannot be pleased to have been the result of the sin of her first, being poured out throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tovrnefort gives in Iong counts in his travels several astonishing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work up to on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes bones, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, low has presented some dissertations learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that though the term Vampyrejs that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, made us in various parts of the world: Cls Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the accompanying discussions upon a London winner, he appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the glamour around him, because he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew only attention, which he sighed with a look, will fade out, and cast fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. From where this sense of fear arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, extending on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pieree through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the check with a radius of lead that weighed on the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be invited to all the houses; the angel wised to pay him, and those who were accustomed to violating the excitement, and now felt Erinuis weight, were happy to have something in their hairy presence to age their attention. In spite of the deadly tint of her face, which never gairi a warmer tint, eitber of lho blush of modesty, or of the strong emolion of passlon, although her beautiful clrid contour wero, many female hunters after notoriety tried to gain her attention, and to win, at the leost, some marks of what they might call the affliction: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of every monster worn in the drawing rooms from her rnarrioge, threw himself in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a moonbank, to attract her attention :— although in ualn :— when she stood before bim, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, it still seemed that they were unperceived ;— even her unapplied impudence was flouted, and she left the field tho. But the common adulterer could not infuse even the direction of her eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman arid innocent girl, that few ever knew that he added himself to the women. However, he had the reputation of a winning torigue; and that he was even too dreaded by the bis-singular character, as that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like howteri among the female hosc who formed the boast of the sex of these ultra domestics, as among those whom he shoved by their vices.\nAt about the same time, he arrived in London, a young man named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great sweat, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Bequeathed also to himself by guards, who thought it was their duty simply to care for his fortune, while they abandoned the most important shade of his mind to take care of subaltem mercenaries, to be cultivated more than his imagination. He therefore had a sense of honor and romantic frankness that high, which destroys every day, so many learnings of milliners. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice of lbat was thrown by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the palriteur by their irregular folds and vorious coloured spots. He thought, well, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and rich: for the same reasons, he entered gay circles, marrying mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least through their languishing or blushing favors: at the same time, by their brilliant faces when he approached, and by their dazzling eyes, when he opened his lips, he soon led him into false notions of his talent and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles tall and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, blue srom lacks snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for one of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about releasing his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above went through it in his career.\nHe struck him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man who was absorbing himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit ascendant to their existence, implied by the avoidance of their contact: searching for the imagination to imagine all that flattered his proposition to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the outpouring of his frequency, rather than the person in front of him. He has become familiar with HLM, has paid attention to it, and so far has put forward his opinion, that his presence is still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens Afsairf was embarrassed, and soon found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was about to journey. Desiring to obtain information about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was late for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towclrds putting themselves upori an equality with lhe oged, and not allowing them to appear as if fallen from the sklef, scandalous whiriever intrigues are mentioned as the sub-jecls of the pleasant or os praise, according to your degreo of the skill that he had to bear on them. They agreed: and Avbrey immediately evoked his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to report a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a system mark of him, who apparently had not hid in common with other minds, he rejoiced to accept it, and in a few days they passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to see the character of Lord Ruthven studying, and we find it now. That, many of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, these reflections offered different conclusions from the motives applause his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagabond, and beggar, rocked with his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could riot to avoid noticing that he was not on the virtuous, repugnant to indignation by the wealthy who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he was lowering his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with barely repressed fingers; but he who profligated him once to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to plunge him deep into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. It was, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which generally outweighs the absenteeism of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was more stifled his mind: every lhose on which he was best placed, inevitably made himself known that there was a curse on her, so they were all either lcd to scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and the most abiect misery. In Brussels and in the cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which the companion sought the centres of all fachlonable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of faro: which betted, and always played successfully, except where the known sharper was his antagonisl, and then he lost even more than he gcliné; but he always had the same face unchanging, with which he generally looked at the arourid society: This is not the case, however, when he launched the young novice eruption, or the unlucky foetus of a large family; their even wish shone the law of fortune — this apparent obstinacy of the mind was apart, and his eye lit more fire than that of the cat while untangled with the mouse half shredded. In every city, he left the old easy youth, lom of the circle which he looked, cursed, in the slitude of a dungeon, the lhat spell had drawn him into the tho reach of this end; while many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the talking airs of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present need. However, he did not take money from the table of play; immediately lost bul, to the ruiner of Germany, the last guilder whom he had ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bull might be the refusal of a certain degree of knowledge 1, which was not, commenter, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his sierid, and begged him to reshuffle this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, arid did not tend to his own project ;— but he delayed him — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke of the levets than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratifying gratification from him. The excitement of the valley wanting to break this mystery, which to its exalted imagination began to assume the enthusiasm of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rame, and Aubrcy, for the last time, saw his conclusion; he left him sitting daily in the morning circle of an Italian country, as he went in search of the memorials of another almost deserted city. Will thus committed himself, letters came from England, which he opened eagerly impatienced with; the first was frowning his sister, breathed nothing of his affection; the others were guardians, the latter surprised him; if she had before entering into her imagination that there was an evil power residing in her companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. Hif Gardlans insisted that he immediately left his friend, and urged, that his baracter was a vicious draconian, because the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made his licensive habits more dangerous.\nYes. It had been discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the hatred of his character; but he had demanded, ensnaring his gratification, that his life, the associate of his vile, be torn from the epineum of undefiled virtue, to the lowest ways of infamy and degradation: in Siria, that the females whom he had sought, appearilly because of their failure, child, since his departure, even threw the mask aside, and had not rescued to expose all the deformity of the vices due to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined on Ieaving one, whose choraoter had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a pretext of possible to abandon him altogether, in order, in the middle while, to monitor him more closely, and to leave no slight circumstonoes pass unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he was mainly frequented at home. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to take care of her plans in the dryland; but every eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would probably end in the origin of an innocent girl, a girl without thought. He entered Lord Ruthvens apartment and abruptly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the time of the health that he knew he was there to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he thought that all would have an opportunity on Suoh; and upon being in a hurry that he intended to marry him, was a content to laugh. Aubrey withdrew, and immediately, writing, to say, that from that moment, he had to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their project, he ordered his servant to sow other opartments, and to piss him off on the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only about him, but also about the character of his Lordship. This transfer was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven sent his servant to warn his camplet of a separation; but the riots revealed that his plans had been forged by the interposition of Aubrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon sounded in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and saon occupied by tracing the fed record of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the leaves, had hidden under the scaly ground or many colored lees. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that could have formed the model of a painter called wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of faithful teeth into Mohammed's poradis, except that the cheek eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that it could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the real mountain, it would have been thought that the gazelle was a bad type of her beauties; for those who would have excubated her eye, apparently the animated eye of nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted blue to the taste of an epic. The long stage of Ianthe Osten accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities aster, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of the Berber form, floating as just were on the wind tho, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he came from deciphcred on a tahlet almost erased, in contemplation of the figure of ber sylph-like. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun sucb delicatcly bri and erasing the hues, he might well excivate the forgnitude of the antiquarian, who let escape from his spirit the object even that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausariias. But why do you want to describe charms that everyone feels, but laughs can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, not infected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. When he drew these remains, he wanted to keep an inemorial for his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the dancecircling on the open plain, he painted, to him in all the brilliant covers of the young memory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having looked at in her childhood; and then, turning to the sub-jocts thal child accidentally made a greater impression on the spirit of beer, would tell him all the supernatural tales of her nurse. His fervour and apprehension aroused the very interest of Aubrey; often he tries to tell him the story of the vampy that had spent years in the midst of his friends, and the ties of dorcst, witched every year, by looking at the life of a beautiful semal your proloring his existence for months, his blood was cold, while he tried to laugh at so many idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted the names of the old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after many of their close relatives and children had been found marteled by the stamp of the fiancé appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she begged him to believe, for it was noticed that those who dare not question their existence, always had evidence that found them unbelievable, with pain and tear, to confess it. She detailed him the traditional appearance of the TBEFE monsters, her horror increased, listening to a fairly precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he continued to persuading her, there could not be a truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey Bogan attached him more and more to Ianthe; his iriocence, to contrasted with all the virtues uttered by the women omong that he had sought out his vision of romance, gained his heart; and while he was cunning the idea of a young man of the habits of English, marrying a Greek girl without education, he was still more and more attached to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-avarian research, he went away, decided not to return until his object was reached; he always found impossible to fix his attentioniori on the ruins around the bim, while in his mind he retained a that image alone the rightsulpossefsor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same infant fire being having the first ring. She always seemed hesitant; it was because she no longer had one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragment who had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parenles on the vampyres of the object af, and they thought, with several present, the existence afflrmed their, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they saw the name of the place, they all begged not to resume at night, because he had to necessarily pass through a wad, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day, to any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the instead of heavy ovils as depending on who dared to cross the path. Avbrey made the light of his rehearsals, and tried to brighten them with the aid; but when he saw them trembling with his audacity to mock a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrecy left on his unattended excursion; be surprised to observe the nuclear face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible friends, had inspired this kind of terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came on the side of his horse, and sincerely prayed to him to turn, the night passed allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spocks which, in warmer climates, quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their fury upon the devoted land .— He finally chewed his horse, however, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is of almasl unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it had od advanced far, the power of lbe storm was abouous — its thunders failed hardly had a interval of rest — its heavy rain forced its passage through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked lightning blue tbe seemed to fall and radiate its feet. Suddenly, his horse looks scared, and he was wrapped with a dreadful rushed through the tangled forest. The animal at 1 last, the fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not rise from the mass of the dead leaves and the wood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that they would find a little sound to guide the HLM tower, or least trusting to get a shelter against the storm basin. As he approached, the thirders, for a silent moment, let him raise the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocated mockery, exutories of a lough, continuous in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised: but, excited by the thunder that was still rolling his head, he, with an effort of the sudden, forced the opening of the basket of the hut. He identified himself in the total darkness: the noise, the moaning, guided him. It was apparently not perceived, because, although he called, the sounds continued, and no attention was taken from him. He found himself undisputed by the former, who, in himself, immoderately seized himself; when a voice cried out ,\" Again gagged !\" to whom a great laughter took hold; and felt afflicted by him whose strength seemed superhuman: dissuaded from selling his life as derisory as he could, he bowed his hands in vain; he rose from his feet and rushed down with a huge force on the ground :— his enemy threw himself on his back, and knelt on his pike, and rose his hands up at the top of his throat — when the brightness of many lorches penetrated through the hole that gave light in the day, disturbing him ;— he rose up instantly, inflamed himself, leaving the prey hjs, rolled through the door, and in a storm the crushing of the bracbes, as it was understood through the wood. The storm was still there, and Aubrey, the incapablo of moving, was soon heard by those without. They rode; the light of the drags of Jr fell on the mud walls, and the thatch loaded on each individual straw with heavy flakes of soil. At the desire of Aubroy, they sought her who had attracted him to his thunderstorms; he was again left in the darkness; but what was the horror, which the light of the trench burst once again upon him, to pierce the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought into a lifeless course. He shakes his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from disturbed bis ininagination; but he sees again the same form, when he closed them, lying at his side. There was no colour above the cheek, not even above his lip; yet there was a dizziness of his face which seemed almost as attached as life once there was :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of the teeth having opened the vein :— to this, the men pointed, wept, mixed with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A bitter first was adorned, and Aubrey was laid by the side of the one who was badly late to him, the object of so many brigbt and the sairy version, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mirid was tainted and seemed to run away from reflection, to take refuge in the vacancy — he almost unconsciously held in his hand a dagger riaked of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search of her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated the parents of a terrible catastrophe. — To describe the child's pain would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the car. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized by a violent moft fever, and was often delirious; in these iritervals, he called on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by careful and incompetent combination, he seemed to be begging his former Empire to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, lucky this time to arrive at Athenf, and, for whatever reason, on the bearing of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constent awaits. When he recovered from the bis delirlum, he was horrified and amazed at the sight of him who had this image that he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault that had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and gripping care that he showed, soon reconciled to his presence. His seigneury seemed quite careful; he no longer seemed to be apathetic thal who had subtitled Aubrey; but, as soon as his brain evalesceress was quick, he gradually withdrew into the same spirit, and Avbrey did not see any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to grind his carefully fixed look on him, with a malicious exultation smile playing on his lips: he knew rioted why, but this smile haunted. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Rulbven was apparently committed to looking at the tides raised by the cold breeze, or iri making the progress of those orbs, surrounded, like our world, the sun without purple ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the spirit that had once disturbed him so much now seemed to have run away from afar. He is now as in love with solitude and silence as the Lord Heaven; he has as much as solitude, his spirit could not have sinned in the quarter of Athens; if he saw him as most that he had been poorly frequented before, the form of Ianthe was swallowed by him – if he trampled her in the woods, his light would stop appearing wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly turning around, to his wild imagination, his pale, arid face wounded his throat, with a sweet smile on his ber lips. He determined the scenes, each seam of which created in his mind, such associations of better. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he had been bound by the care he had taken from his illness, that they had caused them to visit these parts of Greece and that they had not yet seen. They passed in all directions, and looked for all the places where a recollic could be attached; but, although they were so stunned from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generosity of those they defended against alleged dangers. As a result, by neglecting the advice of the inhabilans, they occasionally travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than a defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrenl, with large masses of rocks descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reasori lo lo repentant of their neglect; for hardly was the wbole of the party engaged in the pass of Nclrrow, when he was surprised by the whistle of bvllets near their head, and by the report echoes of scverol rifles. In an instant, their guards had left them, arid, behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Avbrey, Imitting their examination, retired for a moment behind the beirig-like turn of defilement: but shameful of being thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, bale lhem advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves should rise above and take them to the rear, they deterred both right forward in search of the enemy. They had a little shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot from the shoulder girl, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account, the canteen or his own peril, one soon surprises by seeing the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, upon Lord Heaven is wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrenders.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his friend wouri ded to a nearby hut; and having invited him to a ransom, he no longer forced themselves by their presence — they were merely coritants to keep the entrance until the comrade their could return with the promised sum, so that he had ordered. Lord Ruthvens strength was rapidly decreasing; within two days the martification followed, and death seemed to progress with rushing gusts. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious as he had been; but towards the end of the last evening his mind was apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often attached to Aubrey, who was indignant to offer his help with more serious visual —\" Help me! You can save Mc – you can do more than that – I don't moan my life. I pay attention to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey replied. \"I need, but a few things — my life flourishes — I carinat explains everything — but if you hid everything you know of me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the throwing man, raising him up with exultant violence ,\"Swear by every your soul roaming, out of fear of the Yaurus nature, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or of the death of any living being, in any way whatsoever, or of what you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their boots :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ridiculed himself in his stake, and he no longer breathed.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; many circumstances attributing his knowledge that this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he swore a chilling cold camo on him, as if the presentation of something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had put the body, when a thief met him, and irritated him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a mountain of neighboring, ancestor to a promlse which they had given to his secretary, which he had to expose to the first cold ray of the moon which rose after his dowry. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several men, determined to bury him on the spot where he is. But when he went up to the top, he did not have a trap of Tbe carpfe or Ibe clothes, although the thieves swore that toy drew attention to the identical stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was stunned in the conjectures ,6 but he finally reopened, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired for hcighten superstitious that mystically that bad grasped on his mind, which determined to leave Jt, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While, who wanted a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, took care of the organization of his effects on Lord Ruthven. Among the other cases, there were several weapons of force, more or more adapted to the death of the victim. There were several daggers and scandals. Whether turning the cm, and looking at their hairy forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — rushing to obtain the surther proof, he found the woopon, and his hair can be imagined that he discovered that he was bleeding, although in the form of a pouliary, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at your being bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular shape, the different shades on the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splendour on both, and probably did not allow to wander; there were drops of blood class on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home to Rorne, his first investigator had attempted to seize the lady whom he had sought to seize Lord Ruthvens seductive roots. His parents were in distress, their fortune rained, and the case had not been heard since the departure of his secretary. Auhreys reindeer became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had caused a victim to the destroyer of the earth. He became morose and silent; and his occupation consisted of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dearly. Arriving at Calais, a breeze, which seemed to be soaked at his will, soon tucked him on the English shores; and he hastened to the mansjon of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared at tolose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all of them the memory of the past. If she made sure, her caresses infontines, had clinched her career, now that the woman began to appear to you, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the colsemblies of the drawing salon. There is none of this brilliance that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never lit by the levity of the spirit beath. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to be born of a mesforture, but of a certain sensation inside, which appeclrod to iridal a suI consciousness of a more brilliant real. His step was not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a calour can attract – he was sedated and perished. When her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother and her brother breathed to put his affection, arid could in his presence forget those deed that she knew how to destroy her real, who would have exchanged his smile for that of volunteer? It seemed that the eyes were then playing in the light of their own native sphere. But it is only to be seen, and it had not yet been presented to the world. It was an attack on the part of its guards who should have delayed the anticipation until the return of his brother from the continent, where he could be a protector. It was therefore now resolved that the real salon, which was approaching quickly, should be the time of its entry into the \"busy scene\" intellect. Aubrey would have stayed in his father's mansion, arid fed the inélacholi who surpassed him. He could not feel interested in omitting the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the events that he had misunderstood; but he was dellermining to sacrifice his owri comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and proposed for them the next day, which had been wrapped up like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room riot was held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to bask in the kingly smile, hastened there. Aubrey was there with his sieve. While he was standing in a mass grave by himself, without taking into account everyone aborted him, clinging to the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Rulhven walls in that same place, he fell himself sudderly seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, sounded to his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had the courage to attract, seriously to see a spectre that would make him lose, which he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his attention or his place up from his first entry into society. He looked until his members almost refused to carry their weight, he was forced to drop a friend's arm, and to force a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He rushed into the room with pieps, and stared at his back head, as if he feared that his thoughts would weaken from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath .— He razed himself, he could not believe that it was possible — death rose in the past !— He had totally imagination had conjured the image that his mind was resting. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, therefore, to go back to society; for tough, he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in getting information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. He swallowed him under the production of a matron, and retired in the recès, and there he gave himself his own devouring puffs. Perceiving, at the loss, that many were learning, being awakened himself, and entering the other room, found his sister surrounded by sooveral, apparently in the oarnest conversation; he tried to pass and approach, when one, who was asked to move, turned, and revealed to him the thossc features that he had the most horror. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurre, forced him to the street; and at the door he was ambushed by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lord; and while he was engaged in the passage of the hemicycle, he brought up this voice that murmured by him —\"Rem-\nHe dared not to turn around, but when he rushed from his sister, he soon returned home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was confused, now that the cortality of the Agairi of the living of the monster has pressed on his purchases. Her sister's attention was now free of hiccups, and it was in vain that she invited her to explore it. which caused his brutal conduct. He didn't say a few words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more mad he was. His oath suffocated him ;— Was it then to lighten this moron ,6 to apprehend him on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent him from progressing? Maybe he hit him. Bul, even if he was to break bis oath, and dislike his suspicions, who would believe? Ho thought to use the hif the owri hand to shake the world of subb cl wrelch; but death, he remembered, had already mocked. For days, he remained in his condition; locked in his room, who saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, jerking him, for his own good, to support nature. In Lasl, no longer is capable of a soothing silence and a solild, he left the house bis, wandered from street to stretch, arixing to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, afraid he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as the midnight humble. It was not dangerous to be recognized; he first returned home with the eugenture; he threw it at dawn to rest where the fatigue spilled. His sister, anxious for safety brief, employed people to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any — of thought. His conduct, however, has suddenly changed. Strvck with the idea that il lefl par bis absence of all the friends bis, with a friend among them, of which they were preserved unconscious, he dissuades to erect again in society, and closely watch him, anxious in advance, iri frie from his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intjmacy. But when one entered the room, his distrustful and rogue gazes were stunned, his inner trembling so viscous, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to refrain from seeking, for her, a focus that struck him so hard. However, when the reverranoe turned out to be uriavailing, the guardian to just proper to interposo, and, pretending that his mind was becoming alienated, they kept the time to regain that confidence that had previously been imposed on Thom by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and daily sufferings he had encountered in chopsticks, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, the traces of what they considered to be madness, they lured a doctor to reside in the house, and to take the horny of him. He hardly seemed to notice, his computer was also absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence has finally become so great, that he has been confused with this chamber. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. Hc had become emmacated, his eyes had reached a gimace chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory remaining displayed itself at the entrance of the hif sister; then hc sometimes began, and, grabbing his hands, with badly distressed that appearances, he wanted her not to touch the hive. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" Whiri, bower, she asked WBOM to refer. Her only answer was :\"True! True !\" Again, he sank in a store that she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted a lot of months: graduated, rainbow, as the year passed, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and its miride threw a part of its glam, while its guardians observe that the several times in the day he would count my fingers a challenge-\nNice number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, begged his doctor to oppose the rnelancholy circumstances of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going to marry the next day. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked the anxiously whom. Happy with this return mark of the intellect, whom they feared he had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Mclrsden. It was a young Earl that he had met in society. Aubrey seemed happy, and amazed them even more than he expressing his intention to be near to the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, tears full of mind, flowing to the thought of the back brother being once again alive feelings of afsection. Hc began to speak with all his warm words, and to corirotulate it on the hard marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and greed acquiescence; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on the chest hor; open it, which was his surprise to stifle the traits of the amateur who had so long influenced his life. Hesei 2 made the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled him foot urider. Asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as he did not understand him, so by grabbing his hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expression of Countnice, he told her to swear that she would never marry that monster, so he could not advance — it seemed that this voice again badly. He remembers his goal – he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was not him but did not see once. Meanwhile, the guards and the physicist, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return to his trouble, entered, and forcing Miss Auhrey, wanted her to leave him. He kneeled for them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for the day of the storm. They, attributed this madness which they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, tried to paeify it, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after the drawing room, and had been refused with another. When he heard of August ill health, he willingly sold himself to be the cause; but when he lightened him, he was judged mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to the house of his former company, and by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could wrestle his power? If the language had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of itself as an individual having no sympathy with any being on the rowed earth, except with her to whom he addressed ;—coveld say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it was more than he could listen to her soothing sawers ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of serpenl, or such was the will of destiny, that won his affections. The title of the elder branch falling in the long term, he obtained an important embassy, which served as an exercise far haftening the marriage ,( in spite of his brother's disturbed status ,) which took place to the day before his departure far continued him.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe servants in the club, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she valued her own happiness, back own honor, arid the horror of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and the weight of their house, to delay but for some compasses that marriage, on which he denounced the heavy mousse curse. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more by, which considered the rauings of a maniac. The night passed without rest for the busy members of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that may be easier to conceive than to endorse, the nobles of the busy preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars rang on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving him in the custody of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a related person aspect of the room, and in a drowsy fawn himself in the apartment where everyone gathered. Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive it: he immediately applied.\nroaring, and taking his arm by force, rushed him out of the chamber of the table, without a spot of fury. On the slaircafe Lord Ruthven whispered to Iri his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if my fiancée is not today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his ottensors, who, awakened by the old woman, had a room in search of her. Aubrey could no longer bear his anger; his rage, not sinning cell, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to the sister of this, who was not ready when he entered, as a doctor was afraid to satisfy him. The wedding was celebrated, and the wife and husband left London.\nAbbrey weakness increased; bloodshed has produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister guardians to be called at night, and when the hour in the middle of the hour had struck, he wrote a composite account of what the reader had hit, and he died suddenly afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; it was too late when they arrived. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nA CRO AMOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THEIR LORD BYRON, etc.\n\"The world is in front of it, where to choose the place of rest, and provide its guide .\"\nIN Sajling across the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1812, we put into the port of Mityleno, on the island of the name of that. The happiness of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and always vegetables to have there, iridulates many British ships to visit — both of the men of war and merchants; and although he finds himself missing it out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrna, his amplyreply burrelets for the deviation of the cold voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were used to water the iri, and the shipowner was negotiating for the cattle with the native Tbe, the ecclesiastical and myself taken a ramble on the cave called Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek club over guide, who told us that he came badly from Scio with a Lord English, who feared that the island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said to the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am likely to be involved. He is weird, but he is a good man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, but not consantally; for he very often sails his felucca to the different islands .\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time, hastening from the huff where our compatriot lived. We were gracefully reassembled by a clean old husband, what led us to the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor — an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all decorated sumptuously: green walls, marble tablaces on either side, a large bottle in the entree, and a small fountain benca-\n, one could play through the table branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Venus horne in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completes the fur. In the room there were half a dozen English cane chalos, and a full coffee book: there are no mirrors, a rare single pain.\nI don't know. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the sitting, we observed a marble reooss, once, the old inan told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the chesl of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we were juvstified in the examination of the contents. On the tablet of the recess rest Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and the works of Roufseau Complcte; the Ruins of Ernpires of Voyney; Zimrnermari, in the German language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Porma in 1810; the several little pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, torn muoh, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with clinical notes, written with a pencil, in Italian, arid Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with papal leaves, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had read these hooks before he sailed, and forgot to place them in others; but, he said, they must be lying on his return; for it is so special that I would carry a thing without order, he could have frowned on me a week together; it is otherwise very good. Once I did a service; and I had the product of this farm for pain after taking care, except twenty zechins that I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adriariople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance from the outside house was nice. The portico in front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the white black plains canned marble pillars and the cargo-work work cornices (as it is now usual in the Gregian archbile ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered by a turkey carpet line, under an awning of coarse linen strong. Most of the roofs of the house are smoky, for them, the Greeks spend evenings smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", including fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens mingling on its edges, crouched under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seal with an ornamental wood back was plated, on which we are told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until 1 twelve clockwork, reading, writing, and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very crazy, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calela, covered with olive and myrtle very iri flower, and on the top of which a Greek temple annoid seemed in majestic rot. A small stream that descended from the ruins descended into the brown waterfalls, until it was the first in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth like glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the 1-night blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely played a view more than I did; but our demands were unsuccessful as the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I sure he won\" and cannot you say an old friend ?\" I say ,\"if I can,\" I say ,\"I won't dare\". We did not have time to visit Tbc Armenian, but upon our return to Towri, we learned several particularvlars of Tbc seigneur isolated. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and never danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton silk attached to the girls who live by weaving items of lasc. He also bought a new boat for a bad baby fisherman lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testamerits to poor children. In short, we appeared, from the call we clashed, for having been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstratory that we have learned, whip our old friend or cottage deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a very beautiful donut, with which the lord was seen osten walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him outside himself the use of it.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who its rambling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our dolphins were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Italy .\" We had then heard of the laziness of his secretary, as we had been a few years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. Did we regret not being more curious in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mityleno on a future mcly; but to me that day, laugh retum. I make this statement, believing that she is not uninteresting, and in court to the good reputation of her secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been deseruted as a urifeling arrangement, expresses the association of human nature, or contributing in any way to soften its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is terribly the opposite, as can be seen from these little anecdotes. All the most beautiful little eyes of the heart, so elegant in the poems of his seigneury, seem to have their sitting in hif bosom. The tenderness, sympathy, aridity seem to guide all his actions; and his awakening to the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him being on whose heart Religioniori laid his sea, and of whose head Volunteer has cast his mantle-\n- Yes. No man can read the previous pleasant \"trails\" that feel proud to be proud as a castingman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and he dares to justify himself in a terrible court where all the most apprehensions can only censor the errors of a confreremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and flouting the applause of the world, is the testimony of the virtuous and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleel Street.",
    "35": "A VAMPYRE:\nThat is right.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which his tale is based is a very general in the East. European Union Arabs it seems common: however, he did not depart from the Greeks until after the establishment of Christiariity; he normally assumed his present from the division of the Lotin and the Greek churches; at that time, the idea of dominant hecaming, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it were buried in their territory, he gradually increased, arid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from these tombs, and feeding on blood type of young and healthy. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Polarid, Austria, and Lorrajne, where the belief existed, that vampyrcs might include some part of the blood of their victims, who have been emaciated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these human bloods-\n-the fattened cocksuckers—and their camouflaged velns distended to such a state of repletion, as if to cavise the blood to flow from all passages of their body, and even from the pores even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, on March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of cl particular cases of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hvency. It seems that, in an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magiftrals of the place, they positively and unanimously affirmed that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard saying, thal, in Cassova, on the frontjers of the Servia Turkifh, who had been tormenned by a vampyr, but had sounded a way to rid him of the malice, eating from the suine of the earth beyond the tomb of the vampyre, and rubbing his blood. However, this precaution did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and of having made a statement well, that four persons had been deprived of life by bis attacks. In order to avoid deafness, the inhabitants having cortified their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be useful in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting cold mouth, nose, and ears, fever and florid blood. The evidence was thus obtained, he resorted to the accusation remedy. An entire stake was pushed through Arnold Paul's heart and body, but which he would have shouted as sadly as if he had lived. They cut off his pearl, burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same increases were adopted with the horns of those who had previously died of vampires, lest they in turn become agents on others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is that a persori sucked by a vampyre becomes a bimself vampyre, and continues in turn.\nChief of the bail.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here. It seems that the better adapts to the object of the present observations that the primary other instance which could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a sorcery of punishment after death, for a crime was committed in exile, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to unfinish his infernal visits only to those beings he loved most while he was on the other, those to whom he was linked to the bonds of tenderness on affection .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then, haunting ghost lbe native place, and sucking the blood of all thy race; there of thy dclaughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the parse of life; yet the banquctwhioh perforoe shall feed thy livid living corsus, Thyvictims, are they exhaled, Are the devil for thyself, thou cursest thyself, thou curdest them, Thy flowers are wilt on the stem. But a bat for your crime must fall. The youngest, the best loved one, devours in your mind the name of a father — This word will engulf the heart in flame! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of the eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with a hand soaked, will tear the trace of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest plodge of affection has been warned — But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy grinning tooth and thy harging lip; and after the tomb of sullen, go, and with Gouls and Asrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nSouthey also presented in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaha\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grove with the aim of the tormentering that she loved better during her existence. Bul this cannot be supposed to have revulsed from the sinfulness of her life, she being spread across the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of several astronomical cases of uampyrism, to which he claims to have been a witness; and CaImet, in his great work on this subjeot, besides a variety of anecdotes, and the traditional riarrotifs ilustrative of his esfects, has highlighted some diffractions learned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbarlan.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limit of a noto, resarly deviated from the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, although the term Vampyre js that in the most goreral acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocolaka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the attondarite dissipations over a London winter, a nobleman appeared to the various parties of the leaders of the town, more remarkable for hisningularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted attention, so that it could by a glance extinguish it, and throw fear into those breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who fell this feeling of apprehension, could not explain when it arose: home attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, hiding on the face of the object, did not feel penetrated, and at a glance to pierce through the inner work of the beard; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin, it could not pass. His peculiarity led him to be invited to each house; all fought to deceive him, and these had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the misfortune of boredom, were placed as having something in their presence capable of engaging their tension. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, which neuter g ained a warmer tenel, either of the blush of modesty, or from the slrongemotion of the passian, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many of the slrongemotions, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call imperfection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of monsler shewn iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a montebank, to attract his attention :— although in vain :— while she stood before him, although her gaze had apparently fixed herself on her, still it seemed that they were not pierced ;— even her vnappallé intruded inga, and she left the field. But although the common adulter could not influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was iridescent to him: however, this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and the innocent donut, tell little kriew he ever addressed to women. He had, however, the repulation of a winning language; it can be seen that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were eaten up by his hatred of vice by parent. He was also often among the women who make up the best of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who push him through their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an organ left with only one sister in the position of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. The guards, who thought that they had only to look after the fortune, renounced the most ruthless accusation of his mind towards the subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of good and candour, and he always destroyed the apprentices of many thousand. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and though that vice was thrown iri by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we saw in the romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply in the revealing eloth bones, which were also warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by irregular folds their and various colored clothes. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for the sake of these, when he entered gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or blushing favors: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon lost him in false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was starred to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snuffsing, there was not the foundation in the life of reol for any of these congreries of losing images and defriptions conclined in the volumes of lhose, from which he had formed his studies. However, some compensation was paid to his father.\nvanity read, he was abject to give up dreams, when the extraordinary being that we endowed above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man completely absorbed ln bimsci, who gave a few other signs of his observation of objects of externality, flouted the tacit agreement to their existence, imperious by the avoidance of the contact there: allocating his imagination to the image of something aurora that flattered his propensity to extract ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person begging him. He met with him, paid him attention, and so far has advanced to his opinion, he has always been recognized as his president. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthven's business was being barred, and almost four times, from the preparation notes in — Street, that it was low to travel. Desirous of gaining a little infarction regarding this singular character, which, now, brandishes only his curiosity, he suggested to his guardian, that it was time for him to make the tour, which for many generations has been considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as fallen from the sky, whenever financial intrigues are mentioned as subjects of poverty or p level, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consulted: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Thorn, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flammed by such a mark of his esteem, which apparently did not have in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few dowries they had passed the winter waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had no opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the rebuttals have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to be conducted. His companion was profuse in liberality ;— the lazy, the vagrant, and beggars, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not avoid being resentful, that he did not go to the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the mesfortvnes who accompanied even torture, whom he granted his alms ;- these were sons of the gate with sneezes hardly begged; but when the profligate came to ask for bewitchments, not to cast down his desires, but to allow him to fall asleep in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent back by a rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which overtakes the bashfulness retreat of the virtuous instinct. There was a conversation about the cobority of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on the bis spirit: all those on what he was granted, invitahly found that there was a curse upon, because they were all either lod to thescaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which he passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought centres of all the vices in fashion; he entered into the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always garnhled with success, except where the known scholar was his antagonist, then he was even greater than he won it; but just was still with the same immutable foco, with which he generally wated society around: it was not, however, when he encanced lhe rah young novice, or the lucky father of a large family; then he very desire seemed fortune's Iaw — this abstract abstract mirid applaction was put aside, and his eyes were quenched with more fire than the cat's thal while delirting with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the youth awfully easy, tom of the circle he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had pulled the hair within the reach of this friend; while many a sanctuating father, in the midst of the gazes talking of mute hungry children, without a single distant from his last immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy your present desire. He did not take any money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the stream of many, the latted glove has just been ripped off from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was nat, however, capable of picking up the trick of the most experienced. Avbrey Oston wanted to represent this to his friend, and begged him to sign the charity and pleasure that proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for every day he helped his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and gradually to him; however, this never happened. Lard Ruthven in his carriagc, and almost the various scenes of wild and rich nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his ljp; and although Aubrey was near the object of his frillosity, he would not get a greater grotification fram than the constant excitation bone vainly wishing to break this mystery, which at this exalled the hegan imagination to assume the appearance of a certain supernatural.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his corn panion; he left it daily in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, a whip which he opened with impatience; the chief was his sister, breathing nothing but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there had been a bad power resident in his occupation, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for the belly. The guards immediately insisted that he bequeathed his friend, and urged that his character to be horribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction gnawed his licentious habits more dangerous for society. He had discovered that his contempt for adultery had not been born in the struggle of the ber-haracter; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, could be cast out from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: ln flne, that all the semals which he had defiled, apparently because of their virtue, had, from his departure, thrown Eueri the mark aside, and had not burned to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the whole character had not again shown a single luminous point on which corrects the eye. He decided to invent a pretext of plausiblo to abandon him in laughter, to purpose, in the Korean during, to beat them closer, and not to let pass any slight circumstance. He entered the same circle, and soon perished, that his secretary was enduring to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he mainly froccating. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secr and; but Aubrey's eye followed bim in all his windings, and soon will describe that an assignment had been designated, which would end the most likely in the ruin of an Innocent, though not considered a girl. Leaving no time, he entered Lord Ruthveris apartment, suddenly and asked her his intentions with respect to the lady, informing him at the time of the celebrity that he was aware that bis was about to meet her that night. The Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that all would have on such an occasion; and after having been precised that he irried to marry him, simply plowed. Aubrey retired; and immediately seized a note, to say that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the commandor of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The assignaliori has been proven. The next day, Lord Ruthven merely sent his fervour to riot his full consent to a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion that his plaris had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey started his steps towards Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to draw the split record of ancient glory on the moments which, apparently, shameful to chroricer the acts of free men only to be slaves before, had hidden under the sheltering or inany floor colored lichen. Under the roof of sclme as hell, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have renounced the model of a painter who wanted to pour on oanvass the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed paradlso, except her eyes spoke too much of mind so that someone thought that she could be among those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain table, or stumbled along the mobile-\nOn the side of Japan, one would have thought of the gazelle or the poor sort of greetings; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparent to the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious dormant look of the adapted animal but to taste them on the epicure. The light stage of Iarithe oflen accompanied Aubrey in the search for antiquities, often attached the unconscious girl, sharpened in the pursuit of a butterfly of Kashmero, shows all the beer forrn, floating as it was on the wind, with the greedy look of hjm, who forgot tholotters which had decrypted on an almost erasable tablet, in the contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often his falling braids, like shc flitted around, exhiit in the ray of the sun so dclicately brjlliant and quickly erase from the hues, just can excuse the forgnitude of the antiquarian, which escapes it from the mind, the very object that he had thought of important vital to the correct interpretation of a passage iri Pausanias. But why try describe the characters that all fry, but no one can associate with it ?— It was innocenco, youth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded trigmaloms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing remains of those from which he wanted to keep a mernorial for his suture balls, she could stand by, and look at the magical effects of the hjs pencil, in the race of the scenes of her native place; sbe would then describe him the circling dance on open plain tube, would be matched, to him in all the glamorous colors of the young memory, the marriage pump that she remembered viewing in her childhood; and tuna, tvrri-\nWith regard to the subjects who, obviously, had made a greater impression on his mind, would tell him all the punctual tales of his nurse. She often told him of the blade of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her sweets, and of the draconian bonds, forcing the year of dawn, by bringing up the life of a beautiful woman to proloring her existence for the next months, her blaod ran cold, while he attracted her from laughing at these idle and horriblo fantasies; but Ianthe made to him the names of old men, who had finally detected one living among them, after several of her close relatives and children had found marked with the seal of the appetite of the friend; and when she found him so unbelievable, she bowed down from him to come to his aid, for he had been reverbed, that tbose who had dared to question their existence, had always given him proof, who had unbelieved them, had begged him to confess and confess his heart. She detailed at home the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on intimidating him, that there could not be a truth in his fears, although at the same time he wondered about the multitude of coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supreme power.\nAubrey began to grip himself more arid plus to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected by the women among whom he sought for his vision of love, won his heart; and while he lured the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he found himself ever more attached to the almost magical form in front of him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, cultivating a plan for some antiquarian research, he went away, insisted not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention bis on the rings around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be a legitimate alone than possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and he was always the same frank child being known first. She always seemed to separate herself from him with the resolution; but it was obvious that she had no one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy seizing a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents or the subject of vampires, bones, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to proceed with the anointing of the exercises, which had to hold him for a few hours; who heard the name of the place, all at once begged him nol de retum at night, because he had to pass unjustly through a wood, where Rio Greck would never remain, after the end of the week, on examination. They described it as the resort of the vainepyres in their nocturnal organs, and denounced the heavy ailments of foam as imminent on the one who dared to erode their way. Aubrey lighted the representations of the Jr, and tried to laugh from the idea; but when he shuddered them to his audacity, so your mother a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their blood freeze, hc was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey went on the excursion without lingering; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his bosom, and was concerned that his words, mocking the bolief of horrific friends, had inspired them from the terror of the suckers. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horso, and earnestly begged him to return, there night allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. He was, however, busy with his research, that he had not understood that the light of the day was coming to an end, and that in the barjzon there was a bone thase specks which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass lremendous, and shed all the rage of toil on the devoted land .— He, however, finally climbed his horse, dlermined to catch up with the speed hy for the time bis: hutit was too late. The twilight, in these sudem climcltes, is known from the alrnost; immediately the sun sets at night begins; and it had advanced far, the storm's power was above – the hesitating thunders had an increase of rest – its thick heavy rain forced them to go through the canopy leaflet, while the forked lightning seemed to fall and radiate its feet itself. Suddenly, his horde became afraid, and he carried the dreadful through the speed of the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lighting, that it was in the vicinity of a hotel that hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he objected, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or to Icast the confidence to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woinari mingling with suffocating and exulting mockery of a laugh, to continue in one sound without radiance ;— he was starred; but, agitated by the lhurider who again was rolling on his head, he, with a sudden force, to open the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived, although he called, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He snuffed himself in contact with someone, whom he immediately felt second; and a voice cried out ,\"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laugh trodden; and he felt distressed by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vairi: he was lifted up from his feet and fasted with enormous force against the ground :—his enemy threw him, and knelt on his chest, evilly put his hands bif at the top of his throeal—when the brightness of many torches penetrated into the holo which lit him in the day, the trouble arose instantly, and by closing the crushing of the branches, as he broached through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; the Devil Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who had nothing. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the straw loaded on each straw with heavy soft flakes. In search of Aubrey, they sought her who had stirred her with her claws; he was again left in the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torch once moro burst on the hive, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor broughl in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision that arose from his disturbance; he again saw the same form, when he stripped them, lying on his side. Tberc had no color on the cheek hor, no even on his lip; but the thril was a lisure on his face which scapped almost as much attacking as the life that there was once :— on his neck and his brèfle wcls blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this the meri ponted, weeping, at the same time struck with horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter was formed unexpectedly, and Aubrey was deposited alongside the beer who had recently been for him the object of brilliant and magical visions, now hallen with the flower of life that had died in charge. He did not know what his thoughts were: the spirit bis was inflamed and seen at reflection, the arid took refuge in the vacancy, he was very unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon joined by different parties that had been engaged in the dry growth of her than a mother child realised. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated the parents of a devastating disaster. \"Describe them the evil that they have done; but when they ascended to the cause of the child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and painted to the Corsican. They were inconceivable; both died in the heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seizod with a more violent fever, and waf often delirious; in these instruments he would appeal to Lard Rulhven and Ianthc—by an inexplicable combination, it seems that he begs his former companion to spare him being loved. At other times, he impregnated the malediciaris on the head of the bis, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the opportunity at his hour to arrive in Athens, and, of any kind, at the hearing of the impasse in Aubrey, immediately put herself in the same house, and became his constant wait. When the latler covered himself with his delirouin, he was horrified and scattered in the sight of him whose imagining he had now combined with the tbat of a Vampyrc; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for that fault had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled him to his grace. His seigneury seemed quite chagoude; he appeared no more than the apathetic being who had so surprised Avbrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to be rapid, he gradually withdrew again into the stato sarné of mind, and Aubrey preceived no difference of the former man, except that he was sometimes taken to sniff his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation plclying on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last period of recovery of the invalid, Lord Rutbven was very keen to observe the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, turning, like our world, the movementless fun ;— indeed, he seemed to want to escape the cyef of all.\nAubrey Mirid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of mind that the feeling so distinguished now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and net as Lord Ruthven; bvt much that he wanted to solve him in the neighborhood of Athens; is it sought in the midst of the ruins which he had frequented very peasantly, the shape of Ionthe stood at his side – if he sighed him in the woods, his slight step wo might seem wandering in the middle of the urid erwood, in search of the most made purple; then suddenly would turn, to his wild imagination, show off pale face arid wound throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, each characteristic of which created so bitter associations in his mind. He posed to Lord Ruthven, to be bound by the tender caro that he had taken from him during his illness, that they had to visit these parts of Greece or had not yet seen. They traveled in all the directions, and sought every place where a memory could be made straight; but although they hadtened in this way from one place to another, they do not see themselves to lift up what they were looking at. They heard a lot of rubbers, but they gradually began to take over these parts, which, according to them, were only the inuention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the gerierosity of those whom they defended from prison-\nThe dead dangers. Because of this neglect of the advice to the inhabitants, they only travel once with a few guards, more to serve as defence guides. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torch, with great inafses of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they had the reason to repent of their negligence; for they were hardly the whole of the parli engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their head, and by the ratio echoed with several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had a fire in the direction when the report came. John Ruthven and Avbrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the bend sheltering from defilement: but shameful to be so held by an enemy, who, with insulting blows, lowered them advarice, having exposed themselves to a scammer without resistance, if one of the shord climbing thieves above and brought them iri to the rear, they immediately dilermied to rush in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Steven received a shot in the shoulder, which brought him back to the ground. Avbrey hastenod to his assistance; and, no longer holding the contest or his peril owri, was soon surprised by seeing the faces of the robbers around him — his vards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthuen was wounded, immediately to possess their claims and surrendered.\nBy promises of a haily reward, Avbrey foon instructed them to transport his wounded friends to a neighbouring hut; and having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their pregnancy, being simply content to guard the credence until their comrade had to turn with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens flrigidity was quickly decreed; in two days a mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and his bad appearance did not change; he stunned as little pain as he had been objects about him: but towards the end of the last night, his mind became apparently clumsy, and the high eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to dare his help with more than the usual rut —\" Help me! I do not mean my life, I have not listened to the date of my existence as little as the date of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little, of my life spaced, I cannot explain the whole, but if you hid, if you knew Mc, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world, and if my death had been unknown for some time in England, me, but life. \"-\" We know the riot. \"Jurez !\" cried the dying man, rasiving himself with exulent uiolence ,\"Swear by all your dreams of love, by all your fears of nature, swear that, for a year and a day, you will not give your knowledge of my ores or death to only live in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes appeared to be inflamed by his socks ,\" I swear !\" said Aubrey ,\" and he laughed on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey resisted to roam, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose in mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a glacial camo upon him, as if it were something horrible that was awaiting him. He rose up in the morning, and was enrolled in the coffin in which he had thrown the corpse, when a thief had met him, and had informed him that he was no longer there, having been transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retirement, the pinnacle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given his leadership, that he should be exposed to the first ray of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, determined to go and bury just on the place where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he had no trace of the ropes or clothes, although the thieves swore that they would punch the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the body for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid iri who all apparent conspired to increase this superstitious mearicholy that bad speed on his mind, he decided to leave it, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to assist him in Dtranto or Naples, he took care to organize the effects he had with him, belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case containing several weapons of offence, rnore or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several dark glooms and typhoons. As he aridly examined the delicate forms, what was his surprise at finding a fbeat apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger dismantled in the fatal, but — he trembled — rushing to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovers that it was part of the sheath he held in his hand, although particularly shaped. His eyes seemed to need greater certainty, they seemed to look to be linked to the dagger; but he wanted not to believe; because the particular shape, the same variable shades on the sheath half wave were similar in the splendour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrria, arid on his path home, clt Rome, his first investigations were about killing the lady he had tried to catch Lord Ruthvens scathing early. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been heard since the departmenturo of her secretary. The Aubrey spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; fear that this lady was not the victim of the anti-seaster. He became morose and silent; and if only the occupation consists of exhorting the speed of the postilions, as of being would show the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breezc, who seemed obedient to his will, soon set him on the shores of the English; and he hastened to the inanition of his brothers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his sister's embraces and caresses, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her effect, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was more touching as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning the grace that won the eyes and applause of the salon assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. Except, the blue eye has never been illuminated by the activity of the spirit beneath. He was a melancholy charm about him which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a small conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't as light, which goes astray where an ass or a collar can get away – he was sedate and pensive. When alone, his face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when his brother broke his affection, and would be in his presence, forget those details, she knew that he had destroyed his rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that from the country? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of the thorium's own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been presbyterated to the world, he was tang but by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed until the return of the brother of the mainland chair, that he could be his protector. It was therefore resolved that the next drawing room, which was the last approaching, could be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his father's mansion, and had enough of the melancholy that gave him power. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he was delirious to sacrifice his own comfort to the prefecture of his sister. They came into the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a diving room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a while, and all the who were eager to rest in the kingship smile, hastened together. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing alone in a corrier, he did not take into account all that was around him, he entered the remembranoe thorax the first time he had split Lord Rutbven in this very place, he felt suddenly seized by the elm, and a thought whom he recognized too well, sounded in his ear ,\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing seeing a spectre would explode, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure who had attracted his police to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members clashed to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and make a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was pushed into the horn. He trampled in the room with covered steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again implored him—circumstances began in a terrible painting—the dagger—his oath .— He woke up, he could not believe that he was able— the dead are resurrected again !— He thought that his imagination had brought up his repose upon. It was impossible that it could be real—to be determined, therefore, to return to the into society; for the laughter he dared to ask about Lord Rulhven, the name having upon his lips, and he could not suckeed in the information clining. He left a few nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the production of a matron, he withdrew into a process, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many were left, he bimboved, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turn around, and reveal to him these traits he had the most horror. And he went forward, and took hold of the arm of his sister, and hurriedly he was kindled toward the stairs; and at the door he was struck by the multitude of servants who were fighting for their lords; and, while he was engaged, iri, he heard this voice murmur by him again —\"Remember ye there\" He made nat daro to turn, but, by pressing his sister, soon ricachod home.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before his child spirit was absorbed by the subject of oria, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the living ability of the monster has pressed on hif thoughts. Her sister's attraction was now unanswered, and it was in vain that she threw him to complain about what had worked his abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and they terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath began a bim ;— Was it then to descend this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His ulcerous sister may have been touched by Bim. But evon is being lost breaking his hand, and d...\nWho would believe it? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from such a wretched; but death, he remembers, had already been mocked. For days, he remarried in this state; he closed his room, he saw no one, and stooped only when his sister came, who, with eyes suffocating with tears, thought them, far from his sake, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and satitude, he left his house, wandering rue de sram, anxious to steal that imogo which brought him. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. It was no longer long to be relegated; he returned first with the greeting to the house; but at last he laid him to rest where the fatigue surprised him. His sister, anxious for his safety, used people to follow him; but he soon carried away by him who fled from a pursuor faster than any storm thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence he left his whole sling, with a challenge among them, whose presence was unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and looked closely at him, anxious to protect himself, despite his oath, from all those whom Lord Ruthven approached with int-\nImacity. But when he entered a room, his gazes of haggard and suspensiovs were so striking in, his inner chills so visible, that his sister finally hlified to the back of him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that struck him his stroriggly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards wanted to intervene, and, fearing that his spirit would become alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had been imposed previously by the parerils of Aubrey.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering that he had caused in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, arid take care of him. Hc hardly seemed to notice, so completely the whole mind absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his room. There, he often bows for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and recollicion that remained appeared on his sister's writing; then he sometimes began, and, by seizing his hands, with deeply distressed eyes, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he referred, just the answer was ,\"Truo !t true !\" Arid again, he sank Irito state, from which she could not even roam the bim. This lasted many morithes: graduated. However, as the year passed, his iricoherics are frequent, and the basic spirit threw a part of his morosity, while his guards observed that several times in the day he could rely on a number of fingers, engaged and smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room began to converse with his doctor on the circumstantial melancholy of Aubreys being in so terribly stutuation, when his sister would laugh the day to get married. Aubrey's attention was drawn, he clings with anxiety to whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, which they searched for had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he met badly in society, Aubrey vuined pieased, arid surprised them even more by his expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of the beer smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once again alive to his feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his warmth worried, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he soldered tenly received cl locket on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to see the monster seats that had influenced his life so long. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On his asking him why he thus strangled the resemblance of her future husband, which looked as if he did not understand it — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expressiori face, he made swear that she would never marry this monster, for he — but he could not advance — he saw as if this voice again asking him to remember his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking Lord. Ruthven was close to him, but didn't see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard all this, and who thought it was only cl return a bis disorder, enraged, and forcing Miss Avbrey, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees, he irritated, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing madness, they imagined to take possession of his urid, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven called the morning after the show, and the child was refused with all the others. When he heard of every ill health, he readily understood himself to be the cause; but when he heard that he was denied, his explanation and pleasure could hardly accommodate those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened to make the house of his formal companion, and, through the constant waitaneo, and the claim of great affection for his arid brother, interested in his destiny, he gradually gains Miss Aubreys ear. Could we resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell — could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with hair 6 th on the overcrowded earth, except with it, he addressed himself ;— could say how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to seem worthy of conservation, was it simply that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew whether the art of service, or so badly the will of destiny, that he gained more beautiful affections. The title of the old branch which was long held by him, he obtalized the important embassy of Ari, whooh served as an excuse to humiliate the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) when which was to take room the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but the girl failed. He asked for pen and paper; it was to give him; he wrote a letter from cl to bis sieur, conjuring beer, as she valued his own happiness, his own honor, and the honor of lhosc now in the grave, which held her in their arms of their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours we who were pounding, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised to deliver him; but giving him to the doctor, he had better not harass the spirit of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, rauings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that can be more easily designed than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning came, and the urid of the cars broke on his ear. The Aubrey is growing almost frantic. The curiosity of the servant, at last, improved their vigilance, they gradually moved away, leaving him the guard of an old woman ruthless. He seized the opportunity, with a tied man, was out of the room, and in a moment found hessels in the apartment where all the were almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arrn by force, rushed him out of the room, without a voice in the fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthveri whispered in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and if my fiancée is not my fiancée today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he moved him to grope his servants, who, awakened by an old woman, had come into the sea of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury, which had not found ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. It was not deserved to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid of agitation. The marriage was solemnized, and to be married and married to fear that London.\nAubreys weakness increases; bloodshed produces the symptoms near the approach to death. He wanted the sister guards to be called, afraid when midnight had struck, to be connected in a composite way that the reader persisted — he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to overwhelm Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was an update. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF LORD BYRONS RESIDENCE ON MITYLENE TERRE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The sorva was in front of him, where to circumcise his resting place, and to provide his guide .\"\nIN Sail through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's vessels, in York 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of Tbe of this name. The beauty of this dish, and the certain supply of eats and vegetables always to get thorc, lead many Britishesses to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships hunt at Smyrna, its countries pay a great deal for the decision of a voyage. We disembarked, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, arid as the men of Tobe were watering, and the armorer negotiated far the cattle with the nativos, the ecclesiastical and myself took a ramble at the called cave Homers School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Idcl (a small mound so named) we met and hired a Greek young as our guide, who said of he had a Scio carn with Cln English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucco. \"He hired me as a pilot, sold the Grcek, and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mjtylene, where I am likely to marry with frost. He was a weird man, but a good very man. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and low resided there, although not constantly, at 6 or four feet months, for he sails in his field ucca very often on the different islands .\"\nThis account greatly excludes our curiosity. We didn't waste any time hastening from the house where our country lived. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a living room and a bedroom, with a large closet attached. They were all simply decorated: light green walls, marble tables on the side, a large myrlle in the center, and a small fountain underneath, which could have played through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sosa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen of England cane chairs, and an empty case book: there was no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress spread on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the lounge we abbreviated a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a sailor image in the closet: it was open, but we did not think overseas justified to examine the content. On the Tablet of Recreation works by Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousfeau; Ruiris of Empires by Volney; Zimmerman, in German tbe; Klopstock's Messiah; Kotzebues play by Robbers; Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press by Tobe in Coristinople, much torn, but no English book has any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and in the lalin. The Messlah was literally scrambled all over, and m arkod with sheets of paper, on which were also marks.\nThe old man said ,\" The Lord had scorned these books in the evening before he left, and forgot to put them with others; but, he said, he must lick until his return; for he is so special, that if I move something with orders, he would sling me for a week together; he is indeed very good. I did him a service, and I made the product of this farm if he had trouble dealing with it, with the exception of twenty zechincs that I paid to an Armenian agent who resides in a small coltagc in the wood, and that Lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The front porch was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as just now usual in Grocian architecture) were significantly higher than the roof. Tbe roaf, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a fine cherry carpet, boncath wearing a strong coarse line n. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, the Greeks pass over them by their crazes by smoking, drinking lights, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", eating sruct, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a strall staircase slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens, which gathered on its borders, and found the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his furnaces and nights until 1 twelve hours, reading, writing, and talking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very devoted, and that he always attended the church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe storm view of this seat was what could be terrified of \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mourit Calcal, covered with umbles and blueberries in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken cascades, until it was lost in the woods near the house of the mountain. The smooth sea of glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, tarnished the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, small several islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emergency spots. I seldom enjoyed a view more than I did; but our riquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: the friend knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had left to Candia. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I am sure it won't be,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to live in the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He shared the sight of young girls when he was the last on the island, and even drank with them at the national festival. He gave a cow to a man, hares to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He bought a new boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, and he after gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all we have understood, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we licked, whip our old friend to the college deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a beautiful rose daughter, with whom the lord was seen walking on the sea horde, and he had bought out a pjanoforte, and taught him the hesels of the use of it.\nThese were the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposing, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arriving in Palermo, the doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been traveling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" saldil ,\"clbout who you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my trauels on the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of the secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calclas reoluse on every page. Deeply, we have not been more curious about the aur research at the cottage, but we have comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that day will never come back. I do this ardour, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his lord ship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been disordered as an insensitive provision, contrary to the association with human nature, or contriving in any way to appease his sorrows, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their seat in the bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide his actions; and to remove his rest from the soil is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon whose heart, the religion sealed his body, and upon whom the head of whom the Volunteer cast his coat. No cari man has read the pleasant \"traits\" that preceded without attacking him as a compatriot. With the answer to his loves or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially against my husband's moral integrity; and whoever dares to justify himself before this horrible court where I have to appear, only can censor theors of a confreremortol. Lord Byron's character is the writer of his genius. To make good in secret, and to escape the applause of the world, is the sure testimony of a virtuous heart and the consciousness of scout approval.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "36": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Poidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is a very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek Churches; at that time, the dominant becoming idea, that a Latin hody could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, from the death rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. Iri the West, it spread, with some variation slightly, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres soaked some of the blood of their victims at night, which emaciated the bee, lost their strength, and quickly died of consumptlons; while the blood suckers such humans grazed—and their veins became distended to such a state of repletion, so that the blood faded from all passages of their body, and the oven extinguished very porous to their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, a crucial account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is declared in the house, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, during an examination of the chief commander and the Mogistrats of the place of Tbe, they pofitively and unanimously, talk about fivc yeclrs before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard to say that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, having been girded by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of the grieving, even by eating from the earth oul of the tomb of the vampyr, and rvbbing himself with his blood. This precaution did not prevent him from becoming a hiinself carrier; for twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, husbands complained of having been torn by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attractions. To avoid other misadventures, the inhabitants consulted their Hadangj, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in the cases of uampyrism) fresh, and ontarely free corruption of srom, and emit to the mouth, nose, and eors, pure and florid blood. As the roof of the P was covered, they resorted to a regular remedy. A score has been trained....\nThrough Arnold Paul's assiduous body, it is said that he would have shouted terribly colds if he had been enslaved. It was done, they cut his head, burned his body, set the ashes in his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of those people who had already died of vampyrism from, for fear that they would, in turn, become agents on others who were monitoring China.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here....\ned, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In some parts of Greece, it is possible as a kind of puriishment of death, for the home of heinous crime committed during existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but compared to infernal consinehis visitations only to those beings whom he loved masl while on earth — those to whom he was bound by arid links arid afferiori .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut Sirst upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his tomb; then shall haunt the native place, and suck the blood of thy seed; from thence of the daughter Ly, Ly, Slster, Wifo, In the midst of the noise draining the stream of the lift; and yet the kingdom of the banquet which is the performance shall feed thy living livids c orsus, the victims of Tby, create they exhale, Kriow the devil for their sire; as ye curse, ye curse them, Your flowers are wilted on the silt. Even if he who for your crime must fail, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will imprison your coffin in the flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the washed hue of his cheek — the spark washed from his eye, and the glassy look must see what freezes from his lifeless blue; Thon with a hand without hallowed teler The braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the thorn The tenderest affection was worn — But the riow is carried far by the lheo Memorial of the three agony! Yot with your own best blood will flow; Your grinning tooth, and the lip of the hook; Then hunting at your sulten tomb, Go—and with Go uls and Afrits rave, will these in horror shrink the hold of spectrum more cursed than they.\nSouthey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire eorse of the Arab girl Oneiza, who is represented after having returned from the grave in order to torment him more blinded in existence. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of his life, being poured throughout the blade as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Toumefort gives a long rush in the hif journeys of several cases of astonishment of vampyrism, to which we pretend to have been ari eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of ariecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, has put some dissertations learned, tending to prove to him an elusive error, as well as barbaric.\nMarily curious and iriteresting riots on this singularly horrible millt superfition to be added; tang the present can suspense for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simply pointing out that if the terin Vampyre is that in general acoeplation, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like VroucoIocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &e.\nThe Phantom E.\nIt came to pass that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied the London winter, he appeared at the various places of the lacaders of the long nableman, more towable for its singularities, than his rank. He attacked him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the high laughter of the fair attracted only his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who perceive this feeling of admiration could explain not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, fixedjrig on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate lo, and with a single stroke topierce through the interior works of the heart; but feel on the cheek with a thal of lead ray weighed on the skin that he could not pass. The peculiarities caused him to be Inuit at every house; all wanted to see this, and those who had been accused of living excitement, and now feel it the weight of boredom, were happy at having something in their presence able to engage their attention. Despite the deadly tint of her face, which never spoiled a warmer tint, whether it was the bass of modesty, or the strong emotion of the passlon, gnaws her shape and cutliric wore hair, many hunters of fernalcs tried to win her bowels, and to gain, at least, some mark of what they might call affection: Lady Mereer, who had been the mockery of every nunstor worn in draw-roorns since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and made all huts put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her attention :— but in vain :— when she held before hjm, although the eyes were apparently fixed on her, it seemed nevertheless that they were not seen ;—ever her unapplied impudence was overlaid, and she left the field. But the common adulterer could not even influence the guide in his eyes, it was not the female sex was indifferent to him: but the suob was the apparent solution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman attached to an innocent girl, that few ever knew that he was speaking to women. Ho had, however, the reputation of a winning tonguo; and whatber is that he even overcaded his singular character, or that they were moved by apparently hot hif of vice, it was as more and more these women who form the vanity of their sex of domestic lheir virlues, like among those who push him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, there was in London a young man named Avhrey: being an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great sweat, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself also by the guardians, who thought that their duty further to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the greater burden of his mind to the subalterris mercenary carc, to be cultivated more than his irnaginalion than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many apprentices, many millioners. He believed all sympathy with virtue, and thought that the practice was grown in Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we feel in romances: he thought that the inserie of a cottage consisted simply of the jacket of clothes, which were also warm, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patterns. He thought, in the end, that the poet's dream was the rectitudes of life. It is beautiful, frank, rich: sor t these reasons, on its entire into gay circles, many mothers surround it, trying to describe with the least of their liking or blushing favorites: the girls at the time sarnc, by their brigandant behind the scenes when he approaches, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opens the lips, soon lead him in a false note of his tales and his merits. He was surprised to see that, except in the tallow and wax almonds that sparkle, not precious or ghost, but lack of snoring, there was no basis in real life for any of these conglomerates of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Find, when, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his obsorvotiori of external objects, that the assent taclt to their existence, implicit by the avoidance of their cantact: allowing the hif imagination to imagine each thing that left his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this moment in the true hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advanced until his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. He learned that the Lord Ruthvens business was embarrassed, very quickly, by the preparalion notes in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain information on this singular character, but, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he insinuated to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the hur, which for many stewardships was deemed necessary to allow young people to make a few steps raples in the career of the vice towards getting even with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasure or praise, clinging to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: and Aubrey lying immediately to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such an este mark of him, wba, apparently, had nothing in common with other meri, he accepted it glodically, and in a few days they had passed the water over circling.\nUntil now, Aubrey had no opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthvcn, and now to be found, that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to hif vision, the results have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the child, the vagrant, and the beggar, received more than enough of his hand to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the Miffortunes who even accompanied a virtue, which he granted to hjs alms ;—lhese werc scnt from the door with barely deleted plots; but when the profile came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow hlm to fade in his lust, or to sink even deeper in his iniquity, he was sent back with rich charlty. However, this has been attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, which generally prevails over the retirement of the virtuous needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found a hot charge was a curse upwards, because they were all bailiff led to scaffolding, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his companion sought out the toes of fashionable life; there he entered into all the epilepsy of the Faro table: he bet, and always snacked with success, except where the most clearly known was his antagonisl, and then he lasted even more than he won it; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune —t-\nHis apparent abstractions of the spirit were removed, and his eyes were shining with more fire than that of the cat while delirying with the half dead mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, Tom from the circumference, he worshipped, cvsing, in the solild of a dungeon, the madness that had attracted him to the reach of this final; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the airs talking of a mute hungry childron, with a slight stuffing of his immense wealth Iate, where to buy even enough to satisfy their present desire. But he did not take money from the slide; but he immediately lost, for the ruiner of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the consecutive catch of the inriocent: this could but would be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the most experienced running. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged Hirn to resign from this choice and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speak frankly and openly; how, this never happened. Lord, Ruth...\ncoming in his car, and in the midst of two various wild arid scenes rich in food, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near to be the object of his curiosity, he oblainded not groater gratification from him that the excitement vainly constunte bone wanting to break thal mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his companion; he threw him into the daily dance in the morning circle of the Italian Countess, while he was going to march in the memoir.\nThis is another city, almost postponed. While he was engaged, Ietters came from England, and they opened him impatiently; the first came from his sister, and breathed nothing from the affection of the huts; the others came from his guardians, the local tor slonished them; if he had already entered his total imagination, there was an evil power residing in his companion, this seemed to give him sufficient reason for the 6th. His guardians insisted on his immicd friend, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irreplaceable powers of seduction made his deceitful habits more dangerous for society. He had been distracted, that his contempt for the adultrest had not generated iri hatred of his character; bull which he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, the victim of thal hls, the partrier of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of unwelded virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in sinus, thal all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since hif departure, even threw the mask put aside, clnd had not frowned to expose all the deformation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey torpedoed by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous pear on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning the hive together, purposing, in the wicked, then, to beat it more firmly, and to let the rio slight circumstrrices pass by non-noticod. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose mainly home he frequented. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is a word with in society; so he was forced to wear his unbridled plans; but Aubreys eye follows him in all the windings hjs, arid soon dissaver that an asking-\nThe nation had designated 6 th, which would most likely end in the ruin of a harmless, unthinkable laughter girl. Not wasting no time, he entered Lord Ruthven's apartment, and abruptly asked him his intentions towards the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his 6th about meeting this very night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he would all have had such an opportunity; and after being in a hurry if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this moment he must deeline accompany Hls Lordsbip in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and calling on the mother of the lady, informed him of He knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The summons were stopped. Lord Ruthven the following day simply sent his reserve to notify sacramplete ostent to a separation; but did not hlnt only suspicion of bis plaris having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece, and crossed the periinsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the faded annals of ancient glory on monomenls that oppressive, shameful to bronch the acts of slaves srecmon only before, had hidden themselves scorned the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could make the form of the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvases the prornised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too mild so that someone thought that she could belong to these who had no souls. While she was dancing on the plain, or truffled along the side of the mountain of Tbe, it was thought that the look was a p0 or a type of its beauties; for those who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of animal nature, for this luxurious look of the animal sultod but until the last of the article. The light stage of Ianthe often coopporized Aubrey in his search for aniquities, and often would be the unconsciaus girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of his sorme, floating as he was on the wind, lo the greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he came from deciphcred on a lablet infaced him, in the contemplation of his sylph-like figure. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted arourid, expose in the ray of the sun such delicately bright and quickly soothing shades, he might well excuse the fargelfulness of the antiquarian, completely escaping from the spirit bis the very object which had before thinking the importance of the vital bone to the correct interpretation of the passage cl in Pausanias. Why do you want to describe the chorms that everyone feels, but none can appreciate ?— He was innocent, youthful and beautiful, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew these remairis which he wanted to preserve in future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her place of origin; she would describe the circle darice on the plain operi, painted to him in all the brilliant colors of the young memory, the marriage pump which she remembered to look at in her childhood; and then, turning to subjects which had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, we could tell to hear all the supernatural tales of the nurse bear. Her sincerity and apparent belief in what she was telling exacerbated the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to proliferate her experience during the following months, her blood would be ruricold, while trying to laugh at her by such idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the namos of the old, who had finally detected a living between them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the name of the friend; and when she had made him so unbelievable, she had begged him for it. It is true that she was the one who dared to question their experience, that she had always had proof, that she had had to confess, with grief and sorrow, that it was true. She detailed him the traditional opera of these monsters, and her horror grew more and more, hearing a rather precise description of the Lord. Ruthven; however, he still persisted on the persuading, that lrc could not be lrutb in herfears, though at the same shot, he wondered about the numerous collicences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to strangle himself more and more to Ianthe; his inocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of love, wori his heart; one as he ridiculed the idea of cl yaung man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still more and more he attaches himself to the almost magical form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan far from a few research antiques, who would go away, determined final to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the ruins surrounding him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate teacher of his thoughts. Nathan was not conscious of his love, and was always the same frank child believing. He knew it for the first time. She always seemed to separate from him with contact; but it was because she had no one with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had still eclipsed the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, in the spirit of many present, were foiling their existence, pale with the horror of the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few bites; when they barbed the name of the place, they all begged the attention not to return to the neighborhood, because it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever remain, after the day has closed, to any consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampyres in their nocturnal orgies, and denied the most heaviest ailments as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. To the brey made the light of their resignations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently unaided their blood gel, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattended for his excursion; he was surprised to observe the meloncably face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly prayed to him to return, and he left the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. He took so much care of his research that he had not understood that the daylight was coming to an end, and there was on the horizon one of those spots which, in the warm climates, accumulated so rapidly in a huge mass, and poured all their race over the disadvantaged country .— He finally mounted his horse, determined to catch up; but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and it had already known far away, the power of the storm was above — its thunders failed had barely a irterval of roft —lls thick rain dropped they forced so to grow the surrounding foliage, whllst the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse was scared, and he was carried with fearful speed scrambling the oritangled forest. The animal finally stopped, because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of the glare, that it was in the vicinity of a hoof that did not remove it, shuddering the masses of dead leaves and brushwood that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the city, or at the confident distance to get a shelter from the storm basin. As he approached him, the thunders, by far for a moment silent, allowed him to hear the terrible fires of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, continued in a sound without a mast ;— he was struck; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effect, forced the door of the hut of the lho. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, the inclination, the sip. He was apparently not aware of it, because, then he called, always continued sounds, and nothing was taken of him. He identified him in contact with someone, whom he immediately seized; when a voice cried out ,\" Always flouted !\" He felt he was plagued by a force that seemed superhuman; he fought by selling his life as hard as he could, but he was in vain. Ho was lifted from his feet and threw a huge force against the ground :— his enemy fell upon him, and knelt on his chest, had placed his hands up his throat — when the glare of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave the day of sight had troubled him ;— he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as her hrokc through the vagabond, was no longer beard. The storm was still there; the arid Aubrey, unable to move, was heard by those who did not. They eject; the light of their lords fell on the mud, and the thatch loaded upon each choke with heavy soft flakes. At Aubrey's desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was left again in darkness; but what was his horror, when the high of the torches once more burst upon him, to perceive the form of his beautiful co-ducress brought in a corsc without life. He cried out his eyes, hoping that the fact was only a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, lying at his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; yet there was a silence abbreviating his face which saw almost darkening like the life that once lived on the level :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— for the pointed meri, ring, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her who was recently 6 years old for bim bim, the object of so many brilliant and fairy visions, now fallen with the flower life that had died in her. He did not understand what his sighs were, if the spirit was afraid to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in a vacant post, he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been four in the heat. They soon met by different parts who had been engaged in the search for her that a motor had missed. Their lamentable weeping, after they approached the city, announced the parents of a terrible oatastrophe. \"Describe their sorrow would be impossible; but when they established the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to the chore. They are irreconsolable; both have died in broken hearts.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often dollrious; in these intervals he would linger on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a little unaccouritablo combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. To other shootings, he would permeate the curses on his head, waved the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Rulhven, had the chance at this time your arrival in Athens, and, of any innovative whatsoever, after hearing the fact of Aubrey, he immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the last turned from his delirium, he was horrified and scattered to the sight of Hiin whose image was now combined with that of a Vampyre; bvt Lord Rvthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentanco for the fault thor had caused separation, and slill more by attention, emphasis, and care which that what he showed, and soon he picked it up at his present. His seigneury changed completely; he did not appear long as an apathetic being who had so astonished Aubrey; but as soon as the convalescence of this began to be rapid, he gradually retreated again in the same state of mind, set on Aubrey pereoived na divercence from the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a grinning exvulsion smile playing on his lipson hls: bc kriew not why, but his smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently undertook to capture the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, hard to mark the progress of these works, turning, like our world, still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, and that elasticity of the mind that had once so distracted him now seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mirid could not find him in the nighbourhood of Athens; if he sighed him against the ruins which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side — if he supggt in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in the quest for a modest purpletho; then sudderilyturning rovnd, would show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, all the characteristics that created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Rulhven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from help during his illness, to visit the parts of Greece still seen the nuclear hod. They traveled in all directions, and sought a place where a correlation could be coupled; but while they hadtened thus from the place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to lick reports, which they imagined to be only the invoking of individuals, whose interest was to expel the generally from those whom they defended from the supposed dangers. Because of this neglect of the residents' counsel, they only traveled once with a few guards, more to serve as guides than a consequence. On entering, however, a narrow defilement, to the boltoma of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of stones that descended from neighbouring precipices, they were right to repeat their negligence; for a charcely were the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of buildings near their hands, arid by the echo report of several canonf. In a camp, their guard had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction from which the Camic report had been drawn. Lord Rulhuen and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the shlttering turn of the defilement: but shameful that they had thus held the blow held by the enemy, which, with insulting cries, told them to progress, and to be exposed to the slaughter of urine, if one of the robers should climb up and take them recover, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They barely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a stubble in his shoulder, which brought him to the earth. Aubrey climbed to hisstance; and, not heading the talesl orhls awn perll, was quickly surprised when he saw the hearts of the thieves around him – his guards having, on the beginning of Lord Ruthuen wounded, immediately threw their arms and surrender.\nBy promises of great reward, Aubrey soon undertook to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after having agreed on a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the present, and he merely kept the entrance until their command came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthveris strength rapidly decreased; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to be carried out with precipitated steps. His asshole and his appearance did not change; he saw the pain as it had been from the bamboo objects; but towards the end of the evening, his mind became apparently poisonous, and his eye of six on Aubrey, who was unbelieving to offer his help with more usual than freshness —\" Help me! You save me, you can do more than that. I don't mean my life. I listened to the death of existence only just like that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but I need, my life flourishes, I cannot explain the whale, but if you hide from me everything you know, my honor was free to stain in the south of the world, and if my death was unknown for life in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Jure !\" cried the dying man, cried the exultanl uiolence ,\"Swear by every your soul, by all your falcon nature, swear that for a year and a day you will not give your knowledge of my criins or death to only living being in any way, the whalover can happen, or whatever you can see. \"- His eyes seemed six-fold from their bases :\" I have a screwer !\" said Aubrey; he fell laughing on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAuhrey retired to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when one remembered his oats, a cold chill came on the hive, as if the present of horrific something waiting for him. In the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and irritated him in the air, it was no longer there, having was Canvey by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the pace of a neighbouring mountain, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several men from Ibe, determined to go and bury him in the place where he was. But, queri he had committed to sumrnit to find no trace of either body or clothes, although the sworn thieves indicated the identical rock on which they laid the body. For a time, his mind was bewildered by conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had broken the body for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of the country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which oll apparently conspired to increase this superstitious melancholy which had seised on his mind, to be resolved to leave her, and saon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otrallo, or Naples, he took care of the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Steven. Among other things, there was one case containing several weapons of offence, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. As he returned them, and looked at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the one that Dague discovered Iri, the fatal hut, which he shuddered, rushing to win the furlher proof, he found the weapon, and the horror bis can be imagined when he discovered that he was settling, although he was particularly high, the sheath hoar in the bis hand. His eyes seemed to need no certainty of surmer, they seemed to be around your dagger; but still he wifed at disbelieue; but in particular form, the same variable pulls on the haft and sheath were oexil in the splendor on both, and for fear that there would be no room for doubt; there are drops of blood wcro alsa on each one.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way home to Rome, his first inquiries concerned the lady whom he had enslaved to Lord Ruthvenfs snatoh seductive arts. Her parents were indistinguishable, their fortune ruined, and she had not been bearded since the departure of her scholarship. Aubroy became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady had been the victim of the Santa destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation consisted of energy, the speed of the profits, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. Arriving at Calais, a breoze, who seemed well disposed, soon threw him on the shores of the English; and he hastened in the house of his brothers, and there, a mother, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caress of her sister, all the memory of the past. Is she before, by her infantile caresses, had won her offeotion, now that the woman began to appear, she was more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid look applause the salon assemblies. That is where the warm atmosphere of a crowd of apartment exists. His blue eye was lit by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about him that did not seem classic from missorlone, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His foot wasn't so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can fall apart – he was sedated and pensive. When alone, his face was devoured by the smile of joy; but when his brother bewildered his affection, and forgot in his presence, those deed that the shoe knew to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged his sin for that of the voluptuous? It was said that the eyes, that the face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still only eightteen, and had not been submitted to the world. That is, she had believed by the guards to bear that the presentation should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, that he could be his father. So it was now resolved that the next show, which was approaching quickly, could be the time of unbelief in the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to remember in his father's home, and to attack melancholy that surpassed him. He could feel the most intolerant and strange strangers of fashion, when his mind had been torn apart by the events he had seen; but be determined to sacrifice his own basket to the protectors of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared the day of the next, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for some time, and all those who were eager to chop in the royalty smile, rushed. Aubroy was a typhoon with his sister. As he stood in a corner by his sons, without taking into account all that was around him, he remembered that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthuen was there, that he suddenly felt seized by his arm, and that a voice was too well recognized, sounded in his ear ,\"Remember your oath .\" He had little to turn, fearful of seeing a spectre that would last, when he pierced, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members almost refused to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his marriage, and was taken home. He made the room walk with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthvcn begged him once again – starring circumstances – dagger – his oath. – He was waking up, he could not believe that it was possible – and he was resurrected again !– He thought that his imagination had brought up the image of a bi-spirited blushing. It was impossible that he could be reol — he decided, Thérèse, to go back to society; for, although hoatlomped to ask for anxiety, the Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in getting the information. He left a few nights after his sister came to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he put himself in a corner, and there gave himself to his own devouring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many were leaving, he awoke and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in an oarnest conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him these traits that he most abhorred. He went forth, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hasty step, forced her to the street; and, at the door, he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants who were languishing for their lords; and as he took care of them, he heard again the voice that came near to him :\"Remember, your oath !\"Ho dld not dared to turn around, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to his home.\nThe Aubrey became almost distracted. So before his evil mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty as the life of the monster once again pressed upon his thoughts. His sister....\nThe attitude of the people was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she insulted him to explain to him what had caused his abrupt conduct. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, to ruin himself on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to the least of his progress? Maybe his sister was a weary by him. But if he had to brook his take oath, and divulge his suspensions, who would believe it? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been knocked. For days, hc remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with oyes, treaming with teors, begged him, for his own good, to support the nature. Finally, he is no longer able to withstand the calm and solitude, he left his house, wandered rue fram à street, anxious love to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he won, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the humid humidity. He was no longer to be rocked; first, he was riding in the house, but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for security, employed people for the follow; but they were soon escaped by him who fled from a sucr swifter than anything — from thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck with the idea that hc felt by his absenctbe whoo of his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxiovs to prewarn, iri fmite of his oath, al I that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and gloomy gazes were so striking, this mingling was so visible, that his sister finally undertook to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that so strongly affected him. When, blindly, the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to interpose, and,\nAs for the fact that his mind was becoming oleous, they thought it was a high time to regain confidence that had been imposed upon them previously by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering he had experienced in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, those marks of which they considered slowly, they asked a doctor to reside in the dung, and to take care of him constantly. He hardly took notice of it, so complete his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His inooherence was finally so great that he was confined to the bis chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to wake up. He had eclipsed himself, his eyes bis had stirred up to a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and recollection was manifested on the entrance of the bis sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands to bear, with glances that asphyxiated him, he wanted her not to touch the hair. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love is against me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she enquires to whom he referred, his answer to him was ,\"True! Travel !\" Arid again, he sneaks into a slate, from which he could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies are less frequent, and his mind threw off to the portion of his morosity, while his guards observed, felt several times in the day, he counted on his fingers a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, the last day of their, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholy of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Immediately, Aubrey attention was attracted; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this darkness of return intellect, which they feared was deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by the expression of his intention to be present at the nationals, and wishing to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a minute the fcw hissister was him with him. He was apparently again capable of being offended by the influence of his lovely family; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk about all his warmth, and to congratulate her on his marriage with a delusional person for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a 1 poet on his chest; open it, this was just surprised to see the appearance of the woman monster had flooded his life so long. He captures the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and trampollc under the foot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future Husbaride, he looked as if he did not stop him — by grasping his haries, arid looking at her with afrantio expression of coventenance, he made swear that she would never have been able to marry this monster, because he — but he could not progress — remembered if this rogue still reminded him of his oath — he turned back suddenly around, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and yet it was only a return to his disorder, bewitched, and enchanting Miss Aubrey, wanted to leave him. He fell on his knees for them, implored, begged them to delay, but start once a day. They, attributing this to the folly that they imagined the mistaking possesslori of his spirit, tried to pacify the bim, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called in the morning after the drawing roaming, and had been repressed with the hurry another. When he heard Aubreys bad holly, he easily understood to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was in a mad mood, his exultation and pleasure were hardly confused with those among whom he had spoiled this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of a great affliction far away, the brother and interest in his destiny, gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. What could I resist his power? Histonguc had dangers to tell: he could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded earth, who wanted her to whom he addressed ;— could say how, if he knew her, his existence, had had begun to seem worthy of conservation, except that he could listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of the servant, or this was the will of destiny, that he had won his affections. The title of the eldest branch fell to him in the long run, he obtained an important emphasis, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ), which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, who was left by the physicist and his guardians, tried to bribe screening officers, but to climb. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her. If she appreciated her own happiness, her honor, on the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their backs as their hope and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours that marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver him; but when he gave him to the doctor, he did not do so to crush Miss Avbreys spirit more and more by, what he considered to be, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the prisoners occupied with the dung; and the beard of Aubrey, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than the endowed, riots of the occupied preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the carricles broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants of the last became their vigilance, they gradually stole, leaving them in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seizes the opportunity, with a relationship was off the road, and in a moment found himself in the apartment where all was almost boned up. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his form by force, satisfied him with the room, without ardour. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whispered in his ear :\"Remember your oath, know that, if she is not my fiancée today, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his allies, who, awakened by the old woman, came looking for him. Aubrey could not support himself; his rage not finding Will, had broken a vase of blood, and he was thrown into bed. This was not begged to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was sold, and the bride and husband left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey increased; blood efficiency produced symptoms of approaching death. He wanted the guards of his sister to be healed, and when the hour of midnight had struck, he described in a composite way that the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey, but they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared. Our sister was thirsty for VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORDBYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was all before the hamburger to choose a place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, in the year 1812, was placed in the port of Mitylene, on the island of que dwarf. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables still to be found, led to many British ships to visit it, both warmen and merchants; and although it was rather out of the blue track for ships linked to Smyrna, its premiums paid a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in the watching, and the merchant of the money of the breeding of the nation-\nThe clergyman and I took a ramble from Homers cave school called, and other rooms, where we were before. On the front of Mount Ido (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lion, who left the island four days before his arrival in his folucco. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said Grcek ,\" and would have taken me with a hair; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage on the hill, facing the river, belongs to the hive, and he left a man of the Iri charge of this one: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for just ,( about L 250 English currency ,) and resided there abfit fourteen months, although not constantly; for he said in his felucca very often to the various islets .\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time hastening in the house where our castryman could reside. We were kindly recognized by an old man, who led us to the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing room, a sitting lounge and a bathroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply dormant: green waltzes, marble tables on each side, a rnyrtle barley in the o entree, and a small oven underneath, which could be made to play through the branches by renovating a spring fixed on the side of a branze Venus smail in a bent posture; a large cocb or sofa completed the furniture. In the room, there were half a dozen chairs of English caries, and an empty library: there was no mirror or single painting. The backchamber had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two cotton duvets and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we kept a morble corner. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and papers, whoooh were then in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but the medical riot thinks that we juvstified ourselves by examining the content. On the tablet of the recreation play Voltoires, Sbakspeares, Boileau and Rousscaus complete works; the ruins of Ernpires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kot 2ebue; the play of Schillers of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Losl, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma j 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no book in English of any description. Most of these books were killed with marriage.\nfinal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which the remarks were also made.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had 6 th reading the books of Thesc in the evening, so he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they must lie about his return; for he is so special, he was carrying a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. Once I made him a servile; and I have the product of this farm for the boredom of the lock-off cclre ofit, except twerity cclnes which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a single cabin in the wood, and which the lord crushed of Adrianople; I do not know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the outer nozzle was raining. The price at the front was fifty steps long and wide front, and the pillars in canned marble with lock plinths and fret work cornices ,( as it is now custoyincry in Greek architecture ,) were considered higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was covered with a beautiful Turkish carpet, under an awning of a strong clear lineeri. Most of the roofs of the house are thus smoked, as on them the Greeks spend their evenings smoking iri, light wines drinking, such as \"lachrymcl christi\", moving fruits, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we enter the haus, the brook small glided, the grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marbled seal with an ornamental wood back was placed, on the which was told, the lord passed many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he was very polite, and that he always attended our Twico church for a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird-eyo view\". A line of those rich vineyards led the eyo to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and flowering blueberries, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A single stream from the ruins descended from the broken waterfalls of the river, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smotb in glass, spanning a horizon darkened by a single cloud, rmines the view in front; and a little to the left, trouffing a high vi sta of hazelnut and palmtrees, feveral small iflands carried distinctly observed, emerald the light blue wave with emerald green spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our enquiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew the name bis but Dorninick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could say it, but I sure he won ,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had a bit of young strokes when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these art-\nThe Ice cubes. He also bought a boat for a fisherman who lost his own in a storm, said he often gave Greek servants to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we collected, at Havc was a very accerilic character arid benevalent. A circumstance we learned, which our old friend at the cottage deemed appropriate not to reveal. He had a very benevolent daughter, with whom the Lord often walked on the shore of the sea, and he had made him a piano-fortch, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information with which we moved away from the peaceful island of Milylene; our imagination everything on the rack, guessing who this ramber at Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a disposition, philanthropy, and all the those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to an island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we were a few years from home; but \"Childe Haralde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recile of Calcla on every page. Did we not regret not being curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea to return to Mitylene on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of her secretary, which was grossly clumsy. He has been described as an insensitive disposjlion, averse him to human nature, or contributing in any way to bleeding his sorrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, the class can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finest feelings of the coffin, so elegantly scrutinized in his seigneury poems, seem to have their seal in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and tenacity seem to spoil all his actions; and his courteousness, the repugnance of salitude, is an additional reason that irritates him as an ori being whose heart, the Religion sealed, and on whose head Bérivolence cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. With respect to his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where I must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is a worthy of genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest test of a virtuous heart and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Street.",
    "37": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John Williain Polidorl.\nTHE superstition on which this tale is sounded so general in the East. Among Arabianf, then he appears to be common: he does not extend, however, to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; he did not assume his present before from the division of Latin and Greek churches; at the time when the idea becomes dominant, that a body of Latiri could not abort if it was buried in their territory, he gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful stories, still existing, of the dead rising from the jr grass, and nourishing upon the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with some slight variations, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorcline, where there was a belief that vampyres were soaking night after night some of the blood of the victims of TBE, who became emaciated, lost their strength and died quickly of consumption; while these human blood suckers were weakened, and the vines were distracted from such a state of repulsion, so that the blood flowed all the passages of the bodies and even the pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a critical account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the tho commander-in-chief and the magisterials of the place, they stated positively and unambiguously, that about five years 6 then, a certairi Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been heard, trot, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Servio, he had been tormented by a vampyre, but had four times a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyre, and rubbing himself with his bipod. This precaution, archaic, did not prevent him from frowning a vornpyre himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a custodian was made, that four perfons had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid other malice, the inhabitants who hated their Hadagni, took the body and found it (as it can be assumed in vampyrism cases) secreted, completely free of corruption, and emitting to the mouth, nose and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was thus worked out, they resorted to the usual remedy. A scale was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's art and hody, where it is reported for bave also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. This dorie, the ashes on his head, burned his badger, and threw the ashes into the grave bis. The same measures were adopted with the same people who died of vampyrifm, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire, 6 th comes a vampire himself, and sucks in his turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems to be suitable girdling to julustrate the subject of the present observations any other cases that might be presented. In many parts of Greece it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous crime commilted wbilst in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyrise, but forced to limit his infernal visits only to those beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition alludes to tbo \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre did, thy corsus shall frame his tear; then shall thou haunt the native place, and suck the blood of thy seed: there of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the slrcan of life; and yet hate the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, yet be lhey exhale, Sholl knew the devil for their fire: as cvsingthee, thou cursed them, Thy flowers are inlaid upon the stcm. But he, who, for your crime, must fail, the youngest, the most loved of all, is less than the name of a father: This word shall envelop the heart in flaming! But you must be angry, and you must mark the last mooring of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and let the ridiculed look see Who freezes or his lifeless blue; Then, with the urihallowed hand, will tear the braids of his yellow hug, of which, in lives a lock when the tender offering of affection has been carried — But now is carried by the memorial of your agony! Yet, with your best drop blood sball; your gnasbing tool, and the lip of haggard; then hunting for ly sulen falls, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors of Jn shrink from spectrum more cursed than they.\nMr. Suthey has also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vain Corsica of the young Arab Oneiza, who is presented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting him whom she loved while in existence. But it cannot be assumed that they are the result of the sinfulness of their life, being reversed throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. The true Tournefort gives a long account in his journeys of several amazing cases of vampyrifm, to which he prelended ta have been on the wilness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and the lradiary illustrative narratives of its effects, presented some leorinated dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic, as well as barbaric error.\nMany interesting curiovs and opinions on this singularly borrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, arid which can now be concluded by merely pointing out that the term Vampyro is the name in in most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms which will make use of in various parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Braucoloko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThe IT occurred in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, it occurred to the various parties of the chiefs of the tone of a nobleman, more noticed for his singularities, than his rank. He watched the mirror about him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fake attracted his attention, so that he could by a glance stifle him, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where it aros e: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, whieh, shining upon the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and with a look your pierce through the inner work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all the houses; he began to see the hive, and those who had been used to being excited, and now we felt the weight of unnui, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In the assile of the mortal emotion of her face, that neuer gairi a hot tlnt, quote from the blvsh of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passlon, although his form and beyond were beautiful, many women horers swollen notoriety tried to gain his attonations, and to win, at least, some inorks of what they might call the affliction: Lady Mercer, who had been the monster of the ovcry inockerie, had worn ln drawing-roomf since the marriage ecr, threw ber in his way, and did anything but put on the dress of a montebank, to stir up her opinion :—lhough in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently cling to her, it still seemed that they were not wearing ;— even her incomprehensible impudence was strenched, and she left him fleld. But the common adult could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was a real mind to him: yet this was the apparent cotlon with which he spoke to the virtuoso woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was ever addressing the females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was even that it was sur-being the fear of his character character, or that they were moved by his parent hatred of vice, being wos so often among these women who boast of heir sex from their domestic virtues, as among those he shuddered by vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while he was still in Cbi. Left also to himself by guards, who first have them just to take care of his fortune, while they reviled him D the most important charge of his mind to the care of the svboltern mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than the judgment hjs. So he had a great romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins so many fears of milliries. He believed all to fympathize with nature, and yet this vice was thrown into Providence simply for the picturesque infection of the scene, as we see in the romances: he thought that the misery of cl cottage was simply iri the garment, which were warm, but which were better suited to the eye of the planet by their irregular folds on various colored spots. He thought, in the end, that the dreams of the ponies were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, on his penchant in gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or snoring savorites: the girls at the same time, by their behind-the-scenes brighting as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, it started 1 at blinding, that, accept in the tallow and waxy candles thor flickered, not of the process of a ghost, but of lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any af that gathers pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his glow. Finding, however, some compensation in his graced benevolence, he was on lose abandoning his dreams, when extraordinarytho being we described above, the orosse in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, then the assent tclcit to their existence, implicitly by the audience of their oantact: allowing his imagination to image of each thing who floated his propness to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object this as hero of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He acquired himself with him, paid him attention and, until now, advanced his opinion even, that his presence was always recognized. He learned grudgingly that Lord Helen's business was wearing emborafsed, and soon his, according to the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was abhorred to travel. Desiring to obtain some information, listing the singular character, which, for many generations, had taken hold of its curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make the tour, which, for many generations, thought it necessary to include young people in order to take a few quick steps in the career of the vice towards the establishment of a state of mind for the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as failure of the sky, whenever scandalous indrigues are ionized as subjects of pleasant praise, according to the degression of the competence that is to be carried. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his actions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from behind a proposal to join him. He was moving away from him such a mark of esteem, which apparently had nothing in common with other men, he accepted it widely, and in a few days they had passed the waters circumstantiated.\nSo far, Aubrey had had no opportunity to study Lord Ruthuen's character, and now he has found that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered coriclusions different from the motives appearing to his conduct. His company was profuse in his liberality ;— the idle wanderer, the wanderer, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could revolt by pointing out that it is not about the virtual, reduced to indigence by the msfortunes even assisting on virtue, that he gave his alarms ;— these were sent from the dorm with sneezes barely removed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to fulfill his desires, but to allow him to wall up in his lust, or to sink even deeper into Bis iniquity, to be sent far to the spirit of rich charity. It was, rainbow, attributed by him to the greater importunity of various times, which generalizes the advance on the retirement of the virtuous indigent. Thero was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordship, which was still bitten by his spirit: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scoffold, or sunk to the lowest and most abject misery. In Brussels and in other cities where he was passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent arduousness with which his companion fought for the centres of all modelable vices; there he cried out in all the spirit of the faro lable: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and there he lost even more than he earned; but it was always with the same face of unhangjrig, with the which he generally looked at the around society: it was not, however, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a large family; then he very desire seemed strong-\nthe law of one — this apparent abstractness of the spirit was laid set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while mourning with the mouse half dead. In each down, hc left the youth formerly rich, turn of the circle he looked, cursed, in the solild of a dragon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this fiendal; while rnany a father sat frantic, in the midst of the eyes scattered from silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his last immense wealth, whroughith to huy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last golder, he had just pulled himself out of the convulsion five taken from the innocent: this could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fight against the trick of the most expiating. Aubrey often seized him to represent him, and begged him to resign from this charity and plea which proved the ruin of all, and did not tend to own his own profile ;— but He dislodged him, for on the day he hopped his friend would give him some opportunity of speaking frankly and timely to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his career, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; arid though Aubrcy was near the object of his curiosity, being obsessed with her no greater gratification than the touching excitement of violent wanting to break this mystery, whipping to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernaturai.\nThey soon arrived at Rame, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion; he allowed him to attend every day the marning circle of an Italian country, as he went in search of the memorials of another deserted almost the city. While he was engaged, letters came from England, which he exhaled with acute impatience; the first was frowned by his sister, breathing nothing of affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonished him; had he previously entered into iriolo his imagination that there was an evil power in his companion, the seome to give him sufficient reason to believe. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and exhorted that the basic character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his licencable habits more dangerous to society. It was discovered bad, he was able to fight for the bad adult not ordination in the hatred of the hor character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinacle of the urisulized virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, the thosos women who were sought, apparently on the agreement of their virtue, had, since his departure, even threw the mask at the help, and had not scrupulously exposed all their vices to the gas public e.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the house character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon him completely, purge, in the sense, to watch him inornate closely, and not to let pass any slight circumstances by urinotism. He entered the same circle, and soon received, which his Lordship endorsed working until the inexperience of the lady daughter he frequented in the house. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is in society; there is an obligation to wear her plaris in secret; but Aubrey eye has followed bim iri all her windings, and soon he has foiled an assigration bid being appointed, which would end the most likely in the ruin of an incident, the over girl without thought. Losing did not have time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked him for his iritentioris with regard to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her at the same night. Lord Ruthven replied that his interests were such that he believed that everything would go without an opportunity, and that after having been preferred if he intended to marry him, he merely laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing a note, to say, that he should disappoint at that time that he was accompanying his Lordship in the remainder of the proposed visit, he ardently his servant to look for another apartment, and by calling the lady's mother, informed him of AlI will know, not only with the requisition to his daughter, but also by styling the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; but he did not insinuate any suspicion that he had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey took his steps towards Greece, and crossed Peninfula, quickly found himself in Athens. He then fixed his position in the house of a Greek; and soori himself took care of himself by tracing the faded traces of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, had darkened themselves to chronicle the acts of the freemen only before the sales, had set themselves as a pledge under the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvases, the promised hope of faith in Mohammed paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that none of them could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, oria would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of her beauties; for who could have extirpated her eyes, apparently the eye of the arimal nature, for this luxury smelting look of the animal avit, but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accampanied Aubrey in his search after antiquities, and often would be the inconceivable girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, floating like he wires upori the wind, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the milk that he has just decipted on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often her tressos would fall, while she wilted arourid, exhibited in the ray of the sun, then such delicately shiny and swistly discoloring dyes, he might well excuse the sorgetness of the antiquarian, who lev escape from his reindeer even the very object that he had before thought of the vital importance to the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why the charms that all the expense, but none appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, disused by crowded drawing rooms arid stisling balls. While he was drawing these remains of whoh he wanted to preserve a memorial for his suture hours, sbe would be st and by, and look at the magic effects of his pccil, iri trace the scenes of his nalive place; she would then describe him the circular dance upon the plclin open, painted, to him in all the colors glowing of the Yautbful memory, the marriage pump sheremembered viewing in her infancy; and lhen, turning to subjects that had obviously made more imprefion on his mind, would tell him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. His sincerity and his faith in what she told exasperated the very interest of Aubrey; and often, as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of his friends, and of the dear bonds, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful snooze to prolong his existence if there were morithes, his hlood would run coid, while he tried to laugh at it from these idle and horrible fantasies; but Ianthe cried at hlm the names of men, who had finally detected one living among them, after many of their parents and children had been found to be marked with the seal of the friend's appetite; and that she found him to be his joredullous, she begged him to believe, for he had been noticed, that these wbos had doubted to question the existence, always had proof that forced them, with pain and heart, to confess it. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monfters, and his horror was unbelieving, hearing a pretty descriptian from Lord Ruthven; however, he still persuaded by persuading her, that there could be no truth in his fears. At the same time, he wondered about many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling himself to bits and more to mention; his innocence, so counterfeited with all the affected virtues of the TB women among whom one had sought for his vision of romance, won his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marry-\nHe was even more attached to the most small fairy shape before the hjm. Hc was tearing himself to the timos of her, and, forming a plan for some antiquari search, he decided not to return until his object had been ottentated; but he always found impossible of six his ottention on the river around him, while in his mind he retained an image that shows only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Nathan was unrecognizable of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite heavings, while her guardian was busy in the skelching or deportation of a fragment that had yet escaped the time of the structural hand. She wrongly appealed to her parents on Vampyres' suffering, and they both, with a several present, affirmed their existence, palo with horror in the name very. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to hold on to one of his oxen, which was to detach him for a few hours; they heard the name of the placo, all of a sudden he hastened not to return to the vicinity, because he had to necessarily pass by a wood, where no Greok or to stay, after the day had closed, on the clean consl deration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their nativity orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of the reprobations of lheir, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he put on them with the fhudder in a hole so daring to mock a fuperor, an infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood freeze, was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey went on his excursion without lingering; he was surprised to obsess the melanoholic face of the host bis, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired him with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly prayed to him to return, and the night allowed him to put the power of the lhese beings in action ;—ho promised. However, he was so busy in search for this, that he only pereved the light of the day would soon end, and that on the horizon there were of these flies whoooh, in the warmer climates, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage over the devolved country .—He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined your make-up by the speed of his delcly: but it was too late. The twilight, in the unknown almost all of these elitams to the south, sets immediately the sun, the night begins: and it had advanced far. The power of the storm was above — it echoed thunders had fcarcely a resting interval — its heavy thick rain forced its entanglement to fall the foliage of the canopy, while the blue forked lightning seemed to fall engulfed radiate at its own feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally stopped because of fatigue, and found, by the glare of lightning, it was in the vicinity of a hole that hardly rose from the massif of dead leaves and the wood surrounding it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a somo to guide the hive towards the city, or at least relying on the oblain sholter from the pelting of the storm. As he approached, the thunders of a silent mountain allowed him to hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with him, suffocating, exulting mockery of a laugh, continued in a smileful armost unbrokeri ;— he was surprised: but, awakened by the thunder who rolled again on his head bis, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the But it is true. He sent him down into darkness; but the noise guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for he called, and the sounds continued, and no no police was taken from him. He himself sounds in contact with someone who he immediately grasps; when a voice shouted ,\" Again basfled !\" And he lay down himself, struck by him whose superman was strong, determined to sell his life as dearly as possible, he wrestled; he beat in vain; he was lifted up with fram bisfect and cast him with enormous force against the ground; his enemy fell upon himself, and knelt on his chest, and knelt his hands on his throat, when the brightness of many torches penetrated through the throat that gave Eight in the day, disturbed hlm; he rose up tirelessly, and lev-\nHe rushed through the do or, in a moment, the crushing of the branches, as he crossed the wood, was not longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by the touch without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the wall of the wind, and the thatch loaded on any individual straw with heavy soft flakes. Al the desire of Aubrey lhey sought for her who had attracted him to his crimes; he felt agairi left in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches once again burst him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a Corsica lifeless. He closed his eyes, hoping to fight. It was only a vision that came forth from his troubled imagination; but to be again seen the shape some, when he unlocked them, stretched by the high side. There was no color on his cheek, no even on his Iip; yes, there was dizziness about his foe which seemed almost as attached to the life that once inhabited the threshing :—pon his neck and broast was blood, arid on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— for men poiriled, crying, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" To Vampyre! A vampire !\" A l letter was quackly formed, and Aubrey was lost by the fidelity of her who had recently been the subject of so many brilliant and faired visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in charge. He did not know what the thoughts were: his mind was tainted with arid seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy—ho held almost unconsciously in his hand, a naked dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin of a lho. They were welcomed by various parties who were engaged in the search for the beer that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city of Lho, preceded the parents of a terrible cotastrophe. — To describe the sorrow that would be possible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the cross. They were unconscious lable; both died in the heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in such intervals would be called to Lard Ruthven and on Ianthe—by a certain uriaecounlable combination seems to be beg from his former companion to spare the binge he loved. At other times, he imprecato curses on his beads, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his permanent guardian. When he withdrew from his delirium, he was hurried and flourished at the sight of hjm whose image had now been combed with that af at Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, almost repentant kindly for the fail which had caused their separation, and even more by the attentiori, society, and care which he showed, soon reconciled his presence. His lordsbip swollen quite; he appeared only the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalcence began to be rapid, he again gradually retlred in the sarned state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, except that it was only at the very moment that he was surprised to meet his circle fixed on him, with an af malicious smile exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves without tides agitated by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of these words, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes to all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elastia of the spirit that had once so distinguished him, the river seemed to have fled forever. Today he was as fond of solitude and silene as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wished for solitude, his mind could not find him in the quarter of Athens; he drew her out of the ruins he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe sto. od by his side — if to be sought in the words, his light step approaching in the middle of the Ood darkness, in spite of modest purple tho; their suddenly lunning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his palo arid face throat wounded, with a sweet smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, all of which created bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Steven, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from them during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had again seen. They traveled in all the diroclions, searching for each place to remember a memory; but although they hadtened from one place to another, they did not shake to hear what they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, when they imagined that they were just over a million people. As a result of this neglect, the council of the inhabitants, on one occasion, they used only a few cards, more to serve as guides than as a reference. On entering, however, a narrative defilement, at the bottom of which was the heel of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the Negro precipices, they had a reason to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly any wholo of the party swallowed up in its narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, and by the ratio exhumed of several cannons. In an iristarit, their guards had loft them, and, standing behind the rocks, had been to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, imitating lheir, for example, withdrew for a moment behind the short turn of defilement: but hard to be so owned by an enemy, who with insulting shuls told them advance, and being exposed to the slaughter without mercy, if only thieves should climb up and take them back, they determined to one to rush in search of tho money. Hardly, they had lost shelter from the rock, that Lord Ruthven received a shot in the shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistant; and, no long or attention to competition or his own peril, is soon surprised by shaking the faces of the rabbis around him — his guards having immediately thrown their arms at Lord Ruthvens wounded.\nBy promises of reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and after receiving a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, being content simply to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised surname, for which he held an order. Lord Ruthvenly rapid strength diminished; in two days death was made, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had had objects about him: hut towards the near afth last night, his spirit became apparently unosy, and his eyes often fixed on Aubrey, who was prompted to offer his help with more than usual solicitation —\" Help me! You can get me drunk – you can do more than that – I don't mean life only. I listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would like to do anything ,\" I replied to Aubricky. \" I need, but a few things — my life flourishes — I do not explain the quilo — but if you hide everything from me, my candy was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death had been unknown for some time in England — I — but life. \"-\" We don't know him. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising him up with an exultant violence ;\"Swear that your soul may resent, with all your fears, swear, for a year and a day, without you giving your knowledge of my crimes or dates to any living being, in any way whatsoever, of what can happen, or of what you can see .\" \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he was running down the pillow, he was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; there were many circumstances that saw his knowledge with the man, and he did not know why; and when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if, from the presentation, something horrible was waiting for him. In the morning, he was almost 0 to enter the house in which he had licked the corpse. When a thief met him, orid informed him that it was no longer there, having been transported by his sons and emradcs, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, that he would have exposed himself to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey stunned, and took several of the men, discouraged going and buried it on the toad where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no traco or body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the same stone on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was amazed at the consequences, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had met such terrible unhealthys, and the girl who apparently got involved in this superstitious melancholy that seized his mind, he resolved to love him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to organize these effects with him, throwing to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several offone bone weapons, more or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There was never a daggersand attack. What turned them towards, and examined their curious forms, what was his surprise to find a wreath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hasteri to obtain more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he had climbed, though pecul-\nIn a good shape, he held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty — they seemed to be linked to the dagger; but he still wanted disease; but the particular shape, the same traits variable on the haft and sheolh were similar in splendor on the boème, and for fear that there would be no room for doubt; there were also blood drops on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first investigations were concerning the lady whom he had tried to see from Lord Ruthvens' executive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard of him since the departure of her lordship. Aubrey's spirit almost broke under horrors, so money repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen victim to the Haitian destroyer. He becomes morose and slender; and his only oosted profession by exhorting the speed of postilions, just as he will save the life of someone he has held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tossed a bim on the banks of the English; and he hastened at the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the foot. If she made sure, by the irifantine caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eye and applauded the salon's ossemblies. Thero was not of this light shine that only comes out in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was illuminated by the levity of the heneath spirit. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to come from misfortune, but from a feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. Its step is not so light, which goes astray where a butterfly or a color can alternate – it was sedated and pensive. Nothing but Wheri, her face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when ber bouilloncr broke to her affection, and would be in her presence forget those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, who would have changed her smile for that of the voluntary? It seemed that of these eyes — the that face then played in the light of their own native shape. She was still only a sting, and had not been introduced to the world. He had been thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation should be delayed upon the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now, for that reason, that the next living room, which approaches quickly, had to be the coach of its entry into the \"bvsy scene\". Aubrey would rather have remained in the house of his father, and had had enough of the melancholy that carried him away. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolities of the fashionable stranger, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events that he had seen; but he decided to saterify his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They came into the town, and prepared for them the next day, which should be announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive – a riot that had been rioting for a long time, arid all those who were eager to rest in the kingship smile, hastened. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account everything that aborted him, he undertook to remember that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there, feeling suddenly saw by his arm, and a voice he was feeling too well, sounded in his ear ---\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, because he saw a spectre exploding him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place until his first entry into society. He looked until his limbs refused to carry the weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his carriage, and walls led home. He passed the room with pressed steps, crouched his hands on his head, if he feared that his thoughts would weaken with his hrain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, who could not believe that it was possible — the dead are resurrected again !— He said that his imagination had conjured the Imago on which his mind rested. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back into society; for he intended to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining the information. He went a few nights after with his sister to the assemble of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matriori, who retired into a process, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally seeing that many people were waking up, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed to him those traits that he despised most. And he took the arrn of his sister, and with a leap he forced it to the artery; and at the gate he was hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was erected by passing them, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :\"Remember your oath !\" He did not turn to television, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to his house.\nAubrey was almost a mistake. If before his mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was riddled, now that the certainty of the living agony of the monster has pressed on his thoughts. The attention of his sister was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that the sube intimidated him to explain to him what had used his abrupt conduct. He said only a few words, and these words...\nI defied her. He is more disconcerted than he is. His oath began ;— was he then to roam, sobbing on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid progress? His sister could have been naked by him. But even if he were yours to break his oath, and to break his fuspicions, who would be a swallow? He thought of using his own hand to free the world had shaken such a misery; but death, he remembered, child beer had already mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only his sister name, who, with tears, suffocating eyes, begged Bim, for her, to support nature. Finally, he is no longer able to wear stilitude and loneliness, he leaves his house, wanders from the street to the street, eager to steal this image that haunts him. His dreams have become neglected, and he wanders, also often exposed to a midday check on the Wets of Midriight. It was no longer to be recognized; at the first check return with the evening at the house, though, hut at the paw hc dropped it down to rest wherever fatigue exceeded him. His sister, anxious for his safety, used people also to follow a bim; but they were soon deciphered by bim about the field of a faster procedure anything — of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, were left with the presence so unconscious as they were, he decided to enter society again, and to look at him positively, anxious in advance, in spite of his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with inli-\nIt is a Macy. But when he entered a room, his distrustful and rogue gazes were so frustrating, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg to abstclin to seek, for her, a society that touched the hive so strongly. When, however, the demonstration proved to be impeccable, the guards bartered proper to influence, and, fearing that his mind was becoming alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had previously been imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nChallenged to save bim from the wounds and chokings that he had daily in his wonders, and to prevent him from expressing these marks of what they were insanity to the general eye, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and took care of him constantly. He hardly seems to notice, so he gives himself the mind absorbed by the terrible subject of one. His invention 6 is finally so big, that he was confined to his room. There, he could often lie for days, unable to be awake. He could become emaciated, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and recollection left was shown upside down the entrance of his sister; then he would be caretaking to begin, and, taking hold of his hands, it seems that he allegedly offended him, he wanted her not tooub. \"Oh, touch him at the riot, if your love presents me, come near him !\" Where, however, she asked what he mentioned, his only answer was ,\"True! True !\" And he fell back into a slate, from which she didn't even drive it. This lost many morithes: gradually, however, as the year passed, his inconsistencies became less frequent, and his inind threw from cl portiori of his morosity, but his guards observed that several times in the day he counted upori his finger an infinite number, then smiled.\nThis time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room began to converse with his doctor upon the melancholic circumstance of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when if a sister would laugh the day to get married. Instantly, everybody's attention was drawn; he asked anxiously whom. Happy with this mark of the insect, which they feared had been deprived of, they mentioned the name of the Count of Mclrsden. Thinking that it was the young Earl he had met in society, Aubrey seemed bent, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be a pre-sent to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his check, wet with tears, flowing the idea that his brother was once again alive to the feelings of afsection. He began to speak with all his warmth gained, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distyngued from a far arid rank accomplishment; when he suddenly perccivod a medallion on his chest; open it, what was his surprise to spoil the characteristics of the monster who had so long influenced his life. On his question hlm why he thus destroyed the appearance of her father husband, he looked as if he had not underestimated her — then by taking hold of her hordes, arid looking at her with a frantic expression of couritenan this, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monster, because he — but he could not advance it — he was paid as if this voice told him to remember his ooth again — he turned abruptly around, thinking that Lord Rut hven was near him but saw no one. In the meantime, the guards and the physician, who had heard the whole, and who thought it was only the return of his disorder, entered, and forced him from Miss Aubrey, told her to leave him. He fell on his knees towards them, begged, begged to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the madness they imagined having seized his doctor, eventually pacified him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvenhad called The morning after the living room, and asked all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be bardly concealed from those among whom information had been obtained. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by the constant presence, and the claim of great affection for the mother and interest in his destiny, he gradually became the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? His tongue has bad dangers and tools to tell—could speak of himself cls of an individual who had no sympathy with no eyes on the watered earth, savc with whom he was oddly glittering1f ;— could say to the bow, since one knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, except thal that he was buzzing with his soothing accents ;— in line, he knew so well that I know how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will of destiny, thal he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fell to him in length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (despite the state of his brother's state ), which was to take place the day before he left for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicion and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she closed her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and hope of their house, to delay but for a few shovels that marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would delirate him; but to give him to the doctor, he thought that he did not belt to haros plus the spirit of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night stopped without rest to the occupied inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that can be more easily designed than described, the well-filled preparation notes. The morning came, arid the sound of carriages broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The cur -.\nIosity of the servants finally overcome their vigilance, they gradually stolo away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman powerless. He seized the opportunity, with a bonded one, was out of the room, and at the time was found in the trim where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, satisfied him with the room, without a voice with fury. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear in the vice ,\" Remember thy oa tb, and know, I am not my bride in the day by day, the sister is dishonored. Women are careful !\" He said ,\" He pushed him to the bis, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in the seram from him .\" Aubrey could no longer stand; his rage, not finding it devoid, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was convaded in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he took off, as the doctor was ragged with her agitation. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and husband left Londori.\nAubreys ircreasity; blood shedding of produced symptoms of the near-dead of approach. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when the midnight hover struck, he relatod compostedly what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guards settled down to proclaim Miss Aubrey; but when they grabbed it, it was too late. Lord Ruthveri had disappeared, and our sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, GIVE A ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\" The wart was in front of him, where to choose his resting place, and Providence his guidance.\nE .\"\nIN said passing through the Greek archipelago, on board one of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we misgusto the port of Milylene, in the land of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables still have to be there, engulfed many British ships to visit it — both warmen and merchants; and although he is standing out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums amply reimburse for the violation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the mcn was used in watering, arid the purescr to the mercandiring for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and rnyfelf at or a rain to the cove called Homer School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a narrated girl) we met the engaged and a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our cultural in his culture. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would raise me a pair with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house above the hill, facing the river lhc, belongs to him, and he has 1ft an old man in the charge of him: he gave Dominick, to the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 Currency-\ny ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails in the hls festival very often on the different islands .\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity very much, and we did not lose time, iri hastily to the house where our peasant had resided. We were well received by an old Indian, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments in the ground floor — an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting porlour, and a bedroom, with a spacious closet attached. They were all simply decorated: a light green wall, marble tables on each side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a fixed spring on the side of the small Venus bronze iri, a lean posture; a large hood or sofa completed the furniture. Iri the half stood half an English dozon cane chairs, and an empty case book: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The hedchamher had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with a cotton bed, stuffed and a pillow, the corn bed throughout Greece. In the still, we observed a marble recreation, once, told us the old man, filled with books and papers, who were then in the chest of a great seam in the envelope: it was open, but we did not think that the muscles justified examining the content. In the recesfs tablet, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, of Rousseau are finished; the Rujns of the Empires of Volricy; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Mjlton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinople, very torn, but not English of any dowry. Most of the lhesis books were filled with marginal laughs, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The lord had read the books of the sc in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must remain there until his return; for he is so particular, that if I died a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; he is otherwise very good. I made him a service, and I made the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of it, except twenty zechins that I pay to an elderly Arnenian who is redone in a small contract in the wood, and which the word brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was pleasant. The portico at the front was long and wide, and the pearls of marble canned with black plinths and working cornice of frets ,( as it is now the usual architecture iri. Greek) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone balustrade, was covered with a sinus turkey carpet, under the air store of strong Corsican linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, because on the Greeks spend their excesses on tobacco, drinking high wines, such as \"lachryrna Christian\", eating fruit, arid enjoying the breeze evening.\nOn the left, you enter the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and limes were chained together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back, on which we said, the lord spent many bis evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, scribeg, and speaking to myself. \"I begged,\" call the old man ,\"praying\" away, he was devoted very ,\" and always went to our church twice a week, in addition to Sun Declys .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries bloom iri, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A single room emitted by the rules descended from the cascades of the iri brokon, until it was lost in the forest near the baso de la morin. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the vlew in front; and a little on fear, through a view of 10fty coconut on palm trees, small several islands were observed distinctly, spreading the light blue wave with emergency green spots. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our ququiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic soljtude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Caridie. \"The Armenian\" said our doctor ,\" Could he say it, but I am not sure that he is not ,\" he said ,\" and can you not say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenians, but on our return to the city, we learned several details of the isolated lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to the man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often ran the Greek Testaments for poor children. In the school, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstratory that we learned, which our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to discography. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had given him a piano-strong, and gave him the use of himself.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylerie; our imaginations everything on the rack, guess who this crawler in Greece could be. The money was obvious: he had a philanthropy of depression, and these eccentricities mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our duplicates were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The undivided,\" he said ,\"about whom yauare so anxious, is Lard Byron; I met him on my trips to East 1 and Tenedos, and I also visited him at Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his Lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Cbilde Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla on every page. Did we not regret not having been more relieved in our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylone on a future day; but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely insensitive, and in justice in the good name of her secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive device, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or to add its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their seat in his home. The tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his abilities; and his wrath of the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon whose heart, the Religion sealed his seal, and upon whose head, the bath of Benevolence cast his coat. No man can read the pleasant preceding \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respects his love or pleasure, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Reports must be welcomed with caution, especially when they violate the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where all must appear, Alono can censor the error of a controversial. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. The surest testimony of a virtue, he artes and of self-approving coriscience is to go away in secret and avoid applause from the world.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Pririter, Crown Court, Feet-Street.",
    "38": "e: THEVAMPYRE;\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it took its present form only since the division of the Latin and Greek churehes; at the time the idea was predominant, that a Latin body would not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, it increased gradually, and cultivated the subject of the wonderful stories, many, still oxtarit, bone it died rising from their graves, and coding on the blood of the yaung arid beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where there were beliefs, that the uampyres soaked up some of the blood of their victims, that 0 became einacized, lost their strength, and died quickly of consumed; while these hurnan sucking fat blood—and their veins distended to such a state of the repletion, as to cause the blood flow lots of all the passages of their body, and even the pores themselves of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is an eurious and, of course, credible account of a particular case of democracy, what is happening in America, Hungary. He opposed the fact that, in the examination of the chief commander and the local militias, positively and unanimously asserted that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Pau l, would have heard that, in Cassova, at the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a wcly to get rid of evil, by exhaling some bones from the earth out of the fat of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being heenmented by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresb, and whole free of corruption, and emitting to movth, nose, and cells, pure florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was cast entirely the heart and body of Arnold Paul, where it is reported to have also shouted terribly as if he had been alive. This did, cut his head off, burned his body, and threw the crampons into his grave. The same efforts were made to ensure that the forces of these people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others that occurred.\nThe universal belief if that a person sucked by a varnpyre becomes a vampire itself, and sucks iri this turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis inconstructive rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of these observations than any other instance, it might add. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for a crime ommmttedwhilst ommmjtwhilst in existence, that the deceased is not only sentenced to vampyriso, but forced to corrify his infernal visits salary to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposlition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from the tomb of them; and then hideously haunt the place of origin, and sigh the blood of all thy rod; from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, A nriding the drain tho stream of lisie; yet locltbe the banquet that performeth Muft feedeth thy ivid living oorse, thy victians shall still expiate, and shall know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest, thou cursest them, thy kidneys shall be dried upon the stem. But whoever dropped your crime, the youngest, loved everyone, will bless you with the name of a father. This word will envelop your heart!! Yet, you must put an end to your arid task marks the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see which freezes his lifeless blue; Theri with the unhalifated hand tears The braid of his yellow hair, including, in life, a lock when the thorn of the affection-carried wall engagement — But now is carried away by Shoe Memorial of thin agony! But if your best blood is flowing, your teeth grinning and your lip wreaking; then, tracking your tomb of sulleri, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in horrors turn away from the spectre more cursed than they.\nSouthey also presented in his wild best beautiful poem of \"ThaIaba\", the vampyr course of the young Arab Republic, who is represented after having returned from the grave in order to torment him, she loved better during the iri existerico. But it is not supposed to have resisted the sinfulness of her life, it was poured into the narrative as a complete type of purity and innocence. The true Toumefort girds a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, for what he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, in addition to a variety of anecdotes, and lradiary accounts illustrating the effects of it, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove it to be a classical, as well as barbaric error.\nAlthough it is possible to add this singularly horrible superstition for the limits of a note, necessarily devoted to explanction, and which can now be consolidated by the simple remblaking, thal although the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, the use of nade in different ports of the world: like Vroucalocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloko, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the middle of the period of dissipation on a London victory...\nIt appeared to the various parts of the leaders of the story, a novelman, more noticed for its singularities, than its rank. He was watching the mirth around the hall, just as he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the righteous oracle tied his waiter, which he scrambled by a cold look well, and throw the sea into the breasts where the infidelities reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could explain the riot from where it aroso: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, six on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of leadership which weighed on the skin that he could pass. The peculiarities of Hjs prompted him to be invited to every house; all wanted the seo, and those who bad beer accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were pleased to have something in their presence capable of engalling their attention. Iri despite the deadly hue of her face, which has gained a warmer hue, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong cmotion ofpassiori, although its shape and the beautiful white contours, many of the women after the notoriety tried to gain her attention-\nLady Mercer, who had been the mockery of all the monsters who had appeared in the drawings since her marriage, threw herself into her way, and set herself in motion, but put herself on the top of a mountain bank, to attract her attention :— although in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, although it seemed as they were unperceived ;— even her impudence inapplauded walls baffled, arid she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence the direction of her eyes, just was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent climax with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he had never addressed the female. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and if he was that it even overcomes the fear of his singular character, or girl they were moved by his apparently warm vice, he was also often among the women who make up the boast of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young Geritleman named Aubrey arrived in Loridon: he was an orphan left with an ordinary sister in possession of great riches, by priests who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the guards, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important charge of his mind to the care of the sublateral mercenaries, he was more of his imaginative lhari his judgment. He had, therefore, this high romantic home of honor and frankness, which every day destroys so many fears of millions. Hc believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was thrown by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply eonistrated in the garment, which were also hot, but which were better suited to the paintereyo by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, arid and rich.\nnews, when he entered gay circles, many mothers were surrouding him, stretching who should describe with the least truth, their languishing or scrambling favorites: the girls at a certain point, by the luminant faces when he approached, and by the gleaming eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in face notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his political hour, he was surprised to find that, except in the fallow and wax candles that flackered, not the presence of a ghost, but srom lacks snuffing, the era was not foundation in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant pictures and descriptions contained in these volumes, from where he had formed his studies. However, to find a composition in his gratified vanity is to be abhorrent to requisition his dreams, when the extraordinary being that we described above, went through him in his career.\nHe looked at the bim; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man abhorred in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of extremal objects, which the tcleit acquired in their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of contact with lbeir: to allow his imagination to imagine what flattered the propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the thus object in the hcro of a romance, and decided to observe the progeny of his string, rather than the person before him. He made himself known with him, paid attention to him, and, until now, advariated on his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. Hc gradually learns that Lord Rutbvens osfairs have been embroiled, and soori found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that it was about a ttrovel. Desiring to obtain some information about the singularity of the latter, which, until now, had only shaken his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to tour, that it was considered necessary to hold on to young people to take a few steps in the career of voice in order to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to opt as a fallon of the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of ploasantry of praise, according to the degree of skill shewn by matching them ori. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of the system of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he welcomed him with joy, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had a bad chance of studying Lord Ruthvcn's character, and it is now found that, although much more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives of the high conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— idleness, vagaband, and beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing that it was not on the virtuovs, reduced to indigencc by the accompanying malfortunos, even on virtue, that he understood his alms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to waste in his lust, or to sink it even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This waf, however, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the victim, which will generateally prevals over the retiring bashfulness of the virtuous indigenous. There was a circumstratory about the inheritance of the Lordship, which was even more impressive on his mind: all those on whom he was hestowed, inevitably found that there was a curse on it, because they were either ail led to a lack scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and the most awful misery. In Brussels and in other cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent ardour with which his comparison sought the centres of all the sashionable vices; he entered there into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and he lost even more than what he earned; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which which generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the young novice rashful or the father without chance of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be fortune law – this apparent abstraction of mind was set aside, and his eyes split with more fethari that of the cat while wilting the mouse half dead. In every city, hell, the old youth flocked, torn from the circle, he looked, cursed, in the loneliness of a dungeon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this wilt; while many father big frenetic, in the midst of being speaking looks of mute hungry children, without a single farthing of his late riches imrnenso, who are with to buy an oven enough to satisfy their present desire. Yethe did not take remorse from the gamling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last dorlot which he had just pulled from the convulsive grip of the innocen t: it could be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to remember the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from thischarity and plea that proved the ruin of Cll 1, and did not make his own profit ;— but he dilated it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him the sneaky and open opportunity to speak to him; to bow, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his cligage, and in the midst of various wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and though Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not get to groat the grotification from it than the constant excitement of vainly wanting the escape mystery thal, which to his exalted imagination begari to assume the appearance of some hjng supernaturai.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey, for a while, lost sight of his companion; he left him daily sitting in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memories of another deserted city of Alinoste. While he was so engaged, the letters came from England, and he opened with impatience; the fir came from his sister ,6 said nothing again to the effect of a bull; the others came from hif guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered into his imagination, there was an evil power resident of his companion, these seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediate departure from his friend, and vrged that his stalker c was terribly vicious, because it was the possession of irresistible powers of seductians, made his licencable habits more dangerous to focus. It had been discovered that bis eonempt for adultery had not ordained in the hatred of his character; but lhal had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, should be cast from the pinnacle of unsullied virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously to expose all the desolation of their vices, the public gaze.\nAubrey did not recommend the lia-\nhaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to keep him away from the oltogelher, purposing, in the while way, look to look at him inore consciously, and not to let pass any circumstances slightly without attention. Ho entered the irito circle scheme, and soon perceived that his seigneury was striving to work upon the experience of the girl girl of the lady of which he mainly frequented houso. In Italy, just so rarely that on the unmarried female is met with ln society; he was therefore obliged to continue his planf in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been opioided, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent, though unthinkable girl. Not losing time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked him his intentions with respect to your lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of being about to meet her tonight. Lord Ruthuen replied that his interests were such that he thought that everything would have had an opportunity in such a fuch; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from that moment he must declare accompanying his Lordship in the reminder of their tour project, he ordered his servant to sow other apartmerits, and calling the mother to the lady, informed him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his goddaughter, but also cancering the character of his Lordship. The pre-truth will be an assignment. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but did not hijack any suspicion of his plans that had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nhaving left Rome, Aubrey directed his step past towards Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon he found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the bosom of a Greek; and soon he took care of the faded traces of ancient glory on inunumerits which, apparently, shameful to chronicle the acts of free men only before the slaves, had hidden themselves for the benefit of the sheltering ground or many colored lichens. Under the same roof as himself, existing being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a washing planter to pour on this canvases, promised the hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could lie down to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or tripped along the side of the inuntain, it would have been thought that gazellus was a bad type of his beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the animated natural eye, for this luxurious sleepy look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Avbrey in the hif search of antiquities, and often wovld the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of ka shmero Butterfly, showed them all the beauty of his form, floccating as he was on the wind, lo the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on a dazzling almofl, in the contemplation of his figurc sylph-like. Often, her falling braids, as she wilted around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so deliciously brilliantly shine and weakening swissly from the bushes, it could be that we excite the oblivion of the anomaly, which let escape from her mind the very object which had before thought of the vile importance to the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But if we try to describe chorms, but no one can appreciate it ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, untouchable by overcrowded drawing rooms arid stifling ball. As he drew the rcains from which he wanted to pass a memorial away from his future hours, she stopped, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, tracing the scenes of his notifying place; she would then describe him the crying dance on the open plain, painted, to him in all the brilliant colours of yoursful memory, the sherremembered marriage pump viewing inher infancy; and then, turning to subjects who had had the euidential made a greater impression on the spirit of the ber, would tell him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. Her gains and her belief applauded her for what she had set in, aroused the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, wbo had spent years in the midst of her hornets, the most dear arid ties, forced the excrement year, feeding on the lily of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the following months, his blood would be cold, while he tried to laugh at her of such an idea and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe quoted her the names of the old men, who had finally detected one living among them, after several bones their relatives relatius and evil children were found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when she found bim so incredulaus, she begged him to believe, for he had been noticed that those who dared to coexist with existence, had always had proof that had forced them, full of sorrow and sorrow, to confess. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror was magnified, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; however, still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her fears, although al the time wondered about the multitude of incidences that had all tended to excite a belief in the natural punctual power of Lord Rulhven.\nAubrey began to attach more and more himself to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, when his heart; and while being ridiculed the idea of a young man of English sapils, marrying an uneducated Greek girl, he was still more and more attached to the almost fairylike form before him. He sometimes ripped it from it, arid, forming a plan for an antiquarian reseclroh, he went away, determined not to return until the bis object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention to the rvjns around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his goods. Although Ianthe was unconscious of his love, arid was always the same frank innatile he had known for the first time. She always seemed to share it with the reluctanco; but it was the cause, she no longer had anyone with whom she could screw her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or discovering the fragment of some which had yet escaped the crow of the time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they warm, with the present sooveral, affronted their existence, pale with the horrary in the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; if they heard the name of the place, all at once begged him not to return to laugh, or he must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it as the vampy tip station in their nocturnal orgies, arid annoyed the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to reject them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling with his daring, mocking himself with a superior, an infernal power, the same name bone, which, at the time, had frozen their blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey salt off on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy space of his host, and worried that his words, mocking the belief of these horrific waves, had inspired them with terror such. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, the night was all the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not see that the light day would soon end, that in the horizon there was one of these spots which, in warmer climates, gather so quickly in a mass of tremendouf, and pour all their rage up the devoted country .— He, however, finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up by the speed of his delay: but he felt too late. Two fires, in these southern climatos, are almost unknown; immediately sunsets, beginning at night; and then he had advanced far. The power of the storm was above — his thunders echoed barely had a resting interval — heft heavy rain forced his way through the canopy foliage, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate to very smelly birds. Suddenly, his horso became afraid, and he was carried with the rapid dreadful beat the entangled forest. The criminal finally, through the fatigue, stopped, arid he found, by the dazzling of the lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel that barely raised just upwards of the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood that turned it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him, or to be confident to get a shelter against the storm of Tbe. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible frieks of a wine mixing with the stifled laughter, exulting and mocking, continued in an almost uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised: bvt, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, opened the door of the hvt. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, sipped it. He was apparently not perceived; sorry, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remark was made of him. He found himself in contact with someone who seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Again mocked !\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt caught up by him whose strength the superhuman would hold: determined to sell his strong life, he was able to fight; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his sight and fasted with a great candle against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torchos penetrating the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;— he rose up unshakeably, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and at the moment when the crack of the branches, as he broke through the burber, was not heard. The storm was still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the valleys of mud, and the thatched loaded ori each individual straw with heavy flaaks of soot. At Aubreys will, they loved him who had attracted him to his screams; he was again in darkness; but what horror his horror, when the light of the torches united more bursl on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he again sowed the same form, when he delivered them, stretched by his side. There was a rio color on his cheek, not even his lip, but there was a silence on his face that seemed to be the most attached of life that once lived in there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the level :— to this man pointed, crying, simultaneously scared themselves of horror ,\" A vampire! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Avbrey was laid next to her, who recently began to bimble the object of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in it. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held almost unconsciously in his bare hand dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the hut. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had been engaged in the sea of her, which a mother had missed. Their lamentable critics, as they approached the city, prevailed over the parents of a terrible catastrophe. — To defuse their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsotable; both died in the heart of the broken.\nAubrey being pvt to bed was seized with a violent foam fever, and was often of theirious; in these intervals he called upon Lord Ruthven and on Iantbe—by an immeasurable combination he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he impretates the moledictlons on his pearl, the cursed as his destroyer. Lord Ruthvon, had the opportunity of this to arrive in Athens, and from what very molive, the upper audition of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his companion of constancy. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image was now accompanied by that of a Vampyre; but Lord Steven, by his kind words, almost implied repentance for the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care which he showed, soon reconciled his presence. His seigneury seemed to change; it did not appear that the apathelio being wbo had so surprised Aubrey; bul af soan that the bis convalescence began at the 6th rapid, to be regraded in the same state of mirid bone, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference of the old mon, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a pattern of malicious exultation playing his lips vpon: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the tides of tides raised by the cool breeze, or to mark the progress of these words, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— indeed, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of nature, by this shock, was weakened by the mucb, and this spiral elasticity which had once so disconcerted it now seemed to have run away forever. He was as loving today as Lord Ruthven; but, as he wanted for solitude, his spirit could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, the bo had freed himself, the shape of Ianthe stood next to him — if he sought him in the woods, his licker would appear wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest purple; then suddenly rovnd, would show, to wild imagination hjs, his paleness and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which created such bitter oscillations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthveri, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had taken from the hall during his illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and which they had not yet seen. They traveled in the direction of the evocation, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached; but if they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard robbers, but they gradually began to minimize these relationships, which they imagined to be about the invention of the industrials, whose irony was to excite the generosity of those whom they defended against the supposed dangers. Due to the neglect of the residents' counsel, once they travel with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defense. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they had a reason to repent of their neglect; for there was hardly any whole party engaged in narrow plss, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and by the second ratio of several cannons. In an insurrection, their guards had left them, and standing behind the rocks, had begun to turn in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind her...\nBut shameful to be held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, told them to progress, and to be exposed to slaughter without resistance, is only thieves should hang over and take them back, they decided to rush in search of the enemy. Barely had they lost shelter from the rock, queri Lord Ruthven speeded up a blow of iri the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to go to his help; and, no longer taking into account the greatest evil or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Rutbvens wounded, immediately cast their arms and surrendered.\nBy the promise of oatmeal retribution, Aubrey soon brought the wounded frierid hands to a neighbouring eabine; and after accepting a ransom, they were no longer troubled by their presence — they were content to keep the eritronce till their comrade had to come back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed unconscious of the pain. He had been objects on him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his attention with more usual seriousness —\"Afsif me! You save me, you can do more than that. I do not interfere with my life. I am attentive to the date of my existence as little as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little, of my ebbs apace lily, I cannot deploy everything — but if you were to hide all of your kriow form, my honor was fever de spot in the mouth of the arid world if my death was unknown for some time in England — but life. \"—\"It will not be known. \"Jurez !\" cried the dying man, rising himself with exultary violence ,\"Swo ar by all your soul resents, by all your nature fear, boasting that, for a year and a day, you will not lose your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being on the way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. \"His eyes seemed to burst with thorial bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he poured out a laughing upon a bis pillow, arid did not breathe anymore.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances attending his knowledge of this man rose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered he swore a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presentation of something horrifying agitation. Rising early in the morning, he was about to wrap up the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by him and comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon that arose after his death. Aubrey astonished himself, and took several men, determined to go and bury just in the place where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of either the body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the identical rock on which the tobey had laid the body. From far a little, his mind was scrambled in conjectures, but he returned to the class, convinced that they had buried the body for the love of his clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to rise that superstili melancholic that had grasped on his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While he was waiting for a uessel to transmit it to Otranto, or also Japanese, he occupied it to organize the effects he had with them belonging to Lord Ruthven. Amongst the things, the other there was a cold case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. These were the febrile daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them were, and looking at their curious forms, which was his surprise to find a sheath apparently ornamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get more evidence, he found the woman, and his horror can be imagined when one discovers that he adapted, although particularly shaped, the sheath that he held in his h and. His eyes began not to need any other certainty — they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; however, he still wanted to disobey; but the farm porticular, even the variousjng dyed on the haft and shath were like in the splendor on both, and left rio of the place for doubt; there were also hlood sheets on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the gay way to Rome, his first investigations were on the lady whom he had tried to see the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their father was ruined, and she had not been bearded since the dowry of her secretary. Aubreys spirit became almost broken under so many horrors transplanted; he was afraid that this lady had falsified a victim at the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became rnoose and silent; and his only occupation oosted by exhorting the speed of the postilions, as if he were going to save the life of a dear to the hardi oria. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon swollen hall on the English coasts; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, appeared to the place, in the embraces and hearts of his sister, the memory of the past. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she gained the infection, laughing that the woman was beginning to approach, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey had not won a grade that won the gaze and applause of the drawing-room assembled. There was ridiculed by this slight shine which exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apart. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from some sentimenting spirit, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter room. Except not was that foot light, which strays where to wear a butterfly or color can attract — it was sedated and pensive. When alone, the face hurt was never brilliantly brilliantly joyful; but when his brother blew him his defection, and forgot in his presence, those deed that she knew how to destroy the rest bis, who would have excharigoted his smile for the trot of the vampire? Looks like those eyes....\nThis face was a tuna playing in the light of their own native sphere. She has only eightcens yet, and has not been presented to the world, he has been swinter by his guards more in shape than his presentation should be delayed until his brother returned from the continent, when he could be his protector. It is therefore now resolved that the next lounge, which is approaching rapidly, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the marisiori of his sators, and fed him to melancholy who supplanted him. He could not feel intolerant by the frivolities of the fashionablo foreigners, when his miride had been so torn apart by the events that he had riots; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the town, and prepared for the next day, which could be announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held to be a long lime, and all those who were eager to rest in the smile of the kingship, rushed into it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a comer alone, without anything around him, engaged in the real memory, the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place, he felt that he suddenly felt gripped by his arm, on a voice which he also recognized well, sounded in the car —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing to see a blaslhim blaslhim spectator, whom he perceived, at a bit of distance, the same figure who had stirred his opinion on this point until his first entry into society. He looked until his members were almost reluctant to wear their weight, he was obliged to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his clirriago, and was driving home. He passed the room with rushed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would be shrunk from his brain. Lord Ruthven ogain before him-circumstances began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his oath .— He roused himself, being could not believe that he could – died rife again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image his mind was based on. It was impossible that it could be real — he therefore discouraged going back into society; for although he tried to talk concerning Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a close relationship. Leggling her under the production of a matron, he plunged into a corner, and went to his own devoring thoughts. Perceiving, in the last place, that many were leaving, he woke up and entered another room, found his disappearanced by several, apparent in a serious conversation; he began to pass to and approached her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. And he went forth, and took the arm of his sister, which was set in motion, in a hurry, and forced her to the street: and at the door he took himself the multitude of servants, who were waiting for their lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again this voice whispering by him :\"Remember the oath !\"He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, he soon came to him.\nAubrey has become almost distracted. So before his mind was absorbed by the one subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the certainty of the amateur love has once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attention has now gone unanswered, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain to her what caused her sudden conduct. He spoke only a few words, arid those who terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath killed him, and then he allowed this annuitant to wander, to bear the ruiri upon his breath, from the ambulance was asleep, and not to avoid his progress? Maybe his very sister touched him. But even if he broke his oath and revealed his supplications, who would believe him? He was thinking of using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but the death, he remembers, had been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears of spirit, begged him, for his own good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, for fear that busy houses, wanders from street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted the bim. His dress calmed down, and he wandered, as often exhaled in the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was not longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the eternal to the house; but at last he laid a bim until the crisis where fatigue overhangs him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow the bomb; but they were soon distracted by him who was fleeing from a pressure faster than any — from a chest. His driving, however, changed slightly. The idea that he left by his absence to all his friends, with a friend of the omongs, whose presence they were unconscious, he dissuaded from entering society again, and from looking at him close, anxious in advance, despite the oath, all those whom Lord Heaven approached with intimately. But when he entered a roar, his hamburger and his suspicious looks were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, that his fissier was finally forced to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the reason turned out to be unavoiding, the Guordians thought it appropriate to invert, and, fearing that his mind became abandoned, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that was previously imposed by the parents of Aubrey.\nDesiring to blow him off from the wounds and sufferings he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what the madness contained, they instructed a doctor to reside in the house, and to listen to him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice it, if a couple was his mind absorbed by a torible subject. His incoherence became so great in the case that he was conspired in his chamber. He often lied there for days, unable to wake up. He had become an emaoic, his eyes had reached a glassy chandelier ;— the only sign of arid affection reminding himself of his sister's test; then, sometimes, would be beginning, arid, grasping his hands, which seems that gravely distressed, which he wanted her not to tease him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he reproved, her only answer was :\"True! Truo !\" And again, he threw himself into a state, wherever she couldn't raise him. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was possessed, its inconsistencies scaffolded less, and his mind threw a porter of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the day, he counted on himself a definitive number, and the smile lhen.\nThe time had almost passed, when, backwards, the last day, if one of his guards entered his room, began to converse with his physicist on the melancholic circumstance of Aubreyf being in such a horrible situation, when his sister went the next day to be trapped. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he tried to find out who. Glad of this mark of the return of the intellect, when they feared that he was depraved, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. He was a young count he had with me. Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by bis exfusing this intention to be present at the nationals, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to his chest, set on his cheek, tears wet, flowing to the thought of his brother to be once alive to feelings of affection. He started talking with all the hls wonted heat, and congratulated you on his own marriage with a person so distinguished for the rank and each accomplishing; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his breasl; open it up, what was his surprise that the fact of the monster who had infused his life so long. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under the fool. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her, then shaking her hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression in his face, he told her to swear that she would never marry this moribund, for he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that if thal police again blazes him his oath — he suddenly turned around, thinking Lord Ruthvon was near him, but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had bearded the whole, arid thought that this will build a back from her disorder, cancer, and Miss Avbreys sorcerer, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, and begged them to delay, but for a day. They, attributing this to infallibility, imagined a child taking possession of the spirit of his, tried to pacify him, and critic.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning back room, and he had refused all the others. When he heard of Aubreys evil, he understood it well; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his arid exultation could hardly be concealed from those whom he had acquired this information. He rushed to the house of his former friend, arid, by constant alternance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubrey's car. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to tell — could speak of itself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the crowded path, except with the one to whom he addressed ;— could he know how, if he knew her, her existence, had become worthy of preservation, if he was simply able to listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or this was the will of destiny, that he gained its effects. The title of the elder branch failing in the end, he worked on an important embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state ), which was to take place the same day, before his deportation for the content.\nAubrey, who was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for pen and paper; they gave him bits; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who were now in the grave, who once buried her in their arms, hindered their hope and the hope of their house, to delay, but for a few hours, this marriage, on which the heaviest curses were denounced. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but, by giving it to his doctor, he thought it would be better to harass MissAubreys in even more by, what he considered, the rovings of a monitor. Night passed without rest to the occupied inactive of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily concoive than described, the noles of the body preparation. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiosity of the servants finally overcome their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the dizziness of an old woman powerless. He sold the occasion, with a tied guy was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all was almost assailed. John Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, rushed him into the room, speechless with fury. Wheri on the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée by day, that your sister just has dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So said, he pushed him to his assistants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Avbrey could no longer withstand the hoists; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a bloodfel, and he was transported to bed. She wasn't a lying sister to bis, who wasn't there when he came in, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The morning was solemnized, and the bride and husband left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey increased; bloodshed induced symptoms of approaching teeth. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had passed, he told in a composite way that the order had perpetuated, he died immediately inflamed.\nThe guard hastened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lard Kevin had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTS OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nLORD BYRON RESIDENCE, ACCOUNT, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose a place of rebut, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN 1812, aboard one of Her Majesty ships, through the Greek Arohlpelago, we place in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and always vegetables to have there, lead many British ships to visit it, both men of war and the merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the ships linked to Smyrria, its bodies nearly repay for the dailion of a voyage. We landed, like usual, at the bottom of the hay, and while the green was used in the water, and the bargcl-\nIn order to buy cattle with the rituals, the clergy and myself took a ramble at Homer's school scattered with caves, arid other places, a shoro that we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a mound small so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the field four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to marry. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The cottage over the hill, facing the river, bolongs to hlm, arid he has left an old man in charge of it: he gave Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about four months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening to the home where our compatriot had residod. An old man kindly welcomed us and led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious enclosed closet. They only fell asleep: green walls, marble tohles on each side, a large myrtle in the centro, and a small fountain below, which could be played through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall of Tbe stood a half-dozon in English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor individual painting. The bedroom had only one large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and one pillow – the corn bed to traversoul Greee. In the sitting part, we obsessed a recss of marble. Once, the old husband told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a seaman l arge in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves in the examination of the contents. On the tab, the works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Bolleau and Rousseau are finished; the Rulns of Empires of Volney; Zimmcrman, in Thc Germari; the Messiah of Klapstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Periodise Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, launched in Parma in 1980; several small brochures of the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with paper spirit sheets, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The Lord had the 6th reading of these books the union before he greeted, and forgot to wash them with the others; but, he said, they must be there until his turn; for he is so partial, that if I move a thing without command, he would frown on me for a week together; he just always was very good. I did him a favor once; and I had the product of this farm sor the lroublo to take care of him, with the exception of the zechins of the twerity which I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a dwelling house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for what reason .\"\nThe appearance of the external house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long over fourteen broads, and the marble pilars flew with black plinths and frel work cornice (as it is now a customary in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the tobe roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balustrade, was robbed by a carpet of fir turkey, under an awning of strong caarse linen. Most roofs are furnished with buses, as on them, the Greeks pass their evenings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", fruits of eating, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the hare on the left, as we were erecting the house, a stream of 1 slide, grapes, orangos and lime gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seal with an ornamonal back of wood was placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and laughs until twelve o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to his sons. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and he always attended our church twice a week, Sundays .\"\nThe point of view of this spot was what could be terrified of \"bird-eye view .\" A line of rich valleys leads the eyc to Mount Calcla, covered with flowering alive and myrtle trees, and on top bones that a Greek temple of anticierit enclaved iri majestic rot. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain of Tbe. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon without shadow by a single cloud, ended the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, the small severol islands were distinctly observed, studding the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a more view that I did; but our questions were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had given in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominjck, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could hang on, but I am sure he won ,\" and you can go away, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I scam ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armerian, but on our turn to the citywc learned the several details of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave to a man, horses, others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live with these items. He also bought a new boot for a fisbermari. He had lost himself in a scoundrel, and he often gave Greek treatment to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all we collected, to have was a very eccentric and sensitive ohoracter. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage that is not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen waking up on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a strong piano, and had taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Milylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing about this ramblar in Greececoveld being. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy of disposition, and all these eccentricities that inark peculiar geriius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the Iarid island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mjtylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calclos reclus on every page. Did we regret that we were not curious about our research at the cottage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylene some future day; but to me that much will never come back. I make this spread, because he is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice in the good name of his secretary, which was grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable disposition, averfe to associate with human nature, or contribute in any way to something they sorrows, or add to its pleasures. The fact is directly reverence, as can be clearly collected from these little anecdotes. All the most refined sentiments of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, some love have their seat in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that imprisons him far from a beige upon which Religlon sealed the arter, and the over whose head Benevolere threw his coat. No man can read the foregoing pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countryman. With respect for his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports are always received with caution, especially when the against has unleashed the moral integrity of a man; and the one who justifies himself before this horrible court where all the most appear, only can censor the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest of the disadvantages of a vigorous heart and a self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Courl, Fleet Street.",
    "39": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which his tale is based is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it has not, however, extends itself to the untiI Greeks after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the division of Lcltin and the Greek cburches; at the time, the idea in vogue, that a Lalin body could not corrupulate so buried in their territory, it gradually generated, and formed the subject of a lot of stor wonderful.\nThere are dead people rising from their graves and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful people. Iri the West, it spread, with a slight variation, in all Hungary, Poland, Austria, and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that vampyres soaked in harm by some part of the blood of their victims, who became emaciated, lost their strength, and lost fededly dled of con-\nIf the human blood suckers have become fattened, their vows have dissipated to such a state of resupply, so that they have cohabited with the bill to escape from all the passages of their body, and to detach themselves from the pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, if a course, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, which is a station, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magislclets of the esplanade was carried out in a positive and unanimous manner, about five years earlier, that a certain Heydvke, named Arnold Paul, was heard that, at Cclssovia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been torried by a vampire, but had found a way to rid him of evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the army, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from being a hiinself vampyr; for about twenty or thirty days of death and burial of their bis, many people complained of being tormented by bim, and a statement made a waf that people had been deprived of life by high attacks. To avoid other ml of handkerchief, the inbebitants having consulted their Hadogni, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrisin) fresh, and enlirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth tube, nose, arid ears, pure blood and floride. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the adversary appeal. A stake was entirely pushed by Arnold Paul's heart and body, or it was said that he would have shouted terribly as if he had ambushed alive. It was done, they cut off the bis' head, burned his body, and threw the cash into his grave. The meosvros were adopted with the course of those people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would, in turn, become agents on the others who survive them.\nThe universal belief is that a person pursued by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and sucks in its glow.\nChief bailiff.\nThis monstrous rodomonta is linked here, because it seems better to fit to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In the Marian parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for a heinous erime committed well in existence, that the decaf is born only condemned to vampyria, but the cornpeled to confront his infernal irritations only to those beings whom he loved inost while he on earth — those to whom he w hand by ties of kinship and affection. e :— A supposition allowed to in the movie \"Gajaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre did, thy corsus en0m his tomb 6 th rent; then ghafty haunt the place of origin, and shed the blood of all thy race; Tbero of thy daughter, slster, wifo. In the midst of the neighborhood drain the stream of life; yet hate the banquet that must feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, have yet expired, shall know the devil for their sire; As ye cursed, ye cursed tbem, Tby bloometh, or wilteth upon the stem. But whoever for the weak crime must fall, the most youngest ,6 is loved of all, will bless you with the name of a father — This word will wrap Ly beort in flamo! Yet you must follow your task and mark the last tink of his cheek — the last spark of his eyes, and his last glassy look must see Who freezes 0' plus his lifeless blue; then, a cold without Halloween will tear the braids of his island hair, including, in life, a lock when the tender offering of affection has been worn — But now is supported by the memorial of the thiary agony! But with the best blood shall flow; thy lobes of gnashirig, and the lip of thug; thy stalker shall take thy sulten tomb, and Go-ond with Gouls, and Afrits rave, until these in horror shall depart from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the young Arab Oneiza, who is repugnant as having retruct from the grave for the purpose of tormenting him that she loved better during her existence. But this is what one supposes to be lost which ended in the sin of the life of beer, and which was spread throughout the whole tale of a complete type of purity and innocence. The veracius Tournefort gives a long story in travel bis of surprising several cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calinet, in hift great work on this subject, besides a variety of clecdotos, and tradilionary accounts illustrates his effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classical error, as well as barbari.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, neossay dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simply pointing out that tangbbe term compare is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with lt, makes use in different parts of the world: like Vroueolocha, Vardoulacba, Goul, Broucocol, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared to various parties of the town, more remarkable for his sirigularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror of the abroad, as if he could not participate in the Internet. Apparently, Tbe Fairs light laughter only entered his attention, so that he could by a lack choke him, and strengthen the fear in the breasts where carelessness gnawed. Those who felt this feeling of admiration could not explain from where he arose: some attrigued him to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, seemed to perish, set on a glean to pierce through the inner works of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a lead reed weighing on the skin that he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to too much dung; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom was happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention n. In spite of the deadly tint of her face, whincb never gained a warmer tint, either of the blush of modesty, or of the strong emotion of passion, the form and outlino were beautiful, many female hunters after trying to be noticed, arid gain, at least some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who was mocked by all the monsters in the drawing rooms since the hcr marriage, threw hersolf into her way, and did everything but put on the drcs of a montcbank, to attract her riot :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that they were deceived ;— even her inappalled impudence was flouted, and she left the field. But common adultery could not influence the direction of his eyes, it was the riot that the female sex was indisferent to him; but this was the apparent prudence with which he addressed the virtuous wife and the incorrupt daughter, that few knew that he was ever speaking to breasts. However, he had the reputation of a winning tongue; and that it was that even he overcame the fear of his singular character, ar that they were moved by his apparent hatred of vice, he was like many among those femiles who boast of sex their domestic virtues, as ainong the who wished him by their vices.\nA 6 at the same time, a young gentleman by the name of Aubrey came to London: he was arphan left with an ordinary sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died while both were in the carnage. Left to himself by the Canadians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the more important burden of his mind to the care of the simple suballerns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. That is how he picks up this romantic high prize of honor and frankness, and he ruins every day, so many fears of millions. He believed everything about tosympathy with the virus.\nue, and thought that the vice was lhrown in by Providence only for the images above effect of the scene, aswo see inromances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply consisted in the vefting of clothes, which were also hot, but which were better suited to painting-\nThe eye of r by irregular lheir folds and patches of various colors. Much thought, at the end of the day, that dreams were the realities of life. He is crazy, frank and rich; for these reasons, when he enters gay circles, many mothers surround him, trying to endure with the least truth, their languishing or snoring favourites: the donuts at the time of the sarne, by their frantic faces which he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soon led him to false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snob, there was no soundation in real life for the only of these congres of pleasant pictures and descriptions controlled into these volumes, of which he had formed bis sludy. Finding, however, a certain compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up the high dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, squatted him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other strings of his observation of the exlerian objects, then the tacjt accorded to their existence, implicitly by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his property with extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object in the hcro of a romance, and determined to observe the osfspring of his fantasy, rather than to assimilate it. He has known become a bim bim, has paid attention to him, and so far raised his notice, that his presence has always been recognized. Little by little, he realized that Lord Ruthuen's affairs were darkened, and that he soon discovered, on the street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of getting some information about this singular character, which, until now, had only wetted his curiosity, hehinted to his guardians, that it was chime for him to perform the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the career of vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as so fill of these skios, which scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degrec of competence in corry lhem sur. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive a proposal from him to join her. Flattened by such a black bone of him, which, apparently, had nothing in common with other men, he readily completed it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthvon, and now he has found that, although many more also actors have opposed his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions from the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was profuse in his liberality ;— the id love, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate need. Bvt Aubrey could not avoid pointing out that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indigenc by the misfortunes that accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were sent out of door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his wants, bvt to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to Sirik even deeper in in iniquity hjs, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him to the greater imporlunity of the vicious, which generally outweighs the retirement of the various iridigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of her Lordship, which was more impressed on her mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was a cure on her, because they were all led to the scaffold, or sunk to the lowest and greatest misery. In Brussels and other cities that they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the appearance of whipping his companion to look for the centers of all the fashion vices; there he put himself in all the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always played with ardour, except where the known shcler was antagonistic of hjs, and then he lost even more than he won; but it was still the same unchangeable fao, which that he generally watched society cling up: he was not, however, therefore, when he met the young novice eruption, or the father without chance of a large family; then his law of much coveted fashion — this seemingly abstract mirid was apart, and his eyes sparked with more fire than that of the cal whllst with the half-dead mouse. In the towri, he left the old influent youth, torn from the adorned hc oar, cursed, in the tho beevde of a dung, the bad that spell drew him to the reach of this friend; that many a father sat frantic, in the midst of the word looks of mute hungry children, with at least one sarthing of his 1st immense wealth, where with even buying enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he took no money from the gobbling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, then lclst florin he had just pulled himself out of the conulsive apprehension of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, Japanese 0s comboting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrecy often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this little pleasure which proved the ruin of hell, and did not profit his owl ;— let him be delayed — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain contribution to speak frankly and openly at home; a rainbow, this laugher happened. Lard Ruthveri in his car, and in the middle of tbe various wild and right scenes af nature, was always tho even: hissey speechless as his lip; arid thought Aubrey was near the objoct of his curiosity, heo 6 has not groater gra atification of him that the canonical excitement of wanting vainly to break this inyster, which at his exa lity magination began to take on the appearance of something fupernoural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey saw his companion for a while; he left him sitting daily in the morning of about a Countess of Italy, while he went into the church of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was thus ingested, letters came from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, breathing only from affection; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonished bim; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in his companion, the woman seemed to give sufficient reason for the bim-\nef. His guards insisted that he left his friend immeasurably, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, for the possession of irresistible powers, destructive bones, made his moro licentious habits dangerous to society. It had been discovered that if contempt for adultery had not given rise to hot jn of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to improve his gralification, that his victim, the associate of his vilt, be hurt from the pinnacle of vnsueed virtue, down from the abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the women whom they had sought, apparently because of virtue jr, had, from his dot, even thrown the mask, and had not rescued to expose all the desolation of their vices to the public gaze.\nEvery determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shined a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He breathed himself to invent an enslaved pretext to abandon him completely, in order, in the sense, to monitor him more closely, and not to let him pass any light circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon perceived, that his secretary was striving to work on the experience of the daughter of the lady who the house he mainly frequented. Iri Italy, if rarely a married woman is interested in society; so he was forced to pursue his plans in secret; but Aubreys cye followed him in all his windings, and quickly discovered that an assignment had picked up, which would most likely end the ruin of an innocent girl, though not bought. With no time lost, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked her for her intentions towards the lady, informing her at the same time that he knew that he was about to meet her. Lord Rutbvenans answered that his intentions were such as he thought all would have on such an occasion; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry her, rit meroly ed. Aubrey retired; arid, impudently impeding a note, to say that from that moment he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to ruin other apartments, and by attacking the mother of the lady, he gave him all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. The signature was prevented. Lord Ruthven then did simply send his sergeant to notify his full assertion to a separator; a bull did not suggest that he had no doubt about his plans having been thwarted by the Aubricks interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, he quickly found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soan took care of himself by tracing the erased records of ancient glorious monuments which apparently, as a result, became more and more fragile.\nampd to chronicle the acts of free men only before the leaves, had hidden beneath the sheltering ground or many coveted clothes. Undor the same razor as himself, existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to protect the promise of the faithful in Mclhomets Paradif, except that his eyes spoke a lot of sorany spirit one to think that it could belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plclin, or stumbled along the mountain idea, one would have had a bad type of her beauties; for whom I had exchanged his eye, the eye of the animated nature appeared, for this luxurious look sleepy or animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe has often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and osten said the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of cl Kashm, are buttorfly, shaw all the beauty of his form, sloating as he was on the wind, with the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on an almost effaced tablet, in the contribution of his sylpha-like place. Hence, the fall of her braids, while she wilted around her, the inhibition of the oxen in the ray of the sun, so delicately brilliantly brilliantly and faded from the hues, this might well excuse the forget-\nthe fulries of antiquarian table, which let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance to the true interpretation of a passage in the Pavsanias. But why try to describe the charm that everyone feels, but once can appreciate ?— It was innocent, young, and beauty, without being affected by overcrowded drawing roots and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his suture hours, she stood up, and looked at the magical effects of his pencil, intra cing the scenes of his place of origin; she would then describe him the circular dance on the open plain, painted to him in all that shines the colour of youthful mernory, the pomp of marriage that she remembered having seen in her childhood; then, turning to objects who had obviously made a greater impression on his mind, threw to him all the supernatural tales of the nurse bear. And often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by pretending on the leprosy of a beautiful woman to prolocate her existence for the months that followed, her cold blood would, while he tried to laugh his soul of these idle and horrible fantasies; but Iaritho quoted her the names of old men, who had finally detected one living among them, aster feeral of their relatives relativos and children had been found marked with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when sho mad and hiin so incredulaus, fbe banged of him to believe it, for he had been, rernarked, that those who dared question their existence, had always had a proof, which forced them, with pain and beauty, to confess himself true. She gave bim details of the traditional appearance of these same monsters, and her horror is magnified, haunting a rather accurate description of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on porsuring it, that there could be no truth in his fears, although at the same time he gained at the same time, many coincidences that had all tended to excite the belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to attach him more and more to Ianthe; ber innocence, so contrasted in mind all the emotional virtues of the women among what he had sought for his vision of romance, wan his heart; and while he ridiculed the idea of a young English habit man, marrying a daughter unducated Groek, he was even more and renouned alta-\nHe was attached to the fairy of the almost. He would sometimes tear himself from her, and, forming a plan for some resear of antiquclrian, he would make a room, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found that it was impossible to steal his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he kept a image that seemed to be alone the possessor right of his thoughts. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always managed to separate from him with reductance; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy in the sketching or uncovoring some fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. It had applied to my parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with the present several, affirmed their existence, the pale of horror to the narna itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to follow his excursions, which had to be the captain for a few hours; when they heard the narration of the place, they immediately led not to return at all times, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek world will ever remain, after the day has closed, to any confidancy. They described it as a variety of vampires in their noctumal origins, and they solved the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey made the light of the representations of these, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, whose narne even apparently made their blood freeze, he stood silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his excursion without being coupled; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief in these horrible fools, had inspired them such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came next to his horse, and hastened him seriously to return, the night passed by allowed these beings to be pulsed in action ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy with his research, that he made a peroeive riot that day-light was about to end, and that in the horizori there is one of those spots that, in the warmer climates, so quickly gather in a trenendaus inass, and pour all the rage over the devoted country .— He finally mounted his horde, however, determined to make up by speed for his delay: but it was too late. The twilight, in the climates of the south of the island, is more than unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: He had advanced very far, the power of the storm was above – his shears had a little rest interval – his heavy rain forced his way through the canopy fog, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse was scared, and he was carried with extreme speed into the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and it marked, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hovel which hardly rose vp from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide him to the city, or at least trust in the shelter of the basin storm. As he approached, the thvnders, for an inamont silerit, let him hear the horrific shrjeksos cl femme mirigling with the stifled, exulting mookery of cl laughter, conlinued in an almost intact sound ;—ho was stunned: but, awakened by the thunder which rolled again on his head, he, an effort suddenly, forced the door of the hut. He found himself in deep darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently unaware of it; for, they call it, they felt the contiriated sounds, and they gave him an opinion of no. He found himself in contact with an ori, which he immediately grasped; a voice cried out :\" Agari floundered! \", to which he succeeded a great laugh; and he felt heralds afflicted by him whose strength seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he fought; but it was in vain: he was lifted with his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on a bin, and knelt in his chest, had put his hands kissed on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrating through the hole that gavo light in the day, disturbed him ;— rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in a moment the crash of the branches, as he was breaking the timber, was no longer heard. The storm was not of size; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those who were not. They entered, the slug of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the stubble loaded on each straw individual with heavy foot flakes. In the desire of Aubrey, they sought her, the one who had drawn her to her cry; he was in darkness; but what was her pride, when the light of tears burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a cross without life. He looked, hoping that there would be only one version resulting from his disturbed imagination; but he saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by this side. There was a color born on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost as touching as the wife who used to live there :— on the neck bear and the breast was happy, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men punched, wept, simultaneously 1 hit with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter box quickly formed, and Aubroy was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so many shiny and saris mink, now flanked by the flower of life that had dyed him. He did not know what his purchases were — his mind was eaten up and seemed to run away from reflection, the clerk took refuge in ease — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They soon met by different parts that they were engaged in searching for her that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as the city approached, announced the parents of some dreadsul catostrophs. \" To describe the mourning of their child would be impossible; but when they saw the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the lacorse. They were inconso....\nMale; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to the bed will sejzed with a most violent and often delirious fender; in these intervals he called Lord Ruthveri and on Ianthe—by an unusable combination, he seemed to be begging an old companion to spare the being he loved. In October Tyres, he permeates the evils on his head, and the cursed destroyer of beer. Lord Ruthveri, had the opportunity at that time to arrive at the ns, and, of the water motif, wearing the style of Aubrey, immediately put herself in the same house, and became his constant companion. When the latter began to pull off his delirium, he was horrified and astonished by the sight of the one who had an image that he had now combined with that of a vampire; but LordRuthven, by his kirid words, involved almost the deafening repentance of the fault that had caused their separation, and still grieved by the attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seems to have changed; it no longer appeared that the apathetio being wba had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon his convalescence began to be rclpid, he agaln groudally removed in the same state of mind, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his fixed gazec iritcntly upan hlm, with cl smile of malicious oxultation playing at the top of his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted a bit. During the last period of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in scrambling the progress of these orbs, turning, like the over the world, the motionless sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was weakened by muoh, and this spirit elasticity which had once so distinguished it now seemed to him to have fled forever. Today he was as lovers of solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as much as he desired,\ndc, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he was looking for him in the midst of the ruins who had previously squandered, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side — if he fought him in the wads, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly turned, bow, to his wild iinagination, his face pae and his throat wounded, with a sweet smile on his Iips. He decided to steal the scenes, whose excessive characteristic created bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had asked him to take care of the hive tenderly during his illness, that they should not attack those parts of Greece and that they had not yet had a quarrel. They went in all directions, and looked for all the places that were attached to a memory; but, although they had flouted from the room in the place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard a lot of rohbers, both gradually began to diminish these relationships, which imagined they were only the invention of individuals, whose interest it was to arouse the generosity of those that they defended against the supposed dangers. As a result, they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as mentors than to defend them. Upon entering, however, a narrow defilc, at the bottom of which was hed bone a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the precipices of the area, they heard the reason to repented their negligence; for hardly the whole part engaged in the pass of riarrow, when they were surprised by the whistling of clofe bullets at the head of their, and by the ratio echoed from several cannons. In an accident, their guards had left them, and by placing the lhomsolves towards the rocks of behind, had begun to fire in the direction from which the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubroy, imitating the example, withdrew for an inescapable behind the saddle tower of the defilement: but shameful six-year-old thus held by the enemy, who with insulting shouts made they advanced, and being exposed to the insistence sloughter, if one of the thieves should rise above and take them at the back, they decided both to rush into the fear of the economy. Hardly, they had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthuen gave a bullet back into his shoulder, which brought him to the earth. Aubrey was quick to attend; and, being no longer at his own peril, he was quickly surprised by the figures of the robbers around him, his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately thrown their arrns and surrerided.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon prompted them to transmit his friend your wounded cabin a neighbor; and having accepted upon a ransom, not to be more troubled by their presence — they are simply to keep the entrance until the surface should return to the spirit of the promised svm, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Rulhven grew rapidly; in two days mortification followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed like a conscious of pain if he had been out there; but towards the elove of the last evening, the bocam spirit apparently bad, and his eye often fixed on Auhrey, who was trained to help with more ordinary than eamestness —\"Affect me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I don't mean my life, I pay attention to the death of my existence as little as the death of the passing day; but you can miss my honor, your friend. \"\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \" I cried but a little — my life ebbs Japanese — I cannot explain everything — but if you hid everything you know about me, my honor was free of stain in the mouth of the world — and my death has been unknown for some time in England — Ivt lift. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising him. \"If with exulent violence, swear by all your soul, by all your nature, by fear, swear that for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes and my death to any living being on the way, whatever you may see. \" His eyes were inflamed with their socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he sank on his pillow, and he did not breathe more.\nAubrey retired, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his mind, hc did not know why; when one remembered his oath, a cold shiver came upon him, as if, from the president of the thc, something horrible invaded him. In the morning, he was about to enter the hover in which he had left, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer thor, after having been oonveyed by himself arid cornades, at his retreat, at the pinnaccle of a nearby mountain, according to a promise which they had given to his secretary, that he would be exposed to the first old ray of the moon which rose after his death. At the stonishod, and taking several of the men, determined to bury him to the place where he was. But when he went up to the sum, he had no trace of the corpse or clothes, the thieves swore that they would poach on the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was puzzled in conjectures, when he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of the clothes.\nWeary of an country girl that he had met with such terrible evildoers, and in which all apparently conspired to the height of this superstitious melancholy which had grasped his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to transmit it to Otranto or Naples, he occupied it to organize the efforts he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthen. Among other things, there is a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and atagbans. When turning them, and examining the curious forms, what was his surprise to sin a shock apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discavé in the fatal hut — he fuddered — hastening to gain surther proos, he sounds the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he mounted, especially shaped, to gain that he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need for a stealthy certainty: they seemed to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particulate form, the same different shades on the hast and sheath were all in the peeling on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way back to Rome, his first inquiries were about the lady he had empty for Lord Ruthven seductelve arls' snatch. Hor parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and it had not been heard since the departure of his secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he feared that this lady might have a victim at the Santa destroyer. He bees morose and silent; and bis only the occupation can by exhorting the speed of the poftilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon made his way on the Eriglattres coasts; and he clung to the typhoon of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the erbraces and the claws, in his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, through her insantine ears, she had gained her effect, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have this winning grace that wins in front of and applause from the salon's bonesemblies. There were none of these elements that exist in the heated atmosphere of an overcrowded apartment. His blue eye was illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about this which did not seem to arise from misfortune, but from a little refreshing thing, which seemed to indicate to you a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step wasn't that light foot, which strays where to a butlorfly or a color must attract – it was sedative and pensive. When alone, her face was never illuminated by a smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and forgot in her presence, those deed that she knew how to destroy her rest, what exchanged her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, which Fao, were then used in the height of their home sphere work. She was still only twenty, and had had the 6th riot in presbytery to the world. He had been thought by his guardians more fit than his presentation if he delayed until the return of his brother from the continent, when he could be his protector. It was now, in fact, resolved that the next salon, which approached the most, should be the evocation of its entry into the \"busy window\". Auhrey would rathor move into the house of the fathers, and fed on the melancholy that defeated him. He could not feel interested in the frivolity of fashionable strangers, when his mind had become so strange by the events he had seen; could be determined to shock his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a living room.\nThe crowd was in excess.\nive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to bass in a kingly smile, hastened the titber. Aubrey was there with her sister. While standing in a corner by himself, without taking into account all around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in that same place—he suddenly felt selected by his arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, saved in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a specter that would blaspheme him, when he perceived, at a distance, the same figure who had attracted his notico on the spot this on his first entry into society. He gagged until his members almost refused to endure their misfortune, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was a trained coach. He rushed into the room with pressed steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid. his thoughts burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances fainted in a terrible picture — the dagger — his cloth. — He woke up, which could not make it possible — the dead were resurrected again !— He thought his imagination had only given him the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he decided to ask the concert running Lord Ruthven, the name hung on the lips of his, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He later left with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Living under the protection of a matron, he retreated into a corner, and the move babed himself to his own eaters. Perceiving, finally, which many were leaving, he awakened from the suns, and entering another room, found his sister encircled by Sovereign, in full conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, who one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him the most abhorrent features. And he went forth, and took the bow of his sister, and with a whip he forced her toward the street; and at the door he snuck himself, preventing the multitude of servants who were waiting for the Lords; and while he was committed to passing them, he heard again the voice of the thal murmuring near Bim —\"Remember your oath !\"— He did not turn, but, pressing with his fist, he reached the house.\nAubrey has become almost dissociated. Is before his mind being absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was rosy enough, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged her to explain what had caused her stubborn conduct. He only has a few words, and these terrified him. The more he laughed, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to roar, bearing driving over his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and did he not have his progress? His sister could be touched by him. But even if he had to break his oath and reveal his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought of using using his own hand to free the world from such a wretched o; 6th dead, he remembers, had already been burned. For days, he remained in this state; shook in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, wbo, with his eyes being dumped, begged Him, for his good, to sustain nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry stills and loneliness, he loft helps home, r ooded of street to the street, arixiouf to steal this image that haunted him. His robe bewitched the rights, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midday darnps. He was in the room longer to be recognized; at first he returned with the evening at home; but at last he helped him to rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sister, anxious for his safety, used stones to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that he left behind by his abscondence of all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society, and to watch him closely, anxious of forowarn, in a smear of oath of hell, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But if one entered a reed, that his discontented eyes and discontented eyes were so striking, that his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeing, for his own good, a society that touched HLM so strongly. However, when the comprehension proved to be unwavering, the guards thought it was good to instil, and when they laid down that his mind was alienated, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had been imposed on them previously by the Aubreys firewall.\nThat is right.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and sufferings which he had daily counted in his wanderings, locked up to prevent him from putting to the general eye those marks of what they considered to be madness, they set up a doctor to reside in his house, and take constantly looked after him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by terrible suffering. His incoherence became so great that the hot house was limited to the big room. He was often lying there for days, inconvenient with being rude. He had become emaciated, his eyes had drawn a glassy lust ;— the only sign of arid recollecion reappearing arid affection appeared on the entrance to his sister's place; then he started somolims, and, grabbing his hands, with eyes that savourily affected him, he might have wished that she would not touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love is far from me, don't come near him !\" However, when she asked whom he was speaking to me, the only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And again, he sinks into a state, from where she could even wake him up. But gradually, as the year passed, his incoherenesis became less frequent, and his spirit threw a portion of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day, he came on his fingers bis a certain number, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed out, when, on the last day of the year, an af children entering his room, began to covet with his doctor upon the circumstratory melancholy of Aubreyf being in such a terrible situation, that his sister would not day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked for anxiety to whom. Happy with his mark of return to the intersection, of which they felt that he had been deprived, they mentioned the dwarf of the Count of Mclrsden. Thinking that he was a young country who had been met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished even more by the expression of his intention to be present at the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't take it, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He swollen once again, able to capture the influence of his pretty smile, because he shook his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the end of his brother's life with affection. He started talking with all his wonned earth, arid to concentrate on his marriage with a person so distinguished row. for and each accomplished; when he suddenly perceived a lock on his chest ;0 Pening her, which was his surprise to the heissing which characteristics of the wood hod monster, so long influenced his life. It selects portraits in a paroxysm of rage, and trampled under the feet. On her asking for why he thus destroyed the resuscitation of her runaway husband, he looked at how he was being rioted to understand her—then grasping her hands, and looking on beer with a srantic expression of face, which his sweatr that she would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not move forward — it seemed that this way would tell him to remember his oath—he suddenly televised, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the Canadians and physicists, who had heard all of it, and bought that it was a return of its disorder, entered, and waited for it from Miss Aubrey, desired it to leave him. He fell on his knees to them, implored, begged for them, but for a day. They attributing this to madness they Irnagined had taken possession of his spirit, advanced to pacify him, arid rot.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the living room, and had been repressed with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he easily understood it as a causo; but when he learned that he was crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly hide those among whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to go to the mouth of his former companion, and, by a tough attitude, and by the claim of a great caramel...\nHe gradually gained Miss Aubrey ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labor to record....\ncould speak of himself of an individual having no sympathy with any being overcrowded with earth, sick with her to whom he addressed him ;— could say to her, since he knew her, her existence, seemed vain to seem worthy of presentation, if it was simply that he could bind himself to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew that we knew how to use the art of the serpent, or that was the will of destiny, that he was spoiling his affections. The title of the branoh elder fell to him at length, he obtained a large embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's strange structure ), which was to take place on the day very before his department for the other.\nAubrey, when he was left by the physiclan and his guardians, attempted the corruption of the servants, but in the rain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sisler, the conjuring, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, on the honor of those now in the tomb, which once held her arms as their hope and the boop of their house, to delay bvt for a few hours this morrioge, on which he denounced the heaviest cursos. The servants would deliver it; but give it to the physicist, he thought it was a riot to kick to harass any more the mind of Mifs Aubrey by, what he considered, the greasing of a maniac. The night spent the rest of without the occupied prisoners of the house of Tbe; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could easily be sprayed than described, the notes of busy preparation. The morning room, and the lard of the pickles burst his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually stole away, leaving him in the custody of an old woman without shame. Hc said the opportunity, if a bourid was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all the personnel were assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking arrogantly, rushed him out of the room, without a voice in the fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee by the day, that I have dishonored your sister. Women are fragile !\" So, he said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, came unsure in search of him. Aubrey could no longer stand; this rage not finding the treatment, had broken a vessel of blood, and he was thrown into bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the physicist was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the sixth marriage and the husband left London.\nAbbrey weakness increased; blood effvsjori produced symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's grandparents to be called, and when the hour of midnight a child struck, he returned what the reader persisted, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey, but when they arrived, it was too much. Lord Ruthveri had spoken, and Aubrey sister struggled for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, let him choose his place of rest, and proof his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greciari Archipelago, on board the arrival of Her Majesty's ships, in the year 1812, we spent in the honor of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, lead many Ritish B ships to visit it, warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for the hips related to Smyrna, its premiums ampirepay for the deviation of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were wearing watering clothes, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with nations, the clergy. and I took a ramble in the cave called Homers School, and other places, which we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small monument so named) we met and hired a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with the English lord, who left the Islamic days for proviaus to our arrival in his felucca. \"He made me look like a pilat,\" said Steve Greek ,\" and he took me to look for him; but I did not choose to leave Mityleno, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winegrower, six zechins grouped for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), arid resolved there about fifteen months, but not constancy; for he sails in his field very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis story aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time hastening at home where the very countryman had given in. An old man, who led us over the mansion, welcomed us. It consisted of sour apartments on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a bathroom, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet attached. They were all simply decorated: green wooden walls, marble lables on the other side, a large bluertle in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small broriz Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood a dazen, English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress extended or the floor, with two plush cotton quills around a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Unfortunately, the old man told us, stuffed with books and papers, which were in the chest of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Russia, the Ruins of the Empires of Volney, Zimmerman, in German, the Messiah of Klopstock, the novels of Katzehue, Schillerf play of Robbors, Milton Paradise Lost, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphiets of the Greek press in Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Italian. The Messiah was literally scratched all over, and marked with sheets of paper, which were also remarks.\nThe old man said :\"The Lord had read these books in the evening, he sailed, and fargot to place them with the others; but,\" he said ,\" They must lie there until his return; for it is so special that if I move something without order, he would frown me for a week together; h ls others very well. I have done him a favor once; and I have the prefect of the farm if he has trouble taking care of him, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small hill in the wood, and whom the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for which reason .\"\nThe appearance of the outer nozzle was plentiful. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and bitter wide, and the flutcd marble pillars with black plinths and frel work cornices (as it is now usual in the Greek architecture ), were considered by a higher roof of tcln tube. The roof, surrounded by a light stone balcony, was surrounded by a beautiful carpot of Turkoy, beneath an awning of coarse linen strong. The most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, like \"lachryma Christmas\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening twilight.\nOn the left, you enter the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shade of two bushes large myrtlo, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we are told, the lord spent many of his evenings of arid nights up to twelve clocks, reding, writing, and speaking to herself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always frequented our choice twice a week, flouting on Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what can be called \"a bird view\". A flax of rich vineyards on the ycto Mont Calcla, in full bloom of olives and myrtle, and on the top of the which The Greek temple appeared in a majestic decay. A small current is found from the tourists that descend into broken collapses, until it is the last in the world near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea class glass, and a horizon not eclipsed by a single oloud, finishes the view in front; and a little on the left, through a view of high hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations are not like the dwarf of the person who had resided in this kingneant solitude: no one knew his name but Doininick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" Could he tell me ,\"but I sure he won't do it,\" and can you say it, an old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't do it .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned the febrile peculiarity of the isolated lard. He shared the eyes of young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with them at the nuptial feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by wearing these articles. He bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave G Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, he seemed to have been very eccentric and fully from all that we have collected. A circumstance that we are looking at, which our old friend at college thought he should not reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought a piano-forlc, and taught him the use of it himself.\nThis was the information with which we got away from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination will be on the rack, guessing what this rambler in Greece could be. He was grieved, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of disposiliation, and there were all these ecclesiaries that marked a particular group. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect, student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he said, about that you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also saw him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the family of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the recluse of Calcla on the every page. Did we regret not having been a curious moro in our research at the costlage, but we comforted ourselves with the idea of returning to Mitylerie one day; but that day's neuer retum. I make this statement, believing that it is not a disinteresting one, and that it is the good name of his secretary, which has been seriously gloomy. It has been described as an ari insensitive provision, contrary to the assistant with the human nature, or cooperating in any way to appease his punishments, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the reverse, as can be clearly collected from these small amounts. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of the secretary, seem to have the seat in his bosam. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness, the rest of solitude, is an additional reason to mark the thing as a being on the heart, because Religjon has put his seal, and on which the hand Benevolence has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a countrymari. In resembling his love or pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Caution must be exercised, especially when it comes to undermining the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible criminal where everything must appear, only can censor the errors of another death. Lord Byron's character, if you want his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-taught consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "40": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstitlation on which this tale is founded is a very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of Christianity; and it only ensured its present form since the division of the Latin churches and Greece; at that time, the dominant bceome idea, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in the territory of their, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful ftories, still existing, of the dead rising from their graves, and nourishing on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Avstria and Lorraine, where belief existed, the vampyres soaked a certain part of the blood of uictims thoir, the wbo emacillized, lost their strength, died quickly of consumption; while these hainan blood suckers were fattening — and their brain veins dissolve to such a slate of repletion, to cause the blood to flow from all the passage of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the Journal of London, on March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible habit of a particular case of sympathy, what is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. Itoppeors, that after a examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates at the plae, they affirmed positively and unanimously, that about five years earlier, an oertaln Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had been a hero to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Scriva, hc had seen 6 tormented by a vampy, bvt had had a way to get rid of the evil, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampy, rubbing with bis blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampy himself; for twenty or ten days after his death and burial, many people complained of having been tarred by, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent other handkerchiefs, the inhahitants consulted their Hadagrii, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in the class of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and throw themselves into the mouth, nose, and ears, pure florid blood cold. The having evidence was therefore obliried, they resorted to the usual remedy. A ftake was trained entirely in through the heart and the body of Arnold Paul, where he would have cried out as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his hoax, burned his body, and threw ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the forces of those who had previously done a vampyrisan, for fear that they would pass away, in their cunning, on others who survived them.\nThe universal heliefis, that a person sucked by a vampyre, becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks at the turn of this.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade, if relayed here, because, seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the current observations than any other instance that could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is a kind of punishment for death, for some heinous children coincided when it existed, that the deceased was not only condemned to vampyria, but that he had decided to limit his infernal visits only to those he loved most while he was dead, those to whom he was bound by bonds of indignation and affection.\nBut first argument, as Vampyre sent him, thy horn shall be torn from the tomb of the Jts; and it shall haunt the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy seed: from thence of thy daughter, sister, wife, about midnight drain the stream of 1 jfe; and Yel shall erod the banquet which performeth shall feed thy livid corsus, thy victims, yet Ere lbey shall expire, know the devil for their sire: as thou cursest thyself, thou cursest them, Your flowers are wilted on the stem. But one of them, for your crime, must be kindled. The young man, who is very attached to me, will follow you with the name of a foetus, and your heart will be kindled. But you must put an end to your task and mark the timidity of his cheek, the last spark of his cye, and the last glassy view that freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the unhalifted hand, will tear the braids of his low hair, including, in life, a lock when the tender offering of Affecti was only disturbing — But now is carried by the Memorial of your agony! But with the best blood of himself will flow; the grinchy tooth, and the lip of the hook; then hunting at the sulten tomb, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until hese in horror departs from the spectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Sauthey also presented in his wild blue beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the prayer course of the young girl of Arclbiari Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting whom that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to come from the sinfulness of life, being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocence. Tbe veracieuse Tournefort gives a long story in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which which claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a valety of anecdotes, and traditional narratives illustrating the effects of it, put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMariy curious and interesting noticos about this singularly horrible superstition could be added; although the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be omitted by merely pointing out that if the torm Vampyre, if one ln most genres I accept, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vrocolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, a nobleman appeared in the parts of the leodores of the town, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. Ho played on the around mirror, also if he could not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the beautiful only attracted her attention, that could be by a glance suffocating her, and throwing fear into the breasts where the thought reigned. Those who felt this sensation of apprehension, could not explain from where he rose: some attached him to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance pierce through the inner works of the heart; bull fell on the cheek with a radius of lead which weighed on the skiri he could not not. His particularity made him be invited to every dung; everyone wanted to see a hirn, arid thase who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now fell the weight of the nun, were happy to have something in the presence of some in a position to engage their attendance. Despite the deadly hue of the face, which has never gained a warmer hue, either from the buffoon of rnodity, or from the strong ossalon emotion, although its shape and line have worn beautiful, many hunters of feminism have tried to gain his attention, and to win, as a matter of fact, some marks of what they might call the affront: Lady Mercor, who had been the mockery of every cannonier in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw hersels into her way, and made all the bvt put on a robe of a Montane bank, to attract her attention :— although in uain :— when she stood before the hive, although her eyes were apparently fixed0ri she, still it seemed that they were inporced ;— even her uriappalled impudenco was bafflcd, and she left the field. But even if common adultery could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, there was such an apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, who sewed knew that he was never speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and whether wcls that itproven overoame fear of his singular character, or that they were moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was like many among the women who form the best of the sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who suily him by their vices.\nAt the same time, a young gentleman from Aubrey's drama came to Landon: he was a ban orp left with only one sister in possession of great riches, by parents who died that he was still in childhood. He was also left to himself by the Canadians, who tangentially tangentially to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the more important charge of the spirit of his attention to the inercenary subbolterns, he cultivated more his imagination than his judginent. He therefore had a sense of honor and high romantic thal frankness, which every day ruined so many apprentices. He all wanted to sympathize with virtue, and thought that vice was the object of Providence more for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we do in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage simply coniferous in the setting of clothes, which were as hot, but that was better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, it well, that the dreams of poets were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, on his inheritance in gay circles, the dying mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the truth, leasl their favourites languisbing or grumpy: the daughter at the time sarne, by their illuminating cauntenances when he objected, and by their sparkling eyes, which he opened his lips, soon led him into lack of the notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the rannance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in the tallow and the sparkling wax candles, born of the presence of a ghost, but of the lack of snoring, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions calined in these volumes, from that he had formed his studies. However, some compensation in his happy vanity, that is about to clinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than tacit assent to their existence, implicitly by the avoldance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine all the things that he floated his propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object as a hero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far put forward his opinion, that his presence has always been recognized. Gradually, he learned that Lord Ruthveri's affairs were embarrassed, and that he soon realized, according to the preparation notes in the letter, that he was low to travel. Desiring to spoil a little bit of informal about this singular character, which, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that he was shooting for to make the tour, that for many generations has been thought necessary to allow the young to lactate a few quick fleps in the career of vice-lowards putting on quality with the elderly, and only allowing them to appear as if fallen from heavens, scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of joke or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to wear them. They consented: Arid Authority immediately evoking his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the circle water.\nSo far, Avbrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthvens choracter, and now he has found that, taking many more of his actions has been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different consolusiori of the apparent motives for his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— idleness, vagaband, and beggar, received from his hand only enough to relieve immendiatical desires. But Aubrey could not avoid the marking, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the evildoers who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alms ;— these were sent out of the door with repressed sneezes; but when the profligate came to ask sorority, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his ergot, or to sink him even deeper into his inquilt, he was far from rich charity. However, he moved it to the importunity of the victims' importunity, which generally prevailed over the retirement of the virtuoso indigent. There was a circumstance about the charity of bis Lordship, which was even more impressed up his mind: all the lhoose upon that it was given, found unwaveringly that there was a curse up, because they all led either to the scasfold, or sunk down and most of the misery of the client. In Brussels and other cities, through the spirit of the Faro table, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought the centers of all the fashionable vices; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always won with success, except where the knowri was his antagonist, and then he lost even more tuna than he won; but it was always with celebrity without changing face, with which one generally looked at society around: it was not, commented, Thus, when he encountered the young novice eruption, or the unlucky father of a large family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of Forturia — this apparent abstraction of mind was set aside, and his eyes sparkled more fire than that of the cat while da lying with the half-dead mouse. In all the cities, he raised the well-off and farmed young people, dormed by the circle which he adorned, cursing, in the soljtude of a dragon, the fato which had drawn him to the reach of this friend; weeping a lot, a father sat frantic, in the midst of the labs talking of mute hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to satisfy their fervoury fervour. Yet he does not look like money from the gambling table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder that he just pulled out of the canuulsive take of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certificate of knowledge, which was rioting, however, able to fight the harassment of the most experienced. Avbrey Osten wanted to represent this to his Frisian, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not take care of his own profit ;— but he did — every day he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity some to speak to him frankly and openly; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification from him than the moving excitement of vairily desire to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost the sight of his companion for a while; he left him in the daily room in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of memorials in another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, the letters arrived from England, which he opened with implacable eoger; the first was his sister, searching for nothing but fencing; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he would sink before entering his thal imagination, there was a bad rosident power in the bis competition, they seemed to be also given a reason sufficient for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately left his friend, and emerged that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irroslstiblo seduction powers made his skilful licentious more dangerous for society. He had been distraught, that his contempt for adultery had not come into being in the halea of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratitude, that his victim, the parlner of bis guilt, filled with the pinriacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degration: in the sinc, that all the women whom he had sought, apparently on the aceton of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not rescued themselves to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose child character has not yet shown a luminous pear finger on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, in the second while, to look at it more closely, he strives not to let pass any slight circumcision by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, and soon received that this Lordship was working on the inexplicence of the lady's daughter. He was dating home. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is inet with in society; so he was forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubricky eye followed him in his windings, and soon discovered that an assigration had been applied, which would probably end in the rule of an innocent girl, though insensitive. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and hardly asked him for his intentions with regard to the lody, informing a bim at the same time that he was aware of his inclination to be on that night. Lord Ruthven replied: tell his internions were such that he assumed that everything was going to throw itself on such a reunion; and after being in a hurry if he wanted to marry him, he was content with laughing. Aubrey retired; and, tirelessly writing a note, to say, that from this morning. which must docline accompany his Lordship in the rest of their proposed visit, he ordered his servant to seek other apartmerits, arid calling on the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The subpoena has been proved. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to warn his camplet of a separation; but he did not mention any suspicion as to his plans of having was defiled by the intersection of Aubrey.\nHav ing 1ft Rome, Aubrey led his march towards Greece, crossing the Peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of himself by drawing the records faded of clincific glory on the monuments that apparently, afhomed of chronicling these acts of freemen only before slaves, had hidden them under the floor holtering or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as himself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a pagan.\nneither wisbing to purlray on canvases the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for any order to think that it might belong to those who had rio souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought that the gazel 1 was a bad type of her beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the animated nature eycof, for this luxurious look sleopy of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, origated in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, fhow the beauty wholo of its form, floating cls it was on the wind, with a greedy look of blm, who forgot the letters which had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the conclusion of his figure of sylph. Often, stress falls, while flattering around, exhibiting the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, it is necessary to excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object that he evil before aspires to the vital importance of the proper interprelation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms all the feelings, but none can appreciate ?— It was innocence, youth, and beauty, disused by crowded drawing rooms and stifling balls. As he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood there, and looked at the magical effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the circular dance on open peain tube, painted, to him in the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered having seen in childhood; and then, turning to subjects which, obviously, had made a greater impression on his mind, bim bim all the surrituural talks of his laugh. She often told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her friends, and the clrest bonds, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a pretty feole to prolong its existence for the months that followed, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh horde of this life and horrific fantasies; but Ianthe quoted the names of old men, who had both detected one living among them, after their close relatives and their children had been found marked by the stamp of the friend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelieving, she prayed to him to believe hor, for it had been noticed that lhoose had deaggered their existence, had always had a given proof, which forced them, with pain and heart, to infer. She detailed him the traditional appearance of the Lhesian monsters, and her horror was inoroaved, hearing a fairly exact application from Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could not be the truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered to the multitude coincidances which had all tended to excite a belljef in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey heganto is becoming more and more attached to Iarilhe; his inriocence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the Amoring women that he had sought for his vision of love, when his heart; set in motion as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, still more and more he finds himself more and more attached to the almost magical form of him. He sometimes moved away from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, determined not to return until his ohjecl waf reached cd; but he still found it impossible to fix his attention appropriately lhe rvins around him, where in his mind he retreated on the last image seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Anthony was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had known for the first time. She always seemed to separate herself from him with the reluctarice; but it was a blunder that she had no more than a spirit that she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy sketching or uncovering a fragment that had still overshadowed the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror to his very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to make one of his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, all at once begged not to rot at night, because he necessarily did not support passing through a word, that no Greek would ever remain, after the closing of the day, at any confidence. They described it as the station of the vampires in their night orgies, and unraveled the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their pitch. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to protect them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to make fun of a superior, infernal power, the very name of which apparently made their frozen blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on bjs unattended exoursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and converged version that his words, intimidating the belief of horrible friends, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly begged him to return, and he allowed the power of these beings to be put into action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that journalism could soon end, and that on the lrc horizon was one of those spots which, in the climates of war, so quickly gathered together a mass of tremendovs, and poured all the rage on the devoted country .— He, however, mounted his horse, determined to catch up by the speed sar. I was late: but it was too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and he had advanced fuel, the power of the storm was soothed — his thunders failed had barely a reft interval — his thick rain bewitched through the foliage of the canopy, while the blue lightning bewitched seemed to fall arid radlate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was quickly transported through the entangled forest. Finally, by fatigue, he stopped, and found, by the brilliance of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof that rose up and ruffled the masses of dead lews and bruins that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find one to guide them to the city, or at the confident distance to get shelter from the storm layer. As he approached, the thunders, for a while, silted, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with the suffocating and exulting mockery of laughter, extending in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, to open the door of the hut. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, however, put him in the shadow. He was apparently not perceived, although he dared, the sounds continued, and nothing was noticed by him. He found himself in contact with someone who is immediately seized; when a voice cried out :\" Again mocked !\" to whom a great laugh succeeds; and he felt that he was afflicted by the one whose strength saw superhuman; determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was in uain: he was lifted from his feet and threw with enormous force against the ground :— his erymy pierced himself on him, and kneeled on his chest, had placed his hands on his throat — when the glass of money torehes penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, troubled him ;— he instantly rose, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the dorm, and in an inelement the erasing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still 1; and Aubrey, Incapable of moving, was soon heard by those with out. They entered; their light of their strokes fell up the mud walls, and the lhatch laid on each individual straw with heavy flakes from the foot. To Aubrey's desire, they laid down for her who had clinged him by his cries; he was again left in the darkness; but who was his horror, that the light of the torches flashed once again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his just consummation scrambled in a walrus without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was a vision that arose from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, strained by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was stillness on his face that saw almost as attached as the life that once lived there :—upori his neck and chest were blood, and on his tob were the marks of teelh hating opened the vowel :— to what men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck the horror wilb ,\" A vampire! A Character !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid alongside the beer which had recently been to bim the object of so many brilliant and sarcastic visions, now fallen with the fleur de liise that had died in it. He took refuge in the holiday, almost unconsciously holding in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon mellow by various folds that had been engaged in the scarf of his woman, a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed to Corsica .\" They were unconscionable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; occasionally he called Lord Ruthven and Ianthe — by some unaecountable combination, he seemed to be begging his former companion to spare his love. At another time, he permeated the evils on his top, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Rvlhvcn, at the moment, stifled himself to arrive in Athens, and, of any mobility, on the pillowririg of the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became constantly accompanying bls. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whom he now had the image of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for fault last had caused their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon rebuilt him to his presbytery. His sentence seemed completely changed; he did not appear as an apathetic being that had so appeased Auhrey; but as soon as his convalescence began to accelerate, he withdrew again in the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no difference with the former man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet his fixed gazely on him, with a smile of malicious exultatism playing on his lips: he did not know why, but if the smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to looking at the waves of tidal loss raised by the cold breeze, or to mark the progress of these words, turning, like the over the world, the seven movements ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the spirit that he had once so distinguished now seemed to have fled forever. He was not as fond of sollude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but although he had seized solitude, his mind could not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he ploughed the ruins which he had once frequented, Athens forin stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the uriderwood, in the quest for purple modefl; then suddenly tur-\nrunning round, would show, to his wild imagination, his purple face and his wounded throat, with a sweet smile on the herlips. He has determined himself to sneaky scenes, all the characteristics that fuel such bitter associations in his mind. Ho proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he was bound by the tender care which he had taken from him during his illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece neither had seen again. They traveled in all directions, the cold looked for all places where a recollection could be attached; but thought they hadtened to the place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to take over these reports, that they were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of those that they defended against alleged dangers. Because of this lack of opinion of the inhabitants, they traveled only with a few guards, more to serve as guides than to defend. On the training, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottling of which was a little bit of a torrent, with great inasses of rock descended from the precipice nelghbouring, they had the reason to repent more negligent; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their head, and hy the ratio echoed with febrile cannons. In an instant, their guards left them, and, placing them behind the rocks, they started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Rutbven and Aubrey, imitating the example, withdrew for a moment, entered into the bend sheltering from the desolation; but they struck to be thus held by a face, who insulted themselves to push them forward, and being exposed to the slave without resistance, if one of the thieves were to climb up and take them back, they decided both to rush against the word long search of the enernia. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Steven received a bot in the shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was wounded, thrown his arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his friend bledod to a nearby hut; and bavirig accepted a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by the elder president — they were simply happy to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ru. The strength quickly weakened; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed to be unconscious of the pain that he had been objects about him; but, towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently unease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was forced to offer him more ordinary with help .\" See me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I don't mean my first wife, I listened to the teeth of my life as literal as that of the passing day; but you can save my honor, the happiness of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \" I need, but a few things — my life fades — I cannot explain everything — but if the yav hides everything you know, my honor was free to stain the mouth of the world — and if my death was unknown some time in England — I — but life. \"—\"He must be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, raising him. \"If, with exulting violence, swear by all your soul, by all the Yaurian nature, swear, for a year and a day, you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \"- His eyes seemed to burst from the bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubroy; he sank loughi. Ng on his pillow, and didn't breathe.\nAubrey rested, but didn't slide; the many circumcised who were attending his knowledge arose upon his spirit, and he didn't know why; when he remorsed hifted oath of a chilling cold came upon him, as if from the presentation something horrible awaited him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the corpse, when a thief met him, and informed him that it was no longer the thero, after having been transported by himself and comrades, to retreat bis, to the peninsula of a nearby mountain, in accordance with a promise they had given to his seigneury, he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the moon than rosc after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot, the prostitute quickly. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the shoe thieves reported the idenlic rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his reindeer was puzzled in conjectures, but he returned to a loss, convinced that they had buried Tbe corpsc for the good of Tbe clothes.\nWeary of a country which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all apparently conspired to increase this pilgrim melancholy which had seized the bis spirit, he rallied to leave it, quickly went to Smyrna. While waiting for a visa to give him your Otrarito, or in Naples, he hopes to arrange the effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and alagans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding an apparently ornamented sheath in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — basting to obtain more evidence, is the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he disappoints that he was equivalent, although particularly shaped, the sheath which held his hand. His eyes did not seem to need any other certainty: it seemed that he was bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to disbelieve; but the particulate form, the same different shades on the shaft and sheath were also in splendor on both, and left rio root for doubt; there were drops of alfo blood on the axe.\nHe left Smyma, and one of his home manners, in Rome, his first investigations concerned the lady whom he had tried to seize the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not known the scene since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey's mind became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; to be afraid that the lady had been victimized by the destroyer of nature. He was morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, if he were saving the life of someone he held dearly. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to the will, soon bulwarked him on the English shores; and hastened upon the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of this sister, all the memory of the past. If she were before, by her infariline caresses, child gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear to, she was still inoro attached as an accompaniment.\nMiss Aubrey didn't just win thanks to which goins the look and applauds the salon assemblies. Thero was none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a rolled apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholic charm on this subject which was not some to be born of misfortune, but of a certain charge inside, which seemed to indicate a curious soul of a brighter kingdom. His sleep wasn't as light, which went astray where a butterfly or a color could attract – he was a sodad pensive arid. When cloned, her father never shed light with the smile of joy; but when her brother breathed her affection, and would forget in her presence those sorrows that she knew destroyed bis rest, who had excharigod her smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, that face, were then played in the middle of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been banned in the world. She had been more fit by her guardians than her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned from the continent, when he could be her protector. So it was now solved by the noxt salon, which was the approaching fault, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey preferred to rise in the house of his father, and he fed on the melancholy that prevented him. He could not tarnish the club interest the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind had been torn apart by the events he had put in mind; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in Lownn, and prepared for the next day, which had 6 th announced as a drawing-rooin.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all the women were anxious about your bask in the smile of reality, hastened there. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was alone in a carner, he did not take into account the bottlenecks, remembering that the men he had seen were there, he felt seized by the arm, and a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in his ear :\"Remember your cloth .\" He had the courage to turn, fearing a specter that would explode him, when he perceived, at a bit of discord, the same with figure had drawn his attention to this place on his first entry in society. He looked until his limbs almost refused their weight, which was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with horrible steps, and fixed groups on his head, as if he were afraid his thoughts burst from his brairi. Lord Ruthven once again took over him — circumstances began in a terrible picture — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead rise again! e :— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind had rested. It was impossible for him to be read 1— so he decided to go back to society; for tough, he told us to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in the gain information. He began to sew nights later with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a nuclear, he retired into for a break, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. He went away, and entered another room, and found his sister surrounded by several people, apparently in a serious insurrection; and he tried to pass by and approach her, when someone, who was asked to move, turned to him, and revealed to him these quarrels that he was screaming the most. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and rushed, and forced him into the street; and at the door he took himself of the crowd of searchers, who were waiting for their lords; and, while H .C. was in charge of striking them, he heard again the voice that drew near to him :\"Remember your oath !\"He dared not turn, but, pressing on his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If, before a subjeet absorbed his mind, how much more completely he was engrossed, now that the certainty of the monster's life again prevailed over his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she introduced her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He only had a few words, arid those who terrified him. The more he flew, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not averted itspragress? Maybe he hit his squirrel. But even if he broke his oath, and described his suspicions, who would accuse him? He thought he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he would remember, the child was already mocked. For days, he remained in the state; he rose up in his remorse, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister Carne, who, with eyes, bloody tears, begged him, for his good, to break nature. In Lasl, unable to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from the street to street, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the rioon-day sun as the midnight damps. He was no longer recognized; first he returned with the evening to the house; but finally he laid home to rest wherever faligue overtaken him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow him; but they soon distracted him who fled from a chase schutter any – even thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend ainongst them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite the oath of hjs, all that Lord Steven approached with intimacy. Bul, when he entered a room, his gazes of haggard and suspensive were so striking, his inner chills so visible, that his sister began to beg him to seek, for her, a wisdom that affected so strongly Bim. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards felt fit to intervene, and, harassing themselves that his mind was alienated, they thought it was a high lime to take back that truly that had previously been imposed upon them by the pickers of Aubrey.\nDesirous of saving him from the wounds and sufferings which he had encouraged every day in his wanderings, and as preventing him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they confided in madness, they set up a doctor to reside in the house, and take care of him by dismayers. He hardly seemed to notice it, if completely his mind was joined by a terribic subject. This incoherrice finally became so great, that he finished in his room. There, he often lied for days, unsatisfied by being rude. He had become emaciated, the eyes of his had clothed a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and remembering remclining had defied his sister's writing; then he was going to begin at home, and, grasping his hands, with glances that severely deafened him, he wanted his riot to touch him. \"Oh, touch him at the riot, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he referred, his only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And again, he sank into a state, from which she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted many months: graduated, however, class the year had passed, his incoherenes became a loss frequent, and his mind threw a part of his glaom, which I saw his guordions,thal several linden day intbe, he counted on his fingers a certain number, and their smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, at the end of the year, one of his guards entering his room began to converse with his doctor on the mechanical circumstance of the being of Aubrey in so as a situatlori, where his sister was going to marry the next day. Instant allergy attention was alticated; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with his return mark from the intellect, whose they feared that which had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Marsden earlier. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and surprised them even more by helping expressing his intention to be ready to the nuptials, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer. His sister was angry with him. It was apparently again a capatile to be affected by the influence of his lovely smile; for he pressed her into her chest, and kissed her cheek, wet with tears, flowing on the other hand, the thought of her brother being more alive to the féolings affair. He began to splash with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on his marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and all that relates to it; when he suddenly perceived a medallion on his chest; by opening it, what was his surprise that the characteristics of a monster who had his long influence on his life. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and tramples it under the imbecile. After asking Hirn why he destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her, then shaking his hands, and looking at her with a frenetic expression bone figure, he told her to swear that she would have laughed at this monster, because he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice had asked him to remember his oath again — he suddenly waved, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but did not see anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and who thought it was only a retum of her disorder, sprained, afraid of Miss Aubrey, asked her to leave him. He fell on their knees of the bis, implored, begged them to delay, but for one day. They were trying to pacify him and withdraw.\nLord Ruthven had broken into the living room in the morning, and had been refused with another truth. He heard of Avbreys ill health, and he readily understood himself to be the object of it; but when he apprehended him, he was judged mad, his arid exultation of pleasure could be defamed from those whom he had acquired this information. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and by the constant presence, and the claim of a great affection for him to shine and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained the lock of Miss Aubrey. Who could make him lose his power? His language had dangers and canvases that he was telling—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy for the existence of an ari on the overcrowded earth, if he had only to enumerate soothing accents ;— could say how, since he knew, his existence, he felt worthy of preservation, if he could simply make soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents art, or which would the will of destiny, that he won his afflictions. To the title of the elder brash falling long to him, he obtained a major ambush, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage tob ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which took place the very day before the departure bis for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the physicist and his ardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a phone and paper; it was him; he wrote a letter to his sister, concerning beer, as she appreciated his own bappiness, his own honor, and the honor of those who knew in the grave, who once held her in arms as their hape and the hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind any more, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without resting the innate body of the house; and Aubrey heard, in mind, a horror that may be easier to conceive than described, the notes of the preparation body. The morning came, and the sound of the wagons crept on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. This curiosity finally seized their vigilance, they gradually stole it, leaving it in the vice of an old powerless woman. He seized the opportunity, with an affair, was out of the room, at a time in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to persecute him: he immediately approached, arid, taking his arm by force, rushed Hiin from the rubbish, voiceless with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven whistles his ear. \" Remember your oath, and know, except for my brilliance until today, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his assistants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come in search of him. Aubrey could no longer supplant himself; his rage was not angry, had broken a blood vessel, and he was chained to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the husband left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey increased; bloodshed produced symptoms of TB near the collapse of death. He wanted his sister guards to be an Illed, afraid when midnight had struck, he would tell in a composite way what the reader persisted, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards hadtened to protect Miss Aubrey; but that they arrived was too late. Lord Ruthven had already appeared, and the Sisler of Aubrey had slipped the first bone to VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF BYRONS ORDER ON MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, were to choose the right place of rest, and Providence his gravy .\"\nIn the year 1882, we sail through the Greek in Archipelago, aboard one of His Majesty's ships, and put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of the name of the Lord. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables always have to have there, induces many Britishesses that visit it — both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, its bottles pay a great deal for the development of a voyage. As usual, at the bottom of the bay, men were used to water, and the shipowner was negotiating for cattle with the natives, the clergyman and I were banging a ramble at the creek called Homers School, and other places, what we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small monticulque so named) we met with and hired a young Greek as our guide, who put us in a bad shape Scio with a Lord Eng 1, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his club. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose a quil Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, very good. The house on the hill, in front of the river, makes him long, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the wino-trader, six zechines hundrod for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided there about fourteen months, but not oonantly; for hc veils in his club very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account greatly exacerbated our curiosity, and we did not waste time hastening from the house where our peasant had resided. We were nice to have received by an old man, who was driving us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a drawing walk, a sitting room and a bathroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They are all decorated in a simplified way: green-coloured walls, marbled lables on both sides, a large myrtle in the corner line, and a fontoine below, which would be played through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small bronze Vonus in a bent poster; a large hearing or sofa completes the furniture. In the room, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty book vase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The child's bedroom only has a large matte mass spread over the floor, with two cotton teddy quilts and a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the meeting room, we observed a morble corner. Once, the old man told us, faithful with books and papers that we then had in the trunk of a large sailor in the closet: it was open, but we did not think that our two bodies were justified in examining the contents. The works of Voltaire, Shakspeccle, Boileau and Rovsseau are finished; VolneyfRuins of Empires; Zimmerman, in the German language; the Messiah of Klapsloek; the novols of Kotzebue; the game of the Robbers of Schjller; the Paradise of Millon Lost, Italian Ari edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the small pamphlets of the Groek press in ConstantiriopIe, very torn, but no English book of all the disccriplion. Most of these books were filled with original notes, written with cell peneil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was first scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said :\" The Lord had been reading....\nirigates these books till evening before he greeted, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for it is so special that if I move a thing without order, it would frown upon me for a week together; it is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once; and I had the product of this farm for the difficulty of taking care of it, except twenty zechins which I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought Berc of Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty long steps and fourteen large, and the canned millars with hlack plinths and cargo-work work cornices (as it is now usual in the Greek architect ), was considered higher than the roof. The roof, overwhelmed by a light stone bolustrade, was covered with a thin turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus satisfied, as on them the Greeks pass their enigres in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma ehristi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the enigreous breeze.\nOn the left, as we entered the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large husées of myrtlc, a marble on the back of wooden waf placod ornamental, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until you read, read, scribed, and spoke to him. \"I beg,\" said the old man ,\"praying\" because he was very fervent ,\" and always attended our times twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was of the whale can be called \"a view of birdeye\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, co-vored with olive and bluertle trees in bloom, and on the summil whose ancient temple Greek appeared in majestic Deccly. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountains. The sea smootb cls glass, and a horizontal urishadod by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; spans a little ori the left, through a view of high chesnul ond palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the wave of blue light with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a gruesome view that I did; but our enemies were fruitless as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\" could say so, but I don't know ,\" he said ,\" and can you tell me, my old friend ?\" he said ,\" If I care ,\" he said ,\" I wouldn't dare .\" We didn't have time to watch American, but on our return to the city, we learned several particulars of the secluded lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island of Tbe, and had even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gives a cow to a man, horses, love others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a whole fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from the whole we touched, for being a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstanco that we laud, that our old friend at home tangbt own not to reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, the lord, was often seen walking on the sea, and he had bought him a piano-forte, and taunted him himself the use of it.\nThis was the information with which we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imagination all about the rock, guessing who this rambling in Greece could be. He had the obvious monoism: he had the philarithropy of the arrangement, and also these eccentricities that mark the particular genius. When we arrived at Paromo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect tobe, a WYATTIC pilot, who had been travelling in Egypt and Greece ,\"The individualol,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so anxious about, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mililene.\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the clause of Calcla iri every page. Deeply we did not regress not having been more curious in our reservists at the cottage, but we got confused with the idea of returning to Mitylene one day of suture; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, making it appear that it is not uninteresting, and in the outside, this name is a good of Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, a reluctance to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to satisfy its sorrows, or to add to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be clearly collected from these little onecdates. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his lordship, seem to have their seat in her bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to give all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of Solite is a key reason to mark him as a being on which Rellgion sealed his heart, and on whose head, Benovolcence threw his coat. No man can read the previous losing \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. With regard to his love or plea, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. Relationships are always received with the clutiori, especially when they are directed against the moral irradiatedness of man; and the one who dares to justify himself wonders that the horrific trihunal where everything must appear, only can censor the errars of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is dreadful of his genius. To do good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is a safer testirnony of a virtuous heart and self-approval consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Sleet.",
    "41": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very gencrale to the East. Ainong the Arabians it seems to be common: it did, however, oxtorid at the Greek temple only after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken on its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which time, the idea of becoming predominant, that a Latin body could riot correct so drunk on their territory, it has increased gradually, the object of many stories of wonder, still in progress, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the west, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorrajne, where the bolief existed, that the vampyres nightly soaked some of the blood of their victims, which were emerging, losing their strength, and specdily died of consumption; while these suckers of human blood grazed, they clinged to such a state of replenishment, to cause the blood of all the passages of their bodies to flow, and even to sow the pores even of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March 1732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrlsm, which is started in Haho, took place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates, they stated positively and without a joke that, about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, set in motion Arnold Paul, had heard scly, that, at Cassovicl, on the brothers of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the land over from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a vampire hesels; for, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complain about being tormented by him, in a statement was fashion, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. To avoid other malices, the inhabitants consulted their Hadagni, took vp the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual cases of vampyrisrn) fresh, and completely free of corrugation, instigating the mouth, nosc, and ears, liver and flower blood. As the evidence was thus closed, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was led entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have cried as terribly as he was alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of people who had already died of vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents who survived them.\nThe universal belief just that a person selected by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of the current observations than any other instance that could be added. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of purishmerite after death, for a heinous crime committed when it existed, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but is forced to corrupt his infernal visits only to those who loved him most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection. — An assumption that has not been retained in the \"Giaour\".\nBut, as Vampyre sent him to the earth, your Corsica will be torn from his tomb; then he will haunt the native land, and he will suck the blood of all your race; from thence of your daughter will lick, woman, on the night of nridnight drain the stream of life; and yet loclth the bank that performs must feed your living corsus, your victims, still exhale, will know the devil for their sire; as you irrigate them, your flowers will dry out on the stem. But a goal for your crime must fall. The youngest, the best loved of all, will bless you with the father near me — This word will wrap your heart in flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then, with the unhumiliated hand will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — But now is home far from the Mcinorjal of your agony! But if the best blood flow, thy gnashings unto the 0 th, and the lip of the hook; Tben harassing the tomb of sulten, Go, and with Gouls, and Afrits rave, till the women in the boundor depart from the spectre more secure than they.\nMr. Sovhey also introduced in the wild hif blue beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampy course of the good Arab Oneiza, which is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormenting whom she loved better wealth in existence. But this cannot be broken for having resulted from the sinful naves in her life, she being paurtrayed throughout the tale of a complete type of purity and innooence. The Ueracious Tournofort gives a long account in his travels of several clever cases of vampyrism, also which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of aneodoles, and traditional norrative illustrito of its effects, has put sarth some leorinated dissertations, tending to prove that it is an elastic error, as well as barbarous.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this singularly boring superstition could be added; although the present can rely on the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explanation, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the Vampyre lerm is true in most general acceptances, there are several other synonyms with it, rnade use of in various parts of the world: from Vrucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Brueloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nThus, in the midst of the dissipations of the London winter, he appeared in various parts of the leopards of the story, a noblemary, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could participate in the riot. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair only attracted his attention, so that he could by cl watch choking, and throw fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling could not explate from where he stood: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, by staring at the face of the object, seemed penetrated, arid at a glance to pierce through the inward work of the hour; but fell on the cheek with a radius of lead weighed on the skin which he could not pass. His particularities invited him to be invited to all houses; all wanted to see him, and those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and who now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence that could attract the attention of our attention. In the epile of the dead tint of her face, which never spoiled a warmer tint, either of the shade of modesty, or of the emotion of passion, although its shape and contours were helpful, many women hunters after notoriété tried to get her attentions, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call clsfection: Lady Mercer, who had seen the mockery of the euery monster shewri in the drawing rooms from her marriage, threw himself in his way, arid did everything but put on the dress of cl moritebank, to attract the attention bis :— but in vain :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her, although it seemed like if they were unporceived ;— even her inanimate impudence was trampled, and she left the field. But the common adults could not even influence the direction of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: however, this was the apparent caution with which he spoke to the virtual woman and the innocent girl, while few knew that he had never addressed him to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tongue; and if it was that he even though he overcomes his singular character, or was touched by the apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among the women who boast of their sox from their domestic values, as among those who push him through their vicef.\nAt about the same time, he arrived at Loridon, the young gentleman of the name of Aubroy: he was an orphan left with only sister in possession of hail wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by the guards, who taught them simply to take care of his fortune, while they renounced the important charge of his mind to care about the substances mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, therefore, this high romantic price of honor and frankness, which every day ruined so many millennerf apprentices. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and yet, a shot victim was trampled by Providence inerly for the effort piece of the scene. then, as we dries in the rannances: he thought that the misery of a cottage was limited to giving off elothes, which ch were af hot, but which were better adapted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He thought, in line, that poets' dreams were the rakes of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered gay circuses, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing favourites of roinping: the girls at the same time, by their illuminating relations when he approached, and by brilliant eyes, when he opened his lips, I soon put him in false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached to the rannance of his solery lovers, he was surprised to discover that, except in the tallow and the wax candles shot flickered, not from the price of the mind, but from the lack of snuffing, there was no basis in real life for any of these congreries of plcasing images and defriptions contained in these uolomas, from what he had formed his studies. However, finding some compensation for his graceful vanity, he was able to abandon his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above went through him in his career.\nHe looked at the hjm; and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in herself, who gave a few other signs of his observation of extremal objects, that the tao sanctioned their existence, irritated by the avoidance of the contact heir: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soari formed this object in the hero o romance, and dlerminé to observe the effusion of fantasy hif, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far advariated on his opinion, that his presence was always recognized. Little by little, Lord Ruthvens business was embarrassed, and he quickly discovered, from the preparation notes in — Street, that he was on the journey. From sirovs to get information respecting this singular character, which, until now, had only sharpened his curiosity, he suggested to his guards that it was time for him to tour, which he had been doing. Many generations thought it necessary to enable young to take a few quick stops in the career as vice-tenders putting themselves on an equal footing with the elderly, and not allowing them to appear as if they had fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of competence carrying them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking their intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to get him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of him, who, apparently, had nothing to coinmori with the other mon, he accepted it gradually, and in a few days they had passed the letters cirolling.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the baracter of Lard Ruthven, and now he found that, about a lot more of his actions were exposed to his view, the results had made different enunciations of the apparent motives of his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;— be idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the thousand-sfortunes, even on life, that he was lowering his alarms ;- these were sent to sneeze the door with sneezes barely removed; hut when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his warriors, but to allow him to water himself in his lust, or to sink him still in his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by him the greater import of the vicious, which usually takes him away from the retirement of the uirtuous needy. There was a circumstance around the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, irietuously found that there was a curse on him, because they were all led to the scaffold, or funk to the lowest and the most abject misery. In Brussels and other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent impatience with which his flourishing endeavoured for the centres of all the sasbionable vices; there he entered into the spirit of the soro table: he bet, always clinged to success, except where the best known was the bif antagonist, and then he lost even more than he earned; but it was always with the same immutable face, with whooh, he generally looked at the socioty around: it was not, however, so much so that he met the young novice rosé, or the father without chance of a family numcros; then his very desire to see the law of fortune mod — this apparent abstraction of the spirit began, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In every city, he left the affluent youth avant-garde, tarry of the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the loneliness of a dung, the fate which had drawn him into the reason of this friend; while many a father sat friantic, in the midst of the spanking resembles hungry children, with one end of his last immense wealth, where to buy even enough to falsify their present croupion. Yet he did not take money from the table; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last gorilla he had just pulled from the convulsive transplant of the innocent: this might but to be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the experiment. Aubrey often wanted to tell his friend again, and beg him to put on the face of this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and which did not have to do his own profit ;— but he delayed — for the day when he had a business friend would give bim an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, it never happened. Lord Ruthven in his cartage, and in the midst of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and even though Aubroy was close to the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gratification than the constant excitement of vainly desire to break this mystery, which your exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon came to Rome, and Aubrey, for a time, lost sight of his companion; he left him in the waiting diary on the snoring circle of an Italian country, while he went into the search of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters arrived near England, which he opened with impatience; the first was from his sitter, breathing nothing but affection; the others were of his guards, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was an evil power residing in a hif companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted that he immediately left his fried, and urgod, that the basic character was terribly serious, for the possession of irresistible powers of seduction, made his loyal habits more dangerous to society. It had been discographed that his contempt for adultery had not arisen in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, to strengthen his gratitude, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, be cast out of the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of the abyss and degradation: in the end, that all the semals which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the deformation of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on the which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning him completely, purposing, in the meantime, to monitor him more closely, and not to let go of slight circumferences without mention. He entered the same circle, and soori perceived that his Lordship was striving to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady who was the house which he was mainly flogging. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was forced to keep her plaris in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, arid quickly discovered that the ari assignment had been appointed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though thought the girl. Not wasting time, he entered Lord Rutbven's apartment, and abruptly as he did his interitions with the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her this very laugh. Lord Ruthveri replied that his intentions were such that he believed that I would go to such an attack; and after having been in a hurry to know whether he intended to marry him, there was only one laugh. Aubrey retired;\nFrom that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the visit that he proposes, he orders his servant to seek other departures, addressing his mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also as regards the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. The next day Lord Ruthven simply sent his servant to announce his complete consent to a separation; but he did not indicate that a suspect would have been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soori took care to cross the rocks faded of ancient glory on the monuments which seem-\n, shameful of telling the acts of free men only in front of slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or a lot of color ured lichen. Under the same roof itself, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she migrated to form the made for a painter wanting to pour on canvas the promised hope of the paradise of the faithful iri Mabomet, except that her eyes spoke too much of spirit so that Ari thought that it might belong to those who have no souls. As she danced on the planet, or stumbled on the side of the mountain of Tbe, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of beer beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the bitter nature, for that drowsy luxurious look of the suitable animal but to the taste of the eplcury ari. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in her mother after antiquities, and often the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a silver butterfly, would show all the beauty of the shape of the beer, floating as he was on the wind tho, to the greedy look of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, his falling braids, as she fluttered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun being so delicately bright and quickly discoloring the hues, he might Weli excuses the oblivion of the antiquarian, which left the telescope from his very object mind when he had before bought vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausonias. But why try to describe charms that everything feels, but none can appreciate ?— He is innocent, youth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. While he was drawing remains of thososo from which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood up, and watched the magic effects of his pricil, by tightening the scenes of his native place; then she would describe him the dance set up upon the open plain, would painting, in bim in all the flamboyant colors of young memory, the wedding pump that she remembered vjewing in her early childhood; and then, turning to subjects that had obviously made an impression of graft on her mind, would tell her the punctual stories of her nurse. His pride and his apparent belief in the whale were narrated, aroused the jnitrost even of Aubrey; and often, as the sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which had spent years amplifying his friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, feeding on the life of a beautiful fairyle to prolong his existence for the months erecting, his blood was running cold, while he tried to lo lavgh hor out of such idle and horrible fantasies; but Iclnthe attached to him the names of old men, who had at last detected one living among them, after several of their children rar roulatives surd had found 6 th marked with the stamp of the appetite of the friend; upon him, when she found him so unbelievable, she begged to assimilate him, for he had pointed out that those had brawn to question their existence, always so proved, and to confess it to them. She stripped him of the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his terminal was iricreasod, hearing a rather precise description from Lord Ruthven; he, however, still persuaded iri persuadling ber, trot there would be no truth in his fears, though at the time he worked to the coincidees mary who had all tended to excite a celib in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Iarithe; innocence out, so contrasted with all the distressed virtues of these women among whom he had sought for his vision of romance, won his horrendous; while he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habit, marrying or without instruction Greek girl, he was even more attached to the almost fetid form before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antique research, he left, decided not to return until his attention was reached; but he always found it impossible to focus his attention on the ruins adorn him, while in his mind he kept on the image that seemed to be the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was harmless from his love, and he loved the same frank child he had known first. She always seemed to leave him with relucency; but it was 6 c because he had no danger with which she could visit her favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or discovering a fragment that had escaped the destructive hand of time. She had aspired to her parents on the subject of companies, and both, with the several parents, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the very name. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which begged him for the detail for a few hours; when they heard the dream of the place, they all begged not to return at the same time at night, because he did not spend ceaselessly through wood, that no Greek would ever remain, after the day has been lost, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resorle of the vampyres in their night orgy, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared cross their way. Aubrey made light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but who he saw shudder to his audacity so as to mock a superior, infernal power, the same name as which apparently made their bload freezc, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left unattendedly on his excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy facio of his shot, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them to such a terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his harlot, and earnestly begged him to return, and the night passed by allowed the power of these eyebrows to be put in the action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with the research that he did not perceive that the light-death would soon end, arid that on the horizon there was one of those spots that, in warmer climates, so quickly picked up a huge mass, and poured all their rage over the devoted country .— He finally counted his horse, however, determined to catch up with speed for his delay: but it is too late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night hegins: and the ore that he had advanced far, the storm's power was above — its thunders holding hold barely a resting interval — its thick heavy rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue radig began to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, the horse scared, and they carried him with a terrible clpidity in the tangled forest. The animal with salt, through satigue, ignited, and found, by the glabre of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a hovel that barely rose vp from the masses of dead Ieaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, which approached, hoping to find one to spoil him in the city, or at least trusting in the shelter of Ohtoin from the stuffing of the stork m. As he sat down, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the terrible screams of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting with a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised: but, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the open door of the cabin. He found himself in dark darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived because, although he called, the sounds continued, we did not notice any harm. He found himself in contact with someone whom he seized immediately; when a voice cried out ,\" Again mocked !\" to whom a great laugh succeeds; and he felt harassed by him whose strength seemed so cold: dissuaded from selling his life as hard as he could, he wrestled; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feet and threw huge forces against the ground: his enemy threw him by force, and his knee 1 on his chest, had laid his hands on his throat — when the brightness of many torches penetrated the hole that lit him in the day, troubled him; to the moment he rose up, and by searching for his prey, rushed through his back, and in an instant the crushing of the bronchi, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those without. And they came in, and the light of their torches fell upon the walls of the ground, and the thatch loaded upon every individual straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubreys desire, they sought her who had attracted him to his cries; he was again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, to pierce the aerial form of his beautiful leader brought a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he stripped them, stifled by his sido. There was no colour on his cheek, not evon on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed almost bone attached as the reading that once lived here :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth that had worked on the vein :— that is how men pointed, wept, hit the horror simultaneously ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside her, who had recently been the object of so much brilliant and magical vision, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He didn't understand what he said.\nHis thoughts were gnawing and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the holiday, he saw in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had money in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had committed themselves in fear of her that a mother had missed. As they approached the city, their 1 important screams warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe their mourning would be impossible; but that they checked the cause of their child's teeth, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the course .\" They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with a very vl olent fever, and was delusional; in these inlervalides he would call on Lord Ruthven and on Ianlhe — by some inexplicable comhination, he seemed to beg of his companion to remember the savings of being he loved. At other times, he would stop the inalegations on his head, and curse him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive at Athenf, and, of any motive, on the pillow of the state of Aubrey, placed himself immediately in the same house, and became his accompanying eonator. When the latter recovered from his delirium, he was borrified and astonished at the sight of him whose indigence he had now combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving a very great repentance for the sick which had caused their separation, and even more by the attention, onxie, and care which he showed, soon reconciled with his present. His seigneury seemed to change from quinquel; he no longer resembled an apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as his convalescere began to be quick, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meet his gaze fixed with insistence on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was apparently committed to watching the tidal waves raised by the cooling breeze, or to mark the progress of those or 6s, clinging, like the aur world, the sun without revolution ;—en-\nHe seemed to want to avoid everyone's eyes.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was much weakened, and that the elifecity of the mind that once had its bim diftinguished now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as fond of solitvde and net as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his mind could not find him in the district of Athenf; it sought ainidsl the ruiris which he had peasantly freckled, the shape of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the words, his light step seems wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, the irisl of the modest violet; their suddenly turned red, showed, to his wild imagination, his pale and injuring face, with a sweet smile upon her lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all the fetuses who created such bitter associations in his mind. He promised Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him bound by the tender cleavage that he had taken him during his illness, that they had to use these parts of Greece another again. Tobeytravel 1 went to selfishness, and looked for every place where one could straighten out; but although they hadtened from one place to another, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard such brigands, but they gradually began to digest these relationships, which they only imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose interest was to stir up the generosity towards those whom they were carrying out so-called dolphins. Because of this neglect of the council of the inhabitants, they once worked with only a few guards, more to serve as a guide than a defense. Upon entering, However, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rock descended from the neighboring prespices, he had Roclson to repent of their negligence; for he was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were surprised by the whistle of the bullets near their heads, and by the echoed report of several cannons. In an insurrection, their guards were afraid to place themselves behind the rocks, and they had started firing in the direction where the report came from. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the sbelterring tower of the defilement: but eager to be so detached by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, cried out to them, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, if one of the thieves were to go up above and place them in the back, they immediately decided to reach forward in search of the enemy. Barely bad they lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to a grurid. Avbrey hastened to help him; the avil, which no longer takes account of the contest or of his own peril, is surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards flouting, on the wound of Lord Ruthven, immediately cast their orders and handed over.\nBy promising a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; clinging to a ransom, he was no longer disturbed by their prefence; they simply kept the intern until their comrade came back with the promiscundum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly collapsed; in Morlificatian two days followed, and the struggle seemed to move forward with hasty steps. His eonducator and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that he had had the objects that surrounded him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind became apparently at ease, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering a help with more seriousness than usual — Assist me! Perhaps you will save me, perhaps more than, I do not mean my life. I obey the death of my existence as little as the gift of passing; but you save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little, of my life exists Japanese, I cannot explain everything — but if you hide everything you know from me, my hanour was the free defilement in the mouth of the world — and if my death was unknown for a while in England —I—full life. \" We know the riot. \"---\"Swear!\" used the dying man,rasirighim with exulting violence ,\"Swear by all your soul reveres, by all your nature thrays, jurtbat, sor a year and a scly you will not communicate your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can seo. \"- His eyes seemed moving to their socket :\" I swa r !\" said Aubrey; he laughed on the pillow of hjs, and breathed rio more.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at his aquointance with this man arose on his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold calmer came on the hive, as if a horrible of something pending bim. From the beginning of the snoring, be about to enter the hotel where he had left the corpse, when O Robber met him, and informed him that it was not a loriger there, having been transmitted by him-\nHe and his comrades, at his retirement, at the pirinacle of a neighbouring mooring, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, talk, he should be oxidized to the first cold rock of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey was astonished, and taking several of the men, determined to go and cook him on the spot where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the ropes or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the identical rock on which they had a hard body. For his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the love of their clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such earthly misfortunes, and in which I apparently conspired to increase this pilgrimic melancholy that child cries on his mind, he decided to leave him, and quickly arrived at Smyrna. While waiting from a distance for a ship to take him to Otranto, or to Naples, to arrange for the effects of those that he had with him, being part of Lord Ruthuen. Amongst the things, other there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the death of the victim. There were several doggers around the attacks. While the curious forms were being exarned, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently embedded in the same slyle as the dagger discovered iri the fatal hut — he shuddered — he shuddered — has a secret to obtain the further proof, he found the weapon, and the horror could be imagined that it was found to be the sheath that he held in his hand, although particularly shopped. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to be related to the dagger; but still he cursed himself disbelief; but in particular shape, the same varied shades on the hash and shoath were similar in the splondour on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Rome, his first investigation into the lady whom he had tried to stretch the seductive arts of Lord Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their forlone ruined, and she had not been bearded since the detachment of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken without so many repeated horrors; he was afraid to hit this lady who called a victim to the destroyer of nature. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was difficult in exhorting the speed of the lhepostilions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He came to Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon tumbled him to the English shoes; and he hastened to the mansiori of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in the embraces and hearts of his sisler, all the memory of the post. If, before, by her infantile caresses, she had acquired her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was still more attacking as a companion.\nMifs Aubrey had not won much thanks to which gaining the look and applause of the salon assemblies. There is none of this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been lit the levitated from the mind below. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not revolt to sow misfortune, but with a certain feeling inside, that seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not this footing light, which strclys where to wear a butterfly or a color can attract — he was sedated and pensive. When alone, the neck face was never illuminated by the smile of joy; but when her brother took his family into account loudly, and would be in the presence of forgetting those deed that she was able to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged her smile so that the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been brought to war. He had been thought by his guards more threaded than his presentation should be doubted until the return of his broth and the continent, that he could be his protector. It was therefore now resolved that the next drawing-roorn, which was fast approaching, would have been the epoch of its entry into the \"occupied scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in his father's house, and he fed on the melancholic that surpassed him. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of the fashionable strangers, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon came to town, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive, a drawing roam had riots held for an long time, and all those who were eager to rest in the king's tob smile, hastened this. Aubrey was there with her sister. As he stood alone in a corrier, without taking into account all that was around him, he entered the recollection that the most fateful time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in his place, he suddenly fell grasped by his arm, arid a voice which he recognized too well, sounded in the ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had the hard courage to turn, fearing to see a spectre would wave him, when he was poaching, at a little distance, the same figure who had drawn his attention to his spol when he first entered the into society. He fought until his limbs almost refused to boar the weight of the boar, he was forced to take a friend's arm, and to force the passage through the crowd, who fell into his car, and was taken home. He hastened to stop the room, and fixed his haries on the heel, as if he feared that the thoughts of bis would burst out of his brairi. Lord Ruthven once again seized him—circumstances began in a draconian painting—the dagger—his oath .—Ho woke up, he could not believe that it was possible—the dead are resurrected again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — he decided, accordingly, to go back to society; because although the chef tried to ask to convince Lord Ruthven, the name hanged on his lips, he failed to obtain the information. He left a few days later with his sister, the assembly of a close relative. Leaving her under the protector of a matron, he retreats into a corner, and the threshing gives her to his own devoring thoughts. Finally, seeing that many women were leaving, he awakened, and entered another room, found his sister overwrapped by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass arid to her, when the one, whom he asked for to move, turned around, and revealed to him these fears that he was most abhorrent. And he went forth, and slew his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, he forced her to the street; and at the door he was stung by the crowd, and the servants waited for them; and when he was engaged by the way, he heard again the voice of thal whispicr near him :\"Remember your oath !\" He did not stop turning, but, pressing his sister, soon came to the house.\nAubrey became almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed upon his thoughts. Her sister's attentists were now irrelevant, and just was in vain that she treated her to explain to her what had capped her sudden introduction. He spoke only a few words, and these terrified him. The more he thought, the more he was suspicious. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, bringing ruin upon his glory, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to prevent his progress? If a very first could have been hit by this thing. But even if he were to blur his oath, and expose his suspicions, who would believe it? He thought of using his own hand to free the band from such a mess; but death, he remembers, had been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; shook in his room, which saw no one, and eaten only who his sister had come, who, with eyes flowing tears with, begged him, for his own good, to support nature. Finally, no more able to carry calm and loneliness, to be left his house, wandered the street from the street, anxious to steal the image that haunts the\nI put it on. His dress calmed down, and he wound up, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be relegated; at first, he returned with the oven to the house; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever the situation overhanged him. His sister, anxious for his safety, stacked people for the follow; but they were soon removed by him who fled from a pursver faster than any thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absence all the friends of hjs, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter society again, and to watch him closely, anxious at first, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intimacy. But if he would hold the irito of the chambre, his distrustful and distrustful eyes were so striking, his inner chills were so visible, at last flouted his sister who had to beg for him to refrain from seeking, his sake, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, theranoe proved unshakeable, the guardians.\nand, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they tangibly he hounded to regain the trust that had previously been imposed upon them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to blow him off from the injury and the suffering he had encountered every day in his wanderings, and to prescribe him from the explosing to the general eye of the marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and constantly take care of him. He hardly seemed to notice just, if completely his spirit was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was entrusted to his carnber. There is often lying for days, unable to wake up. He had become emaciated, the eyes bis child reached a glassy chandelier ;— the only breath of affection and remembrance remains right showed himself at the entrance of his sister; then he would be somewhat slag, and, taking hold of his harries, with eyes that seriously afflict him, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don't kill him, if your love for me is great, come near to him !\" When, however, she enquired to whom he was reciting, her only answer was :\"Truth! True !\" And Ogaln shoved himself into a stew, from which even she did not push him. It lasted many months: gradually, bowing down, as the year passed, his incoherores became less fruitful, and his spirit threw a porcelain of his glaoma, while his guardians observed that the febrile times in the day he would punch on his fingers a certain number, then smile.\nThe time had passed considerably, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his physiclan upon the melancholy circumstance of Avbrey being in such a horrible situation, when his sieve went the next day to get married. Instantly, every attention was drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of intellect, of which he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking of a young country whom he had met with the Irish society, Aubrey seemed astonished, and astonished even more by his expression of the big inlention to be present to the nuptials, and eager to see his fist. They did not reply, but sewing for a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently capable of agaln of being affected by the insluence of his pretty smile; for he pressed her to the chest, and kissed her c beek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother once again living with feelings of affection. He began to speak with all his valet, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distinguished for his rank and all his accomplishments; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; to open it, what was his surprise to see the foals of the monster who had so long influenced his life. Ho s removed the portrait in a paroxysm of a circle, and very flogged under the shot. On her asking why he thus destroyed the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if it were not uriderstand ber — then sejzing his hands, and looking at one with a Francoist expression of face, he told him to swear that she would never marry this monster, so he — but he could not advance — it seemed that this voice made him remember his oath — he suddenly turned out, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but was not sowing anyone. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who struck this wall but a return of his disorder, entered, undercovering from Miss Aubrey, wanted her to abandon him. He fell on his knees for them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing the infallibility that they imagined having seized his mind, were striving for a peaceful bim, arid in retirement.\nLord Ruthven had called the snoring after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he read himself to be the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be correlated with those among whom he had won this infermation. He hastened to the house of his old orid companion, with a constant assiduity, and the claim of great affection to scorch him and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? One could speak of himself as an individual who has no sympathy for any being on the crowded carcass, who loved with her whom he addressed ;— who could say how, since he knew her, her existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, if it was simply that he could listen to his soothing embraces ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the art of heserpent, or this was the will of destiny, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch falling to him in the long term, he obtained an important embassy, which served for an excvse sor, hasten the marriage ,( in the spy bone, the state deronged of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the arid doctor, his guards, tried to bring the servants, but in vain. He asked her for paper and for perish; he was given to her; he gave her a letter, conjured her, as she appreciated her happiness, her honor, and the honor of fighting now in the grave, which once held her in arms as the hope and hope of their house, to undo, but for a few hours this marriage, or that he escaped from the heaviest curses. The servants of Tbe promised that they would deliver him; but in giving this to the doctor, he thought it was a bet to no longer harass the spirit of Misf Aubrey by, what he considered, the confusion of a maniac. The night passed without the rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubroy heard, with a horror that one could more easily conceive their described, the best preparation notes. Morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants of them at the end of their vigilance, they flew away gradually, the washing under the care of an old powerless woman. He took the input, which was out of the room, and found himself at a time in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him, and immediately he received, and, taking his arm by force, he shouted from the chamber, without a voice with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured his ear :\" Remember your oath, and if you are not married today, your sister is dishonored. Women are snoring !\" So he pushed him to his attractions, which, eaten up by the old woman, were not looking for him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his rabies found no ventilation, and he broke a blood vessel, and lay down in bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, like the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage calmed down, the bride and husband left Landon.\nAubrey increases weakness; blood outpouring produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and when the midnight work had slurk, he released what the reader had read, he died.\nThe guard hastened to put Miss Avbrey in, but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACTS OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was also enchanting him, where to choose the place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nSeeing across the gruccan archipelago, on one of Her Majesty huesels, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, in the island by that name. The beauty of his place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still have to have there, educates many British ships to visit—the meri of war and merchants; and although he is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smyrna, his premiums amply reimburse for the gap a voyage. We landed; as usual, the bottom of the bay of Tbe, arid whllst the men we use to water, and the shipowner trading for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical took me a ramble in the cave called Schoo l of Homer, and other places where we had beer before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so riam ed) we met and engulfed a young Greek of our guide, that told us that he had comb from Scio with an Englishlord, that left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he took me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mityl once, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but a good man. Tho oottage on the hill, facing the river, 6 elongs to him, arid he left an old mcln in charge: he gave Dominick, the wine-trclder, slx cent zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ), and resided here about fourcen montbs, thoughnot constity; for he sails in his felueca very often to the diferentislands .\"\nThis account aroused our curiosity a lot, and we did not waste time rushing into the house where our compatriot had settled. We were kindly received by an old man, who smeared us over the house. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor – an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, a dry room bed, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: united grecn walls, marble tables on each side, a large myrtlein center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed in the side of a small bronze Venus in a bent posture; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, encumbered with an empty bookcase: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one big...\nspread over the ground, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the old man told us, filled with hooks of arid papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the boot: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justified to examine the content. The works of Voltaire, Shokspearef, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the Tablet of Recreation; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmormcln, in the German language; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebve; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Italian edition of Milton Paradise Lost, printed in Parma in 1810; the small sevoral pamphlets from the Greek press of Constantinople, very torn, have no description in English. Most of these books were wired with marginal notes, written with a pencil, Italian iri and Latin. The message was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, on which were also remarks.\nThe old man exclaimed :\" The lord had asked to read these books in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; but, he said, they had to go until his return; for her is so special, that if I moved a thing without order, he would frown on me for a week together; otherwise is very good. I have done him a service; and I have the produce of this farm for the trouble of taking care of it, the ox twenty zechin whom I pay to an old Armenlan who dwells in a small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why.\nThe appearance of the outer dung was to bend. The portico at the front was fifty long arid places fourteen wide, and the marble pillars lined with black plinths and work freight-work connections ,( as it is now usual in the French arcbite ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a stone barbecue, was covered with a fine turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse linen strong. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, the Greeks pass over their eels in smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", eat fruit, and enjoy the evening breeze.\nOn the loft's hand, as we entered the house, a small creek slipped, grapes, oranges and lime trees gathered together on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with a back of weaden arnamental, ori we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings late in the nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to him. \"I guess,\" said the old husband ,\"playing\" to be very popular ,\" and always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe point of view of this seat was what could be locked \"a life of bird eyes\". A line of rich vineyards led the yc to Mont Calcla, covered with olive trees and mysterious trees in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream is located from the ruins to descended on broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view of the tree will be; and a little on the left, through the high avista chesnut and palm-trces, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely rejoice in a view more that I did; but our requests were unanswered as to the name of the person who had resided in romantic solitude: nonc knows his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Candia. \"The Armenlon\" said our conductor ,\" could say it, but I'm sure he won\" and don't say it, old friends? said I —\"If I could ,\" said to him ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to look at the Armenian, but a return to the city we learned several details of the isolated lord. He misshared eight young girls who He was the last one on the island, and he even danced with them at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, collnd coltan and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also ruined a new boat for a freshman who had raised his own in a village, and he often gave Greek Teslaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, according to all we collected, to have been a very energetic and beneficial character. A circumstance that we learned, who our old friend at the cottage thought he would not reveal. He had a beautiful master's daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he bought him a piano-strong, and taught himself the use of this one.\nSueh faces the misfortune with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations first of all the rack, guessing who this rambler in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had a philanthropy disposition, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived in Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, architect TBE, a student of WYATTLES, who had been on a trip to Egypt arid Groece ,\"Individual Time,\" he said ,\"about whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him in my lives on the island of Tonedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been in sorne years from the house; cabin \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized Calclas reoluse on every page. Didn't we regret not having been more curious about the research at the cottage table, but we conspired with the idea of returning to Milylene one day of runaway; but to me the total day will never come back. I take this statement, making it appear that it is not entirely uninteresting, and the injustice to the Lordships good reputation, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an unshakeable provision, contrary to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, as can be abundantly collected from these small ancestors. All the finer feelings of the heart, his elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their soul in his bosom. Tenderness, sympathy, and charity seem to guide his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being upon whose heart, religion has put his seal, and upon which he said Benevolence has cast his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling ruddy about him as a victoryman. As far as his washing or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reprimands must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and the one who dares himself, that is, a tribunal said that all must appear, only can censor the errors of a confremortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To make the right secret, and avoid the applause of the world, is the safest tressalany of a virtuous hoax and approval of confidence feelings.\nTHE END!\nGillel, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet-Streot.",
    "42": "A VAMPYRE:\nA little.\nBy John William Poidori.\nTHE FOPESTITION on which this topic is stuffed is very general in the East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not, however, extend to the Greeks it after the establishment of Christianity; and it has on the Iy Assumod its present form since the division of Latin and Greek churches; at that time, idola becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt so buried in the territory lheir, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, until I existed, from the rising dead of their tombs, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the West, it spread, with a certain variety, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria, Lorraine, where the oxist belief, that vampires night soaked a certain part of the blood of their victims' TB, which became emaciated, lost their strength, aridly diod of consurntions; while these blood-suckers human fat—rides their dry veins to such a state of repletion, to cause the blood of all passages of the bodies of Ihera, and eueri of the very pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal, on March 1732, is a credible account, and, of course, a particular oasis of varpyrism, which is said to have taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the coin and the magisterials of the square, they affirmed positively and without animosity, that about five years earlier, o certainly Heyduke, named Arnold Paul, had heard saying, that, in Cassova, at the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to ridicule himself of evil, eating part of the earth of the vampy grave, and rubbing him with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from being himself a victim of a vampy; so, about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, the people only complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four persori had been deprived of life by his bags. In order to prevent the overthermal rnisohief, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, arid found it (as it is supposed to be usual in cosmpyrisms) fresh, and completely free of correction, and emitting to the mouth, nose, undisturbed ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was thus erased, they resolved to the usual comedy. A stake was completely pushed through the arid body of Arnold Pavl's heart, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been olive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and cast ashes into the grove. The same measures were adopted with these courses of thase people who had previously dictated compyrism, 1 cst should, in turn, become upward agents of others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampire becomes a vampire himself, and sucks in turn.\nThe Chief Cliff.\nThe monstrous rodomontade is related to the horone, as it appears to be better suited to the subject matter of these observations than any other instance that might be produced. In many parts of Greece, he is considered to be a kind of punitive death of the plague, for a heinous crime was committed while he was in existence, that he is not only condemned to vampyria, but that he was forced to continue his unfornal visilations, so to those beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was put by ties of kinship and affection. — A supposition refers to the \"Giaour\".\nBut first, as Vampyre sent him, thy corsus shall be torn from his sepulchre; their haunts the place of origin, and sucks the blood of all thy seed; from thence of thy daughter, sister, ef, at midnight drains the stream of lifo; yet hate the banquet that strikes thy living corsus, thy victims, are yet expired, and are the devil for their sire; as thou cursest thyself, thou crushest them, your flowers are wilhered on the stein. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, will bless lhee with the name of a father — This word will wrap by hear in the flame! Yet, you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last bright look must see which freezes his blue without life; Tben in hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, De which, in life, a lock when the pledge the son of affection has been carried — But now is supported easily by the terminal of your agony! And yet, if you have your best drop of blood, your grinchy toe, your blazed lip; Théri tracking your bloody grave, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those in horror get away from Speclre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild but beclutisul poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampyrc course of the young Arablari Oneiza, who is reprimanded as having remurdered from the grave with the aim of tormenting him that she loved better during her life. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sinfulness of his life, being poured out throughout history as a complete type of purity and arnocity. The Veracieux Toumesort gives a logical account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyrism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of oncdotes, arid traditionalistic accounts illustrating its effects, helps presented some dissertations Iearned, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nMany curious and interesting opinions about this arduous superstition could be a ded; although the present does not suffice for the limits of a nate, necessarily devoted to the explanation, which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyrc is lhe onc in mosl general acceptance, there are several other syrionymovs with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Gul, Brocoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nSomething happened in the middle of the dissipation.\nIn a winter London, the leaders of the town appear to the various parties, a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. apparently, the scout of the fair drew only his attention, so that he could be a jeook stifle him, and throw fear into the chests where the carelessness reigned. These words felt the this sound of fear, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eyec, which, by staring at the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, arid to the sound of piercing through the inner workings of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead which weighed on the skin just could not possess. His peculiarities made HLM be invited to all houses; Oll wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to attract their attention. In the spitting of the mortal hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either from the blush of rnodity, or the strong emotion of passion, although they were the farm and the contours are fabulous, many feminal hunters after notoriety tried to gain his attention, and to gain, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had been the bony mocker every monster worn in drawing-rooms since her marriage, threw himself in his way, and did everything but put on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract his attention :— although in vain :— while she stood up to him, although the hif eyes were apparently fixed on her, still it seemed clear if they were not seen ;— even her inapplaudious impuderice was flouted, and she left the deficit. But even if common adultery could not influence even the guidaric of the eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferently yours: however, this was the apparent action with what he spoke to the uirtuous wife and the inriocent daughter, but little knew that he never addressed women. He had, however, the recognition of a winning language; and if it was there that he overcame the rhyme of his singular character, or that they moved by his apparent wreath of vice, he was also often among the Tbosque women who boasted of their sex of their domofistic virtues, as among those who shook her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, he came to London, a young gentleman of the noun of Aubrey: he fights with an orphan sister who lives in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself, too, by guards, who had a grim duty to take care of his fortune, they renounced the inore importarit of the bis spirit to the cleavage of servants mercenaries, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, a bonce, this romantic high feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruins the apprentices so many milliners. He believed that the voice was launched by Provance only for the picturosque effect of the scene, as we saw in the romances: he thought that the misery of a house was a simple consistency in the making of clothes, which were like worms, but that the witch was better suited to the painter's eye by their irregular folds and the various coloured stains. Such thought, in the end, that the dreams of photos were the realities of life. He was beautiful, sneaky and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the gay houses, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe with the least truth, their languishing or blushing favorites: the naughty at the same time, their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when opened his lips, soori led him into false notions of his stories and his merit. Attached as he was to the love of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in talk and the wax candles that flaked, not from the presence of a ghost, but lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life for any of these congreries of pleasant pictures and descriptions held in these volurns, from which he had formed his studies. Finished, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, who was about to give up his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above went through him in his career.\nHe observed it; he had the impossibility very to form an idea of the oharacler of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, which the sfender of the tacil to their exile, implemented by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed the object this as a hero type of romance, and determined to abserve the offspring of his fclncy, rather whom the person sat hiding. He met him, drew his attention, and until now advanced to his opinion, he has always been recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Rulhvens affairs were embarrassed, and he soon found, from the names of prayer in the street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of getting a little bit of information about this singular character, wbo, until now, had only aroused his curiosity, he suggested to his guards, that it was shot for him to make the tour, which for Many generations have been bought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick sleeps in the career of the vice to put themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to appear as if fallen from the sky tob, when the scandalous iritrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of competence manifested in the pursuit of learning. They consented: and A ubrey immediately mentioning his thoughts to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem on his part, but, apparently, bad nothing in common with other men, he willingly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Robertson's character, and now he found that, although much more of his actions had been exposed to his point of view, the results offered different conclusions of the apparent motivations to conduct bis. His companion was profuse in his liborality ;— be idle, the vagabond, and the beggar, received from the hand of this plus lhan enough to relieve their immodious desires. But they could not point out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the unfortunates who accompanied him, even on virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— these were the sneezes of the door with barely repressed sneezes; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his need, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to plunge him deeply into his inquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. However, he was attached by him to the largest unit of uicious time, which generally outweighed retired absenteeism towards the virtuous indigent. There was a circumstratory about the charity of her Lordship, which was even more impressed by her spirit: every lhose on whom he was best placed, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to scaffolding, or sunk to the west and the most abject misery. At Brvssels and in the other cities through which they passed, Auhrey was never taken to the apparent crowd with which his companion sought the cen tres of all the vices in fashion; there he entered into the irito the whole spirit of the table of faro: he bet, and always gclmblod successfully, except where the most clearly known was his antagonist, and then he lost even more than that he won; but it was always with the face of the immutable fame, with which he usually swept away the wisdom around: it was not, however, therefore, that he encountered the eruption young novice, or the father without chance of a great family; their very desire seemed for a very good reason the law — this apparent abstraction of the mind was ruled out, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat whipped with the half-de mouse. In every city, he left the formerly rich youth, torn from the circle being adorned, ours, the solitude of a drained, the fate that had Tirri hirn within the reach of this friend; while many father sat frantic, in the midst of the airs talking of silent hungry children, without a single farthing of his last immense wealth, where lobuy even sufficient to satisfy the jr prefend. But he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guard that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this punishment and pleasure which proved the rule of AlI, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he dilated it — for on the day he hoped that his friend would give him a certain opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, it never worked. The Lord Ruthven in his corsage, and amalgamating various wild and rich scenes of nature, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey waf laughed at the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratitude for him than the tough excitement of vainly desire to break that myslery, who to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of supernatural something.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost sight of his captain; he left the home in daily presence until the morning circle of the Italian Countess, as he went in search of memorials of an almost deserted city. The first was of his sister, breathing nothing, the others were of his guardians. The latter surprised him; if he had already entered into his imagination that there was evil power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on his immediate departure from his friend, orid, exhorted him, that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of religious powers of seduction, made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. It was found wrong, that bis connivence for adultery had not origirized in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratification, that the victim, the associate of his guilt, should be thrown from the pinnocle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation on: in the end, that all the ferns he had sought, apparently on the doorstep of their virlue, had, since his departure, cast the mask itself, and had not burned to expose all the distortion of their victors to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose character had rioted congratulated a single luminous pinl one that to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for the complete abandonment of the bill, and to monitor it more closely and not to allow any slight circumstances to pass. He entered the same circle, arid quickly perceived that his Lordship tried to work until the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to be met in society; so he was obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discovered that an assignment had been designated, which would most likely end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Without wasting any time, he took away Lord Ruthuen's apartment, and suddenly asked two of her intentions with respite from the lady, informing her at the same time that he was aware of his being about to meet her that night. Lord Ruthvon woke up, that his intentions were such that so-called everything would have had on such an occasion; and at the time of being preferred if he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey withdrew, and, no doubt, wrote a note, to say, that from that moment on, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the taur proposed by Tbeir, he ordered a servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only about his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The attendance has been warned. Lord Ruthven, the next day, was content to attack his servant to warn his full ascent of a separation; but did not mention any suspension of his plans having been thwarted by Auhreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Aubrey directed his sleep to Greee, and crossed the peninsula, and soon found himself in Athenf. He then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care to trace the faded archives of ancient glory on monuments which, apparently, shameful timing of the acts of free men only before slaves, had hidden ceaselessly under the sheltering self or many olorous lichen. Under the same roof itself, there existed being, so beclutiful and delicate, that she could seize the model of a painter who wanted to spread on canvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, savo that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that one could think that she could belong to the other what no souls. As such danced on the plateau, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have brought the ga2elle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have expended his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look asleep of the animal adapted blue to the last of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for antiquities, ond oflen would the uriscient girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere buttersly, showed all the beauty of its form, floccating as it was upori wind, to lock it eye of him, who forgot this milkcrs it comes from decypherod on an almost stunning tablet, iri the pretemplement of his figurc sylpha-like. Often her braids would fall, as she wilted around, exbibit in the ray of the sun so delicately brillianl and swistly fading huos, it might well excuse the oblivion of the antjquarian, who let escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe charms that everyone feels, but that no one can appreciate ?— He wasinnocenco, young, arid because they, not afloated by crowded drawing roams and stifling balls. As he drew these remains of which he wanted to keep a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, and swept away the magical effects of his pericil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she then described him the circular dance on the open fold, painted, to him in all the brilliant colours of the youthful memory, the point of husband whom she remembered from viewing in her infancy; and then, turning to subjects who had obviously made an impression of graft on his mind, blew him all the supernatural tales of his nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused the very interest of Avbrey; and often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years in the midst of her fries, and her most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the lifo of a female l ovely to prolong her existence for the ensuing monlhs, her holood ran cold, while he began to laugh at these idle and horrible fantasies; bvt Ianthe quoted her the names of the old men, who had finally detected an amng living themselves, after several of their close relatives and their children had been drunk with the buffer of the appetite of the friend; and when shc found him so jnrcdulous, shc baggé af him Believe it, for it had been pointed out that those who had dared to question their existence had always had a given proof, which required them, with mourning and agitated heart, to confess that he was lure. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her horror spell became more pronounced, hearing a rather precise descriptor of Lord Ruthven; however, he still persisted on stinging it, still could not be the truth in his fears, though at the same time wondered about many coincidences that all tend to excite an elect in Lord Ruthvens superriatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, contradicted by all the offended virtues of women among wham, he had fought for the vision of a man wig of English habits, marrying a Greek uneducated, rising still more and more clinging to the almost magical form before him. It would sometimes tear itself from it, and, forming a plon for the Antiquarian Care Resoarc, would be depclrt, determined not to return until his attention will reach; but hc always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while iri his mind preserves on the image that only scemed the legitimate possession of his dolphins. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, arid has never been so frank incontile being that he had known for the first time. Sbe always seemed to separate from him with reticence; hut it was because she no longer had a single wall that she could follow her favorite hauntments, while her guardian was occié in the skelchirig or discover some fragment which had yet escaped from the hand destructive of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of the companies, and both, with several parents, refined their existence, the pale of horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Auhrey decided to go on one of his excursions, which was to leave him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they rushed both to beg him not to come back at night, because he necessarily went through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, after the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the result of the vampyr in their nocturnal orgies, and advanced the heaviest movies as imminent on the one who dared to cross the path of the third. Auhrey made the light of their representations, and tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when they saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, of which very riamo apparently made their freezed blood, he was silent.\nThe next day, Morniring Aubrey celebrated his excursion without lingering; Bo was surprised to obsess the salty melancholy of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the bcliff of these horrific...\nThe Devils had inspired them to terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and earnestly pleaded with him for a return, and night passed the power of these beings to be spent in food ;— he promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not see that the daylight was coming to an end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warrior climates, so quickly assembled in a huge class, lingered in pouring all their fury upon the devolved land .— He finally, bowed down, climbed horse-by-horse, determined to catch up with the speed of his delay; but he was at 0 late. The twilight, in these southern climates, is quite unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins: and he had advanced far. The storm's power was abouous — his stranded thurders were afraid of an interval of rest — his heavy heavy rain forced his way into the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fly and radiate at his feet. Suddenly, his horse got scared, and he was carried with terrible speed to the entangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue,\npped, and he found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hospital that was not up from the masses of dead leaves and a brush that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that to find one to guide him to your down, or at least trust any shelter from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the draconian shrieks, which mingled with the suffocated and exulting mackerel of laughter, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was set in motion: but, excited by the thunder that rolled again on his hoof, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. It sounds in total darkness: the sound, however, guided it. He was apparently impressed; for, although he called, always the continuous sounds, and no remark of him was taken. He found bimsels in contact with someone, whom he seized immediately; when a volce shouted ,\"Again baffled!\" to whom a laughter of glimmer succeeded; and he felt overwhelmed by a man whose strength seemed superhuman: deceitful to sell his life as hard as he could, he read; but it was in vain: he was lifted from his feet and yelled with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw 1 f upon him, and knelt on his heart, had laid hands on his throat — when the glare of several torches penetrated through the hole that was gravying in the day, disturbed him ;— he rose up instantly, hung himself, leaving his prey, rushed to the door, and in an instant the crushing of the branches, cls ho broke through the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, incapable of moving, was soori heard by those who were not. They attract themselves; the light of the torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw of heavy flavor of soil. To the desire of Aubrey thycy scarleted for her who had attracted him by his cries; to be again left in darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torch was more bursl on him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conducter brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, mocking that it was only a vision from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, when he shut them, fainting by his side. There was no colour on his cheek, not even at the top of his lip; but there was a silence about his thal face seemed almost lacking as the life that once lived there :— on the ber neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were marks of teeth having opened the vein :— for the pointed men, ring, simultaneouslystruok with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly cultivated, and Avbrey was laid beside her who, at the end of the year, was the object of so many visions of bright and fairies, now fallen with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what his thoughts were — his mind was a benumbé surd vuined to shun reflection, and toke front on vacation — he almost unconsciously held in his band a nack dagger from a partlcular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were quickly met by different parties who had been engaged in the search for a mother's house inside. Their lamentationable weeping, as they approached the city, warned the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"To describe the sorrow of the child would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's debauchery, they looked looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards Corsica .\" They are irreconsolable; both died in a drunken state.\nAvbrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was osten delusional; at regular intervals he called Lord Ruthven and the Iclnthe – by an unbelieving combination he seemed to be begging his companion before saving the being he loved. At other times, he refrained from imposing millions on his head, and cursed him as a destroyer chair. Lord Ruthven, at random at the hour this also arrived at Athera, and, for whatever reason, on the taking over of the state of Aubroy, immediately placed himself in the same house, and became his co-\n- A police officer. When he retracted his delivery, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him of whom he now had the image of a Vampyre; but Lord Ruthveri, by his kind words, almost implored the repugnance for the fault that evil used their separation, and even more so by the attention, anxiety and care he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it seemed only the apathetic being that had so surprised Avbrey; but soon he held his brain convalescence to be quick, he gradually removed into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference with the old man, except the thal to the time, he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed intensely on him, with a strile of malignant exutation playing on the bis lips: he knew not why, but this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the recovery of the invalid, Lord Ruthven was happy....\nLooking at the waves without a tide raised by the coo-\nLing breaks, or by marking the progress of these orbs, circles, like our world, the sun without movement ;— in fact, he seemed to want to aroidate the eyes of all.\nThe spirit of Aubrey, by this shock, was very weak, and this elasticity of spirit which had once so distinguished this news seemed to have fled forever. Ho was now like muoh, a lover of solitudo and silence like Lord Ruthven; but although he desired him for sollude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he had once frequented, Ianthe formed stood by his side — if he had seen him in the woods, his light step would seem to ask himself to amalgamate the underwood, seeking in the violet of the model; then suddenly to turn rombid, would show, to his wild imagination, pale hcr face surdwounded tbroat, with a sweet smile on his li ps. He decided to steal the scenes, each of which has created such associations of mordus in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he held him bound by the tender care which he had washed of him during his illness, that they did not visit these parts of Greece or yet have a season. They traveled in the arduous direction, and they searched for each place to whip a memory could be attenuated; but, although they thus haunted from one place to another, they seemed to be laughing at what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but gradually they hesitated to minimize these relationships, which they imagined to be the invention of individuals, whose plot was to incite the generosity of those they defended against the prolonged dangers. Because of this negligence on the part of the inhabitants, on one occasion they traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides of class than as a defense e. Upan entering, Howcver, a narrow defilure, whose boltome was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of racks descended from the neighboring precipios, they had reasoried to repent of neglect; for they barely carried the whole part engaged in the narrow collar, when they were surprised by the whistle of bullets near their heads, and by the ec hoed report of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, standing behind the rocks, had a gun to sire in the direction from which the game came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the turning sheltering from the bottom: but shameful being bones thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, shouted advarice to them, and being exposed to the slaughter without mercy, if one of the should climb thieves above and take at the back, they immediately decided to rush in search of the enemy. They had barely lost the Tbe shelter of rock, when Lord Ruthuen received a shot in the shoulder of the thc, who brought a bim to the ground. Aubrey hastened to his asphyxiation; and, no longer spreading the contest or his own peril, was soon surprised to see the faces of the thieves around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvenf. being wounded, immediately threw their arms and surferoded.\nBy the promises of a great corner, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and agreeing on a collision, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they simply kept the entrance until their comrade should return with the smoke promised, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthven quickly diminished; two days of martification followed, and death seemed to trigger with those they not. The conduct and appearance of Hjs had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain that had been objects around him: but towards the end of the last evening, hls inind bocam apparently badly, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his donkey with more than the habit of pillowing —\"Assist me! You can save Mc—you can do more than that — I don't remember my life. I listened to his death as little as that of the past day; but you can save my good, the good of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? \" I need a little opacity in my life. I cannot explain all this, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free from the mouth of the world, and if my death was long unknown in England, I — but life. \"—\"It must not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the man dying, rising up with exulting violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your fear, that for a year and a day you will not pass on your knowledge of my children to any living being, whatsoever, it may be.\na pen, or whatever that you can see. \"- His eyes weaken from their bases :\" I swear !\" sound Aubrey, he lay on his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but did not let go; many circumstances attributed knowledge with thif rnan rose upon his mind, and he knew why nat; when one remembers his oats, a cold shivering came upon him, as if he stomped the present of the same horrible thing waiting for a bim. Rising at the beginning of the year, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and informed him that he was no longer there, having been transported by his sons and companions, at his retreat, to the top of the nearby mountain of cl, according to a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the cold ray of the fir of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey deafened herself, and took several of the men, decided to bury him on the spot where he was. But when he had climbed to the top, he found no trace of the corpse or clothes, the thieves warned, they reported the ideritical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, if the mind was perplexed in conjectures, he finally came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the good of the clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in which all would seem to rise as the superslitic melancholy which had raised his mind, he decided to leave her, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to take him to Otranto, or Naples, he sailed to organize the cafés he had with him belonging to Lord Rulhven. Among other things, there was a case containing several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to ensure the mourning of victory. There were several daggers and attractions. As he examined their forms of curiovs, which was his surprise to find a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fotal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon of Tbe, and his horror can be imagined that he discovered that it was equivalent, although in the form of insight, to the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes seemed to have no need of surmer, they seemed to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted to ignore; but the particular shape, then the varying shades on the shaft and sheath were dared as in the splendor on both, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his way to Hame in Roine, the first nquiries were about the lady whom he had tried to describe the arts stretch of Lord Ruthvon. Her parents were in distress, the fortune was wasted, she had not been heard since the departure of her 10th ship. Aubreys spirit became an alinose broke without such repeated horrors; he was afraid that this child had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He asked me to remain silent and remain silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postions, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held. He came to Calais; a sheep, who seemed to obey his will, soon to be thrown away by English; and he hastened to the abode of his fathers, and there, for a while, seemed to lose, in the shams and caresses of his sister, a memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman was beginning to appear, she was even more attached as a companion.\nMiss Auhrey had no great winning beat who won the goze and applauded the drawing-rooin sets. There was nothing like this light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the benefit spirit. There was a melancholic charm about it that did not seem to emerge from misfortune, but from a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not this light foot, which stra ys where to eat a butterfly or a color can attract — it was sedate and pen five. When alone, her face was never enlightened by the twinkle of joy; but when her brother breathed her effects, and would forget in her presence, these shouts that she knew how to destroy her rest, who could have exchanged her smile for that de the uoluary? It seemed that these eyes — this face then played in the light of the native sphere of the air. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought by herguordianf more appropriate that her presentation should be delayed until the return of a brother from the continent, that he could be his protector. That now, that is why, resolved that the next show, which was approaching, should be the time of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to take over his father's house, and feed on the melancholy that surpassed him. He could feel intimidated by the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his mind had been nourished by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own consolation in order to protect him from his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a drawing-roin.\nThe crowd was excessive — a living room had not been held for a long time, and all those who were anxious to rest in the kingship smile, rushed over him. Aubrey was there with her sister. When he was standing in a room by himself, without taking into account all that made him feel committed to the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in the same place — he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and a voice he recognized loo well, smiled in the ear bis —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn a spectre that would explore him, when he perceived, from a distance, the same figure that attracted his police to this place at the first entrance of the bis into society. He looked until his limbs fled almost to carry their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to leave a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was driven home. He trampled the photo room with buried steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he were afraid of his thoughts exploding from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him—cercences started in a terrible painting—thc dagger—his oath .— He woke up, he might riot that it was possible—the dead are resurrected again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image upon which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be real — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his tips, and he failed to get the information. He married a few times afterwards with his sister at the assembly of a close relationship. After leaving the Hor under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself his own covering talents. Finally, seeing that many were fainting, he awakened, and entered another room, quadrified his souls were surrounded by several, apparently in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned around, imagined to him these traits that he most abhorred. Hc went forth, shook his sister's arm, and, in haste, bowed down to the street; at the door he found himself hindered by the crowd of servants who were waiting for the lords of Tbcir; and while he was committed to passing them, he still barbuted that voice which murmured by him :\"Remember your oath !\"He dared not turri, but, pressing his sister, sowed at home.\nAubrey became dislocated almost. So if he had been absorbed by a subject, just was much more completely absorbed, now that the certainty of a monster living again on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she begged him to explain to him what had caused her unruly conduct. He spoke only a few words, and those who tortured her. The more he thought, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised him ;— was it then to bring down this monster to blush, bringing ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His sister may have been touched by him. Bvl kiln if it is a matter of breaking his oath, and does close his suspicions, who will believe him? He thought he would use his own hand to free the world from such a misfortune; but death, he remembered, had already been moked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his roar, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with eyes flowing with tears, took him, for her, to support nature. At 1st, rio longer capable of the calm of wild boar and sovilude, he left his house, wandered the street curly to troet, anxious to steal this haunted white image. His robe became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to the midnight damps. He was no longer to be recognized; he first returned with him at night to the house; but at last he laid him down to the rest where the satigue invaded him. His sister, anxious for the high safety, employed people to follow him; but they were soon disconcerted by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any – of thought. His conduct, however, suddenly harassed himself. Struggled by the idea that he left all his friends by hif absenoe, with a friend among them, whose presence they were not conscious, he decided to enter society in clgain, and to look at him as a closole, anxious of prewarn, in spite of his oath, that word. The Ruben approached with privacy. Bul entered a room, his suffocating and suffocating eyes shook, his inword shuddered so visible that his sister finally began to beg for her back to look for a society that so strongly affected him. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guardian had the right to intervene, and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they took the time to regain that trust that had been taken over by Aubreys parents before.\nDesiring to save him from the wounds and suffering he had encountered daily in his wonderings, desiring to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and took constant care of him. He hardly seemed to notice, if his mind completely was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence is finally so great that he was able to go to his room. There, he would lie for the days, unable to be awake. He had become, his eyes had stirred up a glass chandelier ;— there was only a sign of affection and memory that had manifested itself at the entrance of his sister; then he was going to start something, and, grabbing his hands, with looks that devouredly distressed, he wanted her not to touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, do your love love love me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he referred, if only the answer was :\"True !\" And once again, it sank into the cold state, from where not even if he could wake him up. It lasted many months: however, little by little, as the year was passing, its inconsistencies became less frequent, arid his mind to gratify with a portion of his morosity, while his guardians observed, that several times in the day to be counted on his fingers an infinite numbness, then smile.\nThis time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards tortoring his room, began to converse with his doctor about the melancholic circumstance of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, which his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately troubled; he asked whom anxiously that. Happy with this returnable intellect brand, which they feared had been deprived of, they deserved the name of The Earl de Marsden. Thinking of this young country whom he had met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished even more by his expressing intention to be present at the nuptials, and wishing to see his sister. They did not answer, but his sister was with him in a few words. He was apparently again able to be affected by the insluence of the beautiful smile hor; for he pressed her to the chest of half, and kissed his cheek, saddle with tears, flowing back through the thought of his brother boing once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all the hif wonted heat, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a Persian so distinguished for rank and each accomplished; when he suddenly pierced a medallion on his chest; open it, what was a surprise to the behodingles characteristics of the man who had influenced his life so long. It grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and pietina under the feet. On her asking him why he thus destroyed which reseinblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her — sojzing her hands, and looking upon her frantic expression of content, he told her to swear that she would never marry this monfter, because he — but he could not advanco — it seemed that this voice still made her remember her almond —he said southerly rovnd, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. In the average guards and physicists, who had kept the whale, arid took it away, was only a return to his trouble, entered, and Miss Aubreys forcing, disdained him to leave the hive. He fell on his knees from the bus to them. He implored, he hounded them within 0 but one day. They, attributing this to the insanity they imagined, had taken the possessian of his mind, and endured to pacify him, and retired.\nLord Rutbven had called the morning after the salon, and had been refused with all the worries. When he heard about Aubrey's health, being easily understood himself to be the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exulation and pleasure could hardly be correlated with those among which he had obtained this information. He hastened to welcome his predecessor, and, through assistance, and the claim of great affection for his brother and to enter his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Could I resist his power? His language had dangers and tolls to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having a rio sympathy with any being on the soothing earth, except with her to whom he addressed himself ;—could say how, as he knew her, his existence had begun to appear worthy of preservation, if it was merceously that which could listen to your soothing beer would come ;— in the end, he knew us how to use the art of the serpent, or such was the will to fot, that he won his affective. The title of the elder branch which fell to him in Lenglh, he obtained an important embassy, which served as a cause to haveten the marriage (in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ), which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for the pen and paper; it was given hlm; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, his own honor, and to be honorable of the grave now, who held him in their arms as their hope arid the hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours our marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest mo curses. The servants promised that they would deliver it; but by giving it to the doctor, he bought a better riot to harassing even more Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, greasing a maniac. The night passed without rest to the bully inmates of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that could more easily be concocted than described, well-filled preparation notes. The morning came, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. Curiously, if the servants lost their vigilance, they gradually took him away, leaving him in the custody of an old Helloss woman. He seized the opportunity, and one of them was out of the room, arid in a moment found himself in the almost assembled apartment where. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he immediately approached, and, taking his arm by force, cast him out of the rose, without a voice, with fury. When on the stairwell, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear —\" Remember your oath, I know, if it is not the day of my bride, your sister is dishonored. Women are fresh !\" So he pushed him to his companions, who, awakened by the old woman, had come to seek a job. Aubrey could support himself longer; his rabies finding no ventilation, had broken blood vessels, and it was passed to bed. This was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, because the doctor was awful to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and the husband left London.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of when approaching death. He wanted his sister's guards to be called, and if the hour of the night had struck, he would take back what the reader had perpetuated, he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubroy; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER, CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"Tho the world was in front of him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the archipelago of Grecjan, in the archipelago of Her Majesty, in the year 1812, we put into the port of MityIene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of shells and vegetables still to there, lead many British ships to visit it, both men of war and merchants; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrna, its amply repoy bonuses for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and as the men were used to water, and the bargaining handbag for cattle with the natives, the clergy. and I took a ramble at the c alled cave, Homers School, and other places, where we had been before. On the front of Mourit Ida (a small manuscript so named) we met with and changed a young Greek as our guide, who told us that he was coming badly with Sci0 with an English word, who left the island four days before our arrival in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said Groek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I tried to choose to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He has a strange man, a very good man. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge of him: he gauges Dominick, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 Curreney English ,) and has resided there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis story greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time enjoying the house where our countryman lived. We were kindly received by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spaced closet attached. They were all simply decorated: united green walls, marblo tables on the eitber side, a large bluertle in the centre of the tub, and a fountain of small below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of the tube of a small Bronze Venus in a posture of reading; a large sofa or sofa completed the furniture. There were half a dozen English dance chairs in the room, and a full-filled case book: there were no mirrors, nor finger painting. The bedroom simply had a large mattress lying on the floor, using two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow — the cammon bod fraghout Greece. In the living room, we observed a marble recreation. Once, the man told us, filled with books and papers, which were then in a large sailor chest in the closet: it was open, but we did not justify examining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, printed in Parma in 1810; the little pamphlets of the Greek press of Constantinoplo, much naked, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scribed everywhere, and marked gulfs of the poper spirit, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man said ,\"The lord had been sewing these books the tangle besor which he has said, and forgot to place them with both the others; but,\" he said ,\" they must lie his return there; for it is so porticular, that if I move a thing without order, it would frown me for a week to go further; it is moreover good. I did him a service, and I made the product of this farm far from the difficulty of dealing with it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenianri who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen broad, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and the chances of frel work ,( as it is now usual in the Greek archery ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surmounted by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a beautiful tile of Turkey, under a strong Corsican linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus surriched, the Greeks pass their vowings by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and enjoying the perpetual breeze.\nOn the left hand, we cleaned the house, a little strecllet slipped, grapes, oranges and lindens, we clustered together on the borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a seat of marhle with an ornamental wood back, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and about twelve hours, reading, writing, arid speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, in addition to Sunday .\"\nThe view of this seat was perhaps called \"a life of bird eyes\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Colcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decomposition. A small stream from the ruiris descended into broken waterfalls, it was lost in the wood near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon unshaded by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of high and palm chesriut, several small islands have been observed directly, spreading the blue wavelight with spots of green wind. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our investigations were unsuccessful close to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"Armenian\" said our leader ,\" Could say, I sure he won, he says, and you tell your friend, if I can, he says, I don't dare. We didn't have time to visit the Armenian, but in the afternoon back to the bass, we learned several particular of the isolate. He had shared eight young girlfriends that he was 1st on the island, and had even danced with the girls at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these articles. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it appeared to us, from all that we had gathered, to have was a very elegant and beneficial character. One circumstance we learned, that our old friend or cottage considered appropriate not to reveal. He had a very majestic daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use him.\nThese were the information with which we left from the island of Peaceful of Mityleno; our imagiriatioris everything on the rack, giving which this rambling in Greece could be. He had money, it was obvious: he had the disposition of philarithropy, on all these eccentric ideas that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greece ,\"The individual,\" sold him ,\" about who you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met in my travels on the island of Tenedos, I also lived in Mitylene.\" We had never heard of the fame of this lordship, as we had been a few years from home; \"Child Horolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the result of Calcla on each page. Did we regret not being more curious in our hillside petitions, but we became angry with the long idea of returning to Mitylene on the same day, but to me that day will never come back. I make this statement, believing that he is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the good name of his secretary, which has been grossly slandered. He described being an insensitive disposition, inverse to the association with human culture, or contributing to any ability to appease his grief, or add to his pleasures. The fact is directly inverse, as can be clearly collected from these credits a little. All the finest feelings of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bosom. tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness at the rest of the solution is an additional reason to mark him as a being whose heart Roliglon half sealed and whose pearl Benevolence threw away his coat. No man can read the preceding listening to \"trusts\" without feeling proud of him, a securityman. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. There are always relations with the cautiori, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of the man; and the one who dares to justify it is pointed out that the horrific court that everything must appear, only can censor the errors of the homos-mortai. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his geniuses. To do good in the dry, and to reject the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approval conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleetset.",
    "43": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based on so very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be commori n: just, however, does not extend to the Greeks if it is after the establishment of Christianity; and it has taken its present form only since the division of the Latiri and Greek churches; at the time which, the idea of becoming dominant, that the local Latin body could not corrupt so buried in their territory, it gradually increased, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful stories, up to 1, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the river and beauty. In the West, with a certain variation in ligature, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the beief existed, the vampyres at nightly soaked a certain porlion of Tbe blood from their victims, which became emaciated, lost the strength of Tbeir, arid died quickly from consumption; while these fattened human blood suckers — and their becamo veins dissolved to such a state of repletiori, in order to cause the blood of all to flow through the bodies, and even the pores themselves from their skins.\nIri, the London Journal, of Mareh ,1732, is a curious, and, of course, credible, on a particular case of vampyrism, which is blocked for having taken place in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the Place de Tbe, that it has been consistently asserted, that about five years before, a certain Heyduke, named Arnold Poul, had heard said that, in Cassovla, on the borders of the Turkish Seruia, he had been torried by a varpyre, but had found a way to get rid of the spoon, by eating the ring part of the earpiece of the tomb of the vampyre, on rubbing himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from becoming a human vampy; for about twenty or thirty days after his declemation and burial, many people complained of having a hoen tormented by him, and the aposllion was made, that the child sour people were deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent even more malice, the inhabitants who hated consulted their Hadagni, up to work in the body, and found just (as it is assumed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely ash corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, arid ears, pure arid florid blood. The having evidence was therefore abtclinated, he resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was completely pushed through Arnold Club's home and body, where he is a reporter for shouting so terribly as if he had been alive. And they cut off his head, and burned his body, and cast the ashes into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the forces of those people who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, like their tour, become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre arrives a vampyre himself, and sucks in turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomoritade is linked here, because it seems better adapted to illustrate the subject of the observa-\nThere are no other factors that could be invoked. In many parts of Greece, it is believed as a kind of punishment after death, for the same heinous crime committed while it existed, that the deceased is not only given to vampyriso, but is forced to consinute his infernal visitolions as well as to those beings he loved the most widely upon earth — those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A supposition widespread in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as cmpyro sent, thy corse shall be torn from his tomb; and then shall haunt the native land, and suck blood with all thy sack; from thence of thy daughter, fister, wifo, about midnight drain the street of life; yet loclth the banquet that performeth shall feed thy livid living corfe, thy victims, are they yet exhaled, Shalje know the devil for their sire; as thou cursedst them, thy flowers are wretched upon the stem. But whoever for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best beloved of all, Shalje blessed Ihee with the riam of a father — This one will wrap your heart in flame! Yet you have put an end to your task and marked the last tint of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last glaze of glass must see who releases his lifeless blue; Then, with the hand without Halloween will tear the braids of his yellow hair, of which, in life a lack of wben shornThe tenderest commitment of Affection has been worn — But now is worn away by the memorial of your clgonia! Yol with your own best blood will flow; Tby grinning tooth, and hagards lip; Then stalking at your sullin fall, Go – and with Gouls and Afritsrave, until those in horror shrink away from the more cursed spectrum than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced into his wild but beautiful poet of \"Thalaba\", the vampyre Corsica of the Arabianwelness Oneiza, who is represented as having returned from the grave with the aim of tormentiring help that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be posed for having resulted from the sinfulness of her life, she being pulled away through the whole of history as a complete type of purity and innocence. The vorcious Tovrnefort gives a long story in his lives of amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, iri his great work upon thif fubject, besides a variety of anecdotes, arid traditionalistics illustriative effects, put by far some learned dissertations, harassing to prove it to be a ssical cla, as well as the barbaric error.\nMany curious and interesting opinions or this singularly horrible superstition could be odd; though the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily devolved to explanation, arid that can now be concluded by inerly remarking, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of iri different parts of the world: like Vrovcolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt was in the midst of the altendant dissipations of a London winter that the various porties of the ton chiefs appeared a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He was watching the milk around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apprenticely, the light laugh of the fair drew his attention, so that he could by cold look at the calm, and throw the fear into those breasts where carelessness risen. Those who felt this feeling of color, could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and suddenly to percent through the iriward work of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skiri it could not pass. His peculiarities led him to be enlisted in every house; everyone had fun seeing him, and those who had been accustomed to vilerit ex citation, and now it is the misfortune of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence able to engage attention. In spite of the deadly hue of her face, while neuer acquired a warmer hue, either running away from the blush of modesty, or from the strong tybe einolion of passion, although her sorine and its contours were beautiful, many female hunters tried to win her tauntians, and to win, at least, some marks of what they might call affection: Lady Mercer, who had drunk the mockery of every monster worn in the sineo drawing rooms her marriage, threw her herself into her way, and did everything except put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract her opinion :— although in vain :— where she kicked herself in front of him, tough her eyes were apparently fixed on her, yet it seemed that thoy were unperceived impudence was flouted, and she left field. But the adultery of the cominon could not influence even the greed of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to hiin: that such was the action appendel with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few ever knew that he addressed him to the females. He had, however, the reputation of a winning language; and while it is true that he even aborted fear of its singular character, or that they were moved by its appearance of hatred of the vice, he was also often among women who boasted of their sex from their domestic virtues, as clamoring those whom they ate by their vices.\nAt about the same time, Thero came to London, a young man of the name of Aubrey: he was an organ 1ft with a single sister in possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left to himself by the guardians, who thought that it was their responsibility simply to take care of his fortune, while they abandoned the most important burden of his mind, that of taking care of mercenary subaltorns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He therefore had romantic feelings of honor and frankness, which destroyed so many apprentices every day. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and thought that voice was thrown iri by Pretoria simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we soe in Romanoes: he tants that the misery of cottage simply consisting in the jacket of clothes, which were also hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and various patches colored. He says, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. It is beautiful, franicist and rich: for these reasons, upori its entry into gay circles, rnany mathers surraunded hirn, striuing whoh bould describe a truth with languishing or roaring fauovrites: the girls at the same time, by their mishaps when he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened hls lps, soon led him to false notions of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hours, was surprised to find a song, that, with the exception of iri, the tallow and wax candles that clicked, not of the presence of a ghost, but of the war of sniffing, there was no foundation in real life. for none of these congreries of pleasant pictures and disseptions bounded in these volumes, from where he had formed the study of the hls. However, finding some compensation for his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dreams, which was the extraordinary being we have described above, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave a few other signs of his observatory of external objects, which he tacitly clings to their existence, implored by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine everything that slattercd his propensity to extravagant ideas, he quickly formed this object into le bero of a romance, and determined to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He learned with him, paid him attention, and, until now, advanced in his opinion, that his presence was always recognised. Little by little, he learned that Lord Ruthveri's case was broken, and he soon found, from the notes of the preparation on the street, that he was about to travel. Desjrous of gain some information respect this singular character, which, until now, had only struck his curiosity, he lent to his tutors, it was time for him to persorm the tour, which for many generations has been thought necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the corner of vice-lows putting thcmsolves on an equculty with the old, and not allow them to appear as if fallcn from heavens, whenever the fcandal intrigues are mentioned as subjects of plisclency or praise, according to the degree of skill they had to carry them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intention to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a morque of esteem of him, who, apparently, bad anything common iri with other men, to be glad adly accepted, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Ruthven, and now he has found, that, tangb much more of his acts have been exposed to the sight of hls, the results have offered different conclusions of his apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was proper in his liberality ;— the lazy, the vagclbond, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to re...\nGive them their immediate needs. Bul Auhrey could not avoid notice, that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the seated misfortunes euen on virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with sneezes barely repressed; bvt when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent back to the spirit of rich charity. This rainbow falls, attributed by him to the greatest importance of the vicious, which would generally prevail on the retreat chest of the virulent needy. There was a circumstance about the charity of his Lordsbip, who was even more impressed upwards with his inirid: all those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the soaffold, or sunk at the lowest and the most abject surgery. In Brussels and other through lowris that they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent exasperation that his companion sought for the centers of all fusbionnable vices.\nHe bet, and has always played successfully, except where the best known was his colonagonist, and then he lost even more than he won; but he has always been with the immutable lazy face, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met you, he erupted-\nnovice, or unlucky father has a numeroouf family; then if everybody wishes to secede the law of fortune — this abstract concept of the mind was set aside, on his eyes glittered with more fear than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, cursed, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fact that had drawn him inside the mass of this flotilla; there were many father sitting frantic, in the midst of the airs talking mute and hungry children, with a whole piece of land at his late friendship, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yet he does not look like money from the game; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last guilder he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: this could but be the result of a roughertain of knowledge, which, however, was not capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to denounce him to his friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which he proved to be ruining of all, the client did not take care of his own profit ;— but he delayed him — for whenever he hoped that his friend would give him the opportunity to speculate frankly and openly to him; however, this never dared. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and in the midst of the valour of the wild and rich scenes of nature, was always the same: his eyes spoke less than his iip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain any more gratification from him than the constant excitatory to want vainly to break this mystery, which to his imaginative exaltation began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey were soon adorned in Rome, and Aubroy lost for a while the sigh of his companion; he left him in daily presence until the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went into the sea of memorials of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters irritated from England, which he opened impatiently; the first came from his sister, breathing nothing of affection but; the others came from his guardians, the latter astonished him; if he had before entered his imagination that there was bad power in his companion, they seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guards insisted on leaving his friend immediately, and urged that his character was terribly vicious, for the possessor of irresistible power of seduction, made his licentious habits swear dangerous to society. He had been disembodied, and his contempt for adultery had no origin in the hatred of his character; but he had demanded, for enhanced bis gratification, that his uictim, the associate of his guilt, be cast out from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, all the women whom he had sought, apparently had not, since his departure, cast the mask even apart, and had not scrupulously-\nIt has led to exposing the total deformity of their voices to the public.\nAubrey determined on leaving one, whose character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. Hc resolved to invent a pretext of a place to abandon it completely, by seeking, in a wise sense, to do it closer, and not to allow any light circumstances to pass by nonnounced. He entered the same circle, and soon realized that his Lordship was trying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, whose main care he was dealing with the house. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is encountered in society; he has therefore hligaged to continue his plan in secret; Aubreys eye falsified him in all his windings, and soon discovered that the ari assignment had been supplemented, which would probably be lost in the ruin of an innocent girl, though thought 1. Without losing any time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and suddenly asked him for his intention of respect to the lady, informing him at the same time that he was aware of his being about to calm down at night. Lord Ruthven became inflamed, that his intentions were subb class he assumed that everything would have on such an occasion; and after being pressed when he intended to marry him, simply laughed. Aubrey retired; and, immediately writing no e, to say, that from that time, he must refuse to accompany his lordship in the rest of their proposed day, he ordered a bis servant to search for other apartments, and called the mother of the lady, informed his of all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also about the character of his lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Both The next day Ruthven simply sent his servant to notify his complete consent to a separation; but he did not suggest that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey went to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, found himself called Athens. He set up his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of drawing the erased records of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful of chronic jng the acts of Freoineri only before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many eloured lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, which could have formed the model away a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of being flithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that his eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she could help those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, oria would have thought the gazelle a type p0 or its beauties; for whom would have exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of an animated noir, for a luxurious sleeping bottle look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. Ananthes light step often accompanied Aubrcy in his search for antiquities, and after would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a Kashmere butterfly, showing all the beauty of his form, as he was on the wind, to the ardour of him, who forgave the letters that he had just dropped on an almost erased tablet, in the contemplation of his figurative sylph. Often, her braids would fall, if she wilted, would display in the shades so bright and so quickly weakening of the antiquarian, he might well excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let her mind simmer the object before thinking of the vital importance to the proper interpretation of a passage in Spanish. But why try to denigrate the charms while feeling, but no one can appreciate ?— He calls innocence, youth, and beauty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. As he drew the remains of which he wished to keep a memorjal for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magic effects of his pencil, plotting the scenes of the native land ber; she would then describe to hjm the circular dance on the plain ocon, painted, lo he in all the dazzling eolours of the youthful memory, the marriage pop she remembered vibrating in her childhood; and then, turning los subjects who had obviously made a greater impression on the ber spirit, told bim ail the supernatural tales of the nurse ber. Her fervour and her belief in what she was telling, aroused the very greatest of Aubrey; and often as she told her the story of this vain living father, who had spent years in the midst of her friends, and dear bonds, forced everyone, feeding on the life of a pretty woman to prolong her existence of the erising months, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh out of the idle sucking and drinking fantasies; but Ianthe quoted her the dwarfs of the old men, who at last discovered one living among them, a severol behind their relatives' appetite; an arid wheri that she found so incredulous, that she had always found a bit so incredulous that she had confessed that she had it. She detailed him the traditional aspect of these monsters, and her horror was increased, with a rather acovrate description of Lord Ruthven; he, archaic, persisted on persuading her, that thero could not be the truth in her fears, although at the time sarne he wondered about the coincidences rnany which had all tended to excite a belief in the supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to ancient; his innocence, so contrasted by the offoeoted virtues of the women among whom he had sought to have fun, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without due, he found himself even more bimbotinated to the almost fairy-like form before him. He was tearing her bimselsat times, and, sleeping a plari far from some antiquarjan rescarch, who would go, decided not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, when iri his mind, he retained a shot image seemed alone the possessor of the right of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same frank child he had first known. She moved away from him with lucidity; but it was that the heavens should no longer have anyone with whom could not visit his favorite hauntings, that his guardian was busy at sketehiring or to discover a fragment that had still dared to destructive lime hand bones. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and both, with several present, affirmed the existence of TBE, pale with horror in the name itself. Soon, Aubrey decided to make one of the excursions of this, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all begged him both not to come back at night, since he had to pass through a wood, that no Greek ever reborn, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of vampires in their nocturnal orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imperative on the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrcy saw the representatives of Jr, and tried to laugh at them at the idea; but when he saw them trembling, his audacity to mock himself in this way with a superior, infernal power, the very name of the very name which, apparently, was freed from blood, was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and worried that the bi-words, mixing the belief of these horrible proud, could inspire them with such a terror. Ianthe, whom he took care of, came to the side of his horde, and went forth fervently with him to avenge himself, and at night lifted up the power of these beings to be put into action ;— which promised. He was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of the thase spocks which, in the warmer climates, quickly gathered upon a mass of tromendous, and poured all their rage over the devoted country .— He, however, mounted his horse, determined to make vp by the speed for his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in the southern climates, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it had advanced far, there was above the storm, the echoes of thunders had barely a interval of rest, its thick rain forced its way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue highling seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was carried with a terrible speed through the wood set in motion. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, by the glare of bone, that it was in the vicinity of a bowl that did not rise from the masses of shredded leaves and a brush that surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping that someone would guide him to the city, or at least shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thunder, for a silent moment, allowed him to raise the terrible screams of a woman who was mingling with mockery, exulting and mocking a laugh, continued in an almost irrigated bourbier ;— he was surprised; but, excited by the thurder who, once again, was rolling on his head, or, with a sudden effort, forcod opened the door of the hut. It was found in total darkness: the sound, however, guided them. It seems that he was not perceived; sorry, tough, he called, still sounds countered, and no advice was taken from him. He found himself in contact with someone who he immediately seized; when a way cried out ,\" Again bafsled !\" He felt struck by orians whose strength seemed superhuman: dissuaded from selling the life of bis as dearly as he could, he struggled; he read against him in vain; he rose from his feet tight with enormous force against the ground; his enemy threw himself on a bim, and knelt on his chest, had laid his hands on his sling; when the glorch of many torches penetrating into the hole that fills the light in the day, disturbed hjm ;—he rose up instantly, and, throwing his prey, cast down the door, and in a moment the crushing of the branches, as he was breaking the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still now; and Avbrey, unable to move, was soon heard by those WITHBUT. They entered, the light of their lords spread on the walls of the mud, and the tooth loaded on the eueri individual fraw with heavy soft flakes. To the desire of Os Aubrey, they sought her who had struck him with his cries; he was again afraid to sink; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, behold, perceive the angry form of his beautiful tanned conductor in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his disturbed imagination; but he saw again the same forrn, when he unlocked them, extended by the whole side. There was no color on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on his face that seemed alinosl as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and vpon his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this men pointed, wept, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was formed quickly, and Aubrey was laid on the side of the chair who recently asked him for the object of so much bright and fiiryuisions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died within it. Ho did not know that his thoughts carried a whale, his mind was inflamed and seemed to flee the reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy, he held unconsciously almost in the hand, bis a bare dagger of a parlicular construction, which had been found in the cabin. The theory was soon met by various parties who had been engaged in the search for a chair that a mother had missed. Their lamentable cries, as they approached the city, would prevent the parents from the terrible catastrophe. — To describe their grief would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, arid, poached at the course. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey bcing put to bed walls seized with the most violent fever, and was often delicious; in these intervals he was going to the otter on Lord Ruthven and vpon Ianthe — by some unaccourable cambination, he began to beg for his former companion to spare him from being loved. At other times, he permeated the calculations on the head of the bird, and cursed the hive as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Athens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the Aubreys slate, immediately placed his son in the same house, and embodied his constant companion. When he roused his delirium, he was horrified and scattered in the sight of him whom he had tied with that of a Vampyre; but the Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, almost repented of the fault which had caused their separation, and even more so by the intention, the anxiety, and the care which he showed, soon reconciled him to his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soori as his convalescence numbed to be fast, he gradually removed the same state of mind from the irito, arid Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the former man, except that he was sometimes surprised to meddle his gaze firmly fixed on him, with a smile of insulting exultation playing on his lip: hc did not know why, but this smile haunted. During the last stage of the invalid, Lord Ruthvcn seems to commit himself to watching the tideless waves rising the cool breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, circumcise, like our world, the sun without revitise ;— in fact, it seemed wise to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubrey's mind, by the shock of this, was greatly weakened, and this spirit of elasticity which had once so distinguished since it now seemed to have fled forever. He was now as fond of solitary silence as Lord Ruthven; but just as he had heed for solitude, his spirit, would not firid in the quarter of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the vines which he had previously frequented, the shape of Ionthe stood near his sidec – if he was looking for him in the wadf, his step of light seemed wandering in the undergrowth, in the quest for the purple modcst; then suddenly would turn around, show, to his wild imagination, his face of pclle and wounded tbroclt, with a sweet smile on his lips hor. He has decided to steal scenes, each of which has created the associations subb better in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he held himself bound by the tender care which he had taken of him during the holy ilries, that they could not visit these parts of Greece nor had they yet seen. They traveled in the direction of the Eury, and sought each place to remember a memory; but although they were in a hurry from place to place, they seemed to ignore the whale they were looking at. They heard a lot of robbers, but they began grooving these relationships, which they imagined were only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of those that they defended against alleged dangers. Curiously, neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, they once traveled with a few guards, more to serve as guides rather than guides. When entering, however, a narrow defilement, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torch, with large masses of rocks descended into the neighbor precipices, they had a reason to repent their nogligence; for hardly was the whole type of the party engaged in the narrow collar, when it was starred by the whistling balls of near the head, and by the ratio echo of several cannons. In a number of them, the guards had them, and, complaining behind the rocks, had begun to fire in the direction when the report came. Lard Ruthuen and Aubroy, imitating their copy, stopped for a moment behind the turning sheltered from defilement; but shameful to be thus detained by an enemy, who, with no knowledge of the sade them, shuls, advanced, and to be exposed to a massacre without resistance, if one of the thieves were to ascend above and take them into the reor, they immediately decided to rush into the sea of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the rock of Tobe, when Lord Ruthven received a schist in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer holding his help or his own circle, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on Lord Ruthvens wounded, immediately sunk their arms and surrender.\nBy the promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon urged them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and after accepting a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence, since there was only to keep the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had a bad order. Lord Ruthvens strength declined rapidly; in two days the rnortification followed, and Death seemed to move forward quickly. His coriduct and apprehension had not changed; he seemed as incoherent in the pain as he had been objects that accompanied him; but towards the end of the evening, the bis spirit became at ease, and the bis eye often set on Aubrcy, who was introduced to offer his help with more seriousness than usual — Assist me! I mean, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need only a little, my life ebbs apace, I can explain the whole, but if you know it well, my honor was fréo de la spot in the mouth of the world, and if my death was known for some time at England, I — but life. e :\"We will not know it .\" \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, rising himself with exultary violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swearing it, for a year and a day you will have no knowledge of my crimes or of every living being in any way whatsoever, in any way whatsoever, or whatever you may see. \" His eyes seemed to burst with their socks :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he mocked his pillow and no longer breathed.\nTo the brey withdrew to rest, but did not move; the many circumstances that were present at his knowledge of this man arose upon his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a trembling oam upon him, as if the presentation of horrific something awaited him. The ear rising late in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body, when a thief met him, and made him hear that he was no longer there, having was transmitted by himself and the comrades, on his reliri ng, to the pirinaclo of a nearby outside, according to a p promise, they had given his seigneury, that he ejected to the first cold ray of the moori thal rose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes several bones, the men decided to go and bury in the place where he was. But, queri which had died on your top to find no trace of either body or clothes, although the thieves swore that they reported the idenlic rock on which they misposed the body. For some time, his mind was shaken by conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they buried the corpse in the love of clothes.\nWeary of a country in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heighteri that the superstitious melancholy that had seized his mind, to be determined to leave her, and saon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a vessel to pass it on to Otranto, or to Naples, he took care of rounding up the effects he had with him by begging Lord Rulhven. Among other things, there has been the corruption of several weapons of offence, more or less adapted to the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, which was his surprise to find a gerbe apparently adorned in the same foot as the dagger disappeared in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to get a stealth proof, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined that he discovered that he was equivalent, although especially shapod, to the sheath he held in the hand of this. His eyes seemed not to need further certainty – they tried to look to be bound to the dagger; but he still wanted not to believe; but the particular sorme, the variable shades of the samc on the shaft and the sheath were also like in the splendor on the bottom, and left no noise for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his phone path, in Rome, the first investigations were about the lady he had tried to remove seductive arts from Lord Robert. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not heard the bone since the departure of her secretary. Aubrey Mirid became the broken almost under so many repeated executioners; he was afraid that this lady had falsified a victline at the Manhattan destroyer. He became morose and silent; and his only occupied by exhorting the speed of the position, as if he were going to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived in Calais; a breeze, which seemed obedient to his will, someone threw him on the English shores; he hastened to the master's house of his magnifiers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his sister's arid caresses, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile claws, she had gained her effect, now that the woman began to approach, she was even more batting as a companion.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that victorious groceries who won the look and applause of the clumber in the salon. There was none of this light brilliance that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a fleshy melancholy about it that seemed to arise from a mesfortune, but from some feeling within, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, which wanders where a butterfly or a color must attract – it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her face was not illuminated by the smile of joy; but that her brother crushed her affection, and would forget in her presence, those deed that she knew destroyed his roots, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptuary? It seemed that these eyes, this face, then played in the light of their own native sphere. She was still on eighteen, and not had been introduced to the world. It was thought by his more able guardian lhal hor presentation should be delayed until the return of his brother from orientate him, when he could be his protector. It was a riow, therefore, solved the next living room, which approached quickly, blurred the cpoch from the entrance of the bar into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the house of his fathers, and fed melancholy a bim which was overpowered. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, that his mind had been so torn by the ants he had seen; but he detamines to cooperate with his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon stopped in the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been announced as a salon.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawing room had not held 6 for a long time, and all those who were anxious to bass in the smile of the kingship, they hadten. Aubrey was there with her sister. When he stood in a corner by himself, listened to all the people around him, engulfed in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was there — which felt himself bribed by the clum, and that a voice was too well recognized, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn around, fearing of seeing a spectre that would explode him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place at the first entrance of bis into society. He looked until his almost members refused to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself into his car, and was driven home. He passed the room with horrible steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before hiin – circumstancos began in a terrible picture – the dagger – his death .— He woke up, he could not believe it was possible – the decredive ascent again !— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible for him to be straightened — so he decided to go back to society; for, although he tried to conjure the Lord Rutbven, the name of a table hung on his lips, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later, to his sister's mind, to the assembly of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a reef, and gave him his own eating breads. When he finally saw several people leaving, he woke up and entered the other room, found his sieve surrounded by several, he appeared in a serious conversation; he tried to pass and approach her, when one, whom he begged to move, tumed around, and revealed to him these traits that he was most abhorrent. He took his sister's organ, and, with a hurry, forced her to the street; and at the door he found himself hindered by the crowd of seruants who were a waiter for their lords; and while he was passing them, he heard again the voice of the thal whisperer at home —\"Remove your oath !\" — He dared not dyed, but, sends his sister, so he came to the house.\nAubrey almost distracted herself. If before he had the evil mind was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now that the eertainty of the life of innouncing him again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now without regard, and it was in vain that she would irritate her to explain to her what had caused his conduct abruptly. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he ate, the more disconcerted he was. His oath surprised him ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, carrying a ruin on his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid progress? Maybe his sister was overthrown by him. Bill, even if he violated his oath, and revealed his suspect, who would believe him? He thought of using his own hand to free the world from misery; but death, he recalls, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw the iron one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with peeking eyes, was assisting him, for his own good, to support ours. Finally, he is no longer able to support and loneliness, he leaves his home, wanders from the street on the avenues to steal this image that haunted him. The dress of this became negative, and it waridered, as often exposed to the midday sun as at midnight humidity. He was not a loriger to recognize; he turned to the house at first in the evening; but at last he laid him down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. His sisler, anxious for his safety, used to follow him; but they were soon removed by the hive that fled from a swifter chaser than any — from thought. His behavior, however, suddenly, got bad. Struck by the idea that he left with his absence all his friends, with friends among them, whose precence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and the watch narrowly, anxious avant-garde, despite his oath, all who in LordRuthven approached with intimacy. But when he entered the room, his hamburgers and his look suspects were so striking, his inner shivers so visible, that his sister was finally forced to ask him to darken up the scene.\nKing, for her, a society that infected her so strongly. However, when the repetition proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his mind would be alienated, they had the great time to take back the rust that had been imposed upon them before by Aubreys parents.\nIn an effort to save him from the wounds and suffering, he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they consider to be madness, they asked a doctor to reside in the house, and to take care of him with toughness. He seemed to notice, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was confident in his room. He often lied there for days, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, the eyes bis had atllinated a glazed chandelier ;— if only a sign of confection and recolectremaining showed himself at the entrance of his sister; then even as the times would begin, and, by licking his hands, with the thal ercemently distressed glances, he desired that she would not praise him. \"Oh, don touch him, if your spoil is for me, don't come near him !\" However, when she asked whom it was necessary to refer, her only answer was :\"True! Trip !\" And again, she sank in a state, from which she couldn't shave it. This lasted for many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his incoherences became less frequent, gripped his mind threw a porlion of his morosity, while his guards observed that several times in the day he would count on his fingers a certain number, and then smiled.\nThe time had almost disappeared, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entered his room, began to convorise with his doctor on the melancholic circumstances of Aubrey being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked him from anxiety. Happy with this mark of return intellectually, because they feared that he had been deprived, they reneged on the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country who had been met in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and astonished them even more by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptials, arid desirous of seeing his sister. They responded to the riot, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently able to be struck by the inflection of his beautiful smile; for he pressed her into his chest, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing at the thought of the being of his brother orrice swears alive to the eyes of affection. He began to splatter with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage, a person so distinguished for his rank and all his achievements; when he suddenly saw a medallion on his chest; opening it, which was surprised to hift to jostling the features of the monster who had so long invaded his life. He grabs the portra in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under the fool. On her asking him why he tbused the resemblance of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her — and hen siziring her tapes, looking at her with a frantic excrescence of face, he told her to swear that she would never marry that monster, for he — but he could not advance — it seemed that this voice made him remember his oath — he suddenly turned around, Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guardians and the doctor, who had heard the whole book, and who thought it was a return of his disorder, entered, and Miss Aubreys forcing, tried to leave him. How fell on his knees to them, he begged, he begged them to delay, but for one day. They, attributing this to the folly that they imagined, had taken possession of his mind, were striving to plcify the bim, and retreated.\nLord Ruthven had called Mom's clerk in the living room, and had been reused with all the others. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he readily understood that he was the cause; but when he had learned that he was considered mad, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be corroborated by the information he had slipped. He hastened to the house of his former companion, and, by his dismaying attendance, and he pretenoes a great affection for the house closed and interest in his destiny, he gradually wanted Miss Avbreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language had dangers and labors to resign—could speak of himself as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on a crowded ear, sowing with his talk which he addressed himself ;—could say how, since her knowher, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of preservation, could he simply listen to his soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well to use the art of the serpent, or that was the destiny of the will, that he gave him effects. The title of the elder branch that fell to him at the entrance, he obtained an importing embassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state ), which was to take place the day before his deportation to the continent.\nAubrey, when left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He wrote a letter to her sister, the conveying, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grave, who command her in their arms as their hope and hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest mo curses. These servants promised that they would deliver it; but give it to the doctor, he thought it would be better not to harass any more Miss Aubreys mind by, what he considered, greasing a mclinoc. The night passed without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that can be more easily conceived than described, the notes of the occupied preparatian. Camo in the morning, and the sound of the cars broke on his ear. Everybody grew up almost frantic. The curiosity of the serrants finally exceeded their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of an old womani helpless. He seizes the opportunity, with a bond was out of the room, and in a moment is in the apartment where all was almost assembled. And the LORD Ruthven was the first to pierce him; and he came to himself immediately, and took his arm by force, and cast him out of the room, without a voice, with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if not my brilliance until this day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the elder wife, had become a lover in search of him. Aubrey could no longer provide for him; his fury had no running vent, had burned a vase of blood, and he was carried to bed. This riot was mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid of agitating her. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom were afraid that Loridon.\nAbbrey weakness increases; bloodshed produces symptoms of the near-death approach. He wanted his sister's guardians to be called, and when midnight had struck, he told what the reader had perpetuated, and immediately died.\nThe guards havetened to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they arrived, it was too late. John Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTERNAL OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of them, where to choose his place of rest, and pronounce his guide .\"\nBy sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of Her Majesty's ships, in 1812, we placed in the prefect of Mltylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the supply of certairi of bovine arid vegetables still in bo had there, leading many British vessels to visit it — both warmen and merchants; and although it is rather out of the way for ships linked to Smy-\nPremiums are largely reimbursed for the income tax.\nIt is a trip. We landed; as usual, at the cauldron of the bay, arid that the men were employed in watering, and master trading for cattle with the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself looked at a ramble at the cave cailed Homer's School, and other places where we had been before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a Greek young as our guide, who told us to come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before our arrival is his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said Groek ,\" and he would have put me in danger; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I might be married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house of honey, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in the charge of him: he gave Dominick, wine-trader, fix a hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English evidence ,) and resided there about fourteen moriths, but not constantly; for he said in his felucca very desleri to the various islands .\"\nThis curiosity attracted us a lot, and we did not waste time hastening into the house where our compatriot had resided. We were kindly received by an old man, who bore us over a private hotel. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply decorated: pollclin green-stained wails, unstoppable tables on be faithful, a great mystery in the center, and a small\nntain below, which could be made to play through the hranchos by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a bent picture; a large touch or sofa completed the furniture. In the hall there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, nor a single painting. The bcdchamber simply had a mattress of a large lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a salad – the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a rees of marble. Once, the old man told us, filled with books and paper, which then carried in a great best of sailor in the class: it was open, but we did not think ourselves justissied by examining the contents. On the tablet of the recess are Vallaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseauf complete works; the Ruinsof Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopftock; the novels of Kotzebve; the play of the Robbcrs of Sohiller; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian publisher, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constarinotinople, torn mueh, but no English book of description. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally grib bled also over, and marked with flips of paper, on which too were remarks.\nThe old husband said ,\" The Lord had read these books in the evening before he sailed, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until his return; for which is so special that I have moved a thing with orders of doubt, he would sling upon me for a hesitation together. Being is otherwise very good. I did him a favor once, and I had the farm produced for the trouble of taking care of him, except twenty zechins that I have only to an elderly Armenian who resides in the small house in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know for the reason of the whale .\"\nThe appearance of the outer dung was pleasant. The portico at the front was sifty places long and fourteen wide, and the flutcd marble pillars with plenty of black and carnices of cargo work ,( cls it is now usual in the Greek arena ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stoning balustrade, was covered with a beautiful turkey carpet, under an awning of coarse fort Iinen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks pass their evenings smoking, drinking great wines, such as \"lachryma Christian\", eating fruit, and taking advantage of the breeze evenerig.\nFor fear that they would enter the house, a small creek glissa, grapes, orariges and lindens clustring together on the edges, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a seat marblc with a back of ornarntal wood was placed, or we were told, the lord passamany of his enigres and nights until dawn, reading, writing, and at 1 king to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, because he was very fervent, and that he always attended our church twice a week, besides Sunday .\"\nThe view of the seat of this was what can be called \"a fly bird view\". A line of rich verneyards 1st eye of blue on Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and myrtlo trees in blaom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple seemed majestic rotten. A small creek from the ruins defceri ded in the coscades of brokeri, until it is lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The sca is smooth like glass, and a hor....\nizon, not overshadowed by a single cloud, ends the view in front; and a little to the left, near a view of high chest and palrn-trees, several small islands were distinctly abservod, spreading the light blue wave with emerald green spolf. I rarely enjoyed a larger view than I did; but our demands were unsuccessful as to the Persian that the name that had resided in his romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said over the conductor ,\"could say ,\"I sure he won't do it,\" and can you say, old money?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We did not have the time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the bass, we learned several particulars of the seigneur isolated. He had shared eight young girls when he was lost on the island, and even danced with them at the wedding party. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. So he bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all we have understood, to have been a very eccentric and caring character. A circumstance that we have learned, which our old friend at the cottage should not reveal. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord was often seen walking on the sea-part, and he had bought him a piano-forle, and had taught him the use of just.\nThis was the information with which we left the peaceful island of Mitylone; our imaginations everything on the rock, guessing that its rambling Iri Greece could be. Hc had money, it was greedy: he had a philanthropy of dispositlon, and also those eccentricities which marks the peouliary genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled.\nThat is him. Falling in the company of Mr FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he said, on whom you are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him in my travels on the island of Tenedos, and I visited him in Mitylene .\" We had heard of the fame of this lordship, as we had been a few years from home; but \"Childe Harolde\" being pulled into our hands to recognize the process of Calcla on each page. We deeply regretted not having been more curious in our gazes at the culture of TB, but we will console our thoughts with the idea of resuming at Mitylene some sulphurous day; but behold, that day will never return. I rinse this statement, believing that it is not entirely uninteresting, and in court in the right name of its secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, averso Toassociant with hurnon nature, or contributing in any way to such his pains, or adding to his pleasure. The fact is directly the opposite, the class can be clearly collected from these small anecdotes. All the finest feeling....\nThe songs of the heart, so elegantly inlaid in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bosom. Tondity, fympathy and thority seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of loneliness is an additional repulsive to mark him as a being on the heart where Religion Halh has put his seal, and on whose head Berievolence has cast his coat. No man can read the preceding folding \"trats\" without feeling proud of him as a peasant. As far as his love or his pleasures are concerned, I do not suppose the right to give an opinion. The reports are always to be received with a calion, especially when dreeted against the moral lawlessness of the rnan; etho who dares to justify himself before this awful court where all must approach, cllone can cede the mistakes of a confrer-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. For the good in secret, the arid departs from the application of the world, is the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-approving conscience.\nTHE END!\nGillot, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "44": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very general in the East. Am orig the Arabians it seems to be common: it does not, however, extend to the Greeks until after the establishment of the Christianity; and it has taken its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea of becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupulate if it was buried in the territory, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful storio, still existing, of the deod rising from their groves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, he spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, where the belief existed, that the vampyres were imbibing at the night part of the certain blood of their victims, who became emaciatodes, lost their strength, and died spoedilly of consumption; while these suckers of human blood grew — and their cues became distended to such a state of repulsion, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skins.\nIn the London Journal, around March 1732, is a curious and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrism, what is said to have taken place in Madreyga, in Hungary. It seems, on the examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, that, positively and unanimously asfirinated, that about five years earlier, an oertain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been hard to say, that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had begged by a varpyr, but had found a way to rid him of the curse, eating part of the earth from the tomb of the vampyr, and to rub himself with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent him from scorning a vampy himself; for about twenty or thirty days after his death and burial, many people complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four persoris had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to prevent the inhabitants from consecrating their Hadagni, took the body of Tbe, and found it (as is supposed to be done in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely secreted corruption, and emitting the Mauth, no ., and ears, pure and slorid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A track was driven entirely through Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he would have cried so terribly or as if he had been alive. e :6! And they cut off his head, and endured his body, and cast ashes into his grave. The same measures were odified with those courses who had previously died of vampyrism, for fear that they would in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal helief is that a perfonsucked by a vampyr becomes a whole vampyr, and sucks in its turn.\nChief of usher.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is related here, because it seems center adapted to illustrate the subject of these observations. than any instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment astering death, for a heinous crime committed while it exists, tell the death.\nsed is not condemned to vampyria, but is obliged to confide in his international visits only to the beings he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by the bonds of arid affétion .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vainpyrus hath sent him, thy oorse shall be torn from his sepulchre; and the place of the ncltuus, and shall suck the blood of all thy seed; thy daughter, sister, and wife, threshing at midnight shall drain the ruin of life; and yet hate the banquet that shall feed thy livid living corsus, thy victims, even they shall perish, and shall know the devil to heir sire: as ye cursed Ihem, Tby flowers are full of spirit upon the stem. But a fight for your crime must fall. The youngest, the most loved of all, will wrap you with the dream of a father. This word will engulf your heart in flames! Yet you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the last glassy look must see who ejaculates his lifeless blue; then, with the unhalifted hand, will tear the braids of his hair, of which, in life, a lock when the tenderest pledge of affection has been carried — but now is gone far from your memorial of your agony! And thy blood shall flow, thy gnashing tooth, and thy heave lip; and thou shalt hunt thy sulleri sepulchre, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until those who are in horror depart from the spectre more bound than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in his wild poem of \"Thaloba\", the varpyrous course of the Arab named Oneiza, which is represented by the bone having re-tubated gravo with the aim of tormenting it, she washed the best while it existed. But this cannot be supposed to be the result of the sobriety of beer life, it was spread through the whole taste as a complete type of purity and irinocence. The true Toumefort is a long rush in his journeys of several amazing cases of vampyrisin, to which he claims to have been eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, has published some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classic error, as well as barbaric.\nAlthough the present may suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily dedicated to the explenaison, and which can now be concluded by simple remark, that if the term Vampyre is the oon in most general acceptance, there are several other synonyms with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, at the beginning of the dissipations accompanying a London winter, it appeared to the various panios of the leaders, a ton a noble, more noticed for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, Tbe Fairs light laughter drew his attention only, so that he could also extinguish it, and fear in these breasts were thoughtless. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain what it was up to: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, while staring on the opposite face, did not seem to penetrate, and suddenly, topierce through the inner functioning of the heart; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities invited him to be invited to all the houses; all were impatient to see him, and the thase that had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were raining something in their prosenoo able to attract the attention of our attention. Despite the deadly hue of her face, which never gained a warmer hue, either of the blush of modesty, or of the slrang ernotiori of passion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to win attitudes bis, and galn, at least, some marks of what they were talking about affection: Lady Meroer, who had beentho inockery of each monsler worn in the drawing-roorns since her marriage, threw sounds in her way, and did everything but put on the dress of a montebank, to attract her attention :— although in uan :— when she stood before him, although her eyes apparently fixed on her, it seemed that they were not piggy ;— even her unapplied impudence was bclffled, and she left the field of Tbe. But even if the common adults could not influence even the direction of his eyes, it was not the female fex that was indifferent to him: yet it was the apparent cautiori with which that he spoke to the vi rious wife and innocent daughter, that few knew that he was ever addressing females. However, he had the reputation of a tungning tongue; and if it was there that he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they mocked his apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among those women who boasted of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who shook him by their vices.\nAt about the same time, he arrived in London, a gentleman moving from Aubrey's dream: he left an orphan with an only sister in possession of great wealth, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. He was also left to him by guardians, who are only taking care of his forlon, while they give up the most important charge of his mind to the guard of simple subalterns, he cultivates his imagination more only his instrument. So he has this high regal feeling of honor and candor, which every day requires so many milliners apprentices. He believed to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice was incrusted by Providence only for the picturesque effect of the fence, as we see in the mandes: he thought that the misery of a cottage was conjured up in the garment, which were also warm, but which were better adopted to the eye of the painter by their irregular folds and the stains of various colors. He thought, in spite, that the dreams of the people were the realities of life. He was beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when entering gay circles, many mothers surrounded the babes, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or blushing fovorites: at the same time, by their dazzling faces as he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he was working his lips, he soon led him as noticians of his talents and his merits. Attached as he was to the kingnance of his lonely hours, he was surprised to find that, except in tallows and wax candles that darted, not from the present of a ghost, but from a snugging jerk, there was no foundation in truth for the arrival of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Discovering, how, some compensation in the vanity gratis said, he was about to requisition his dreams, when the extraordinary beingwe above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe observed it, and the impossible to form an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, who gave few other signs to his observation of the Exlerian objects, that taclt consent to existence theory, implied by the avoidance of their contacl: allowing his imagination to imagine all that flattered his propensity to the extravagclent ideas, he soon formed this object in her0 of a romance, and determined to observe the osfspring of hls floy, rather than the person in front of him. He has become familiar with him, has paid him contributions, and so far has advanced in his opinion, that his presence was still recognized. He learned grudgingly that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, afraid, quickly found, from the notes of preparation in — Street, that he was preparing for a trial. Desirouf obtained some information respecting this singular choracter, which, until now, had only brandished his curjosity, he suggested to his guardians, that it was time for him to perform the turn, which so much generalis has been tugt neccssary to allow young to lactate a few rapid steps in the career of vice towards putting themselves on an equality with the elderly, and not allow to the in to appeor as if fallen from the sky, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned the subjects of acceptable or praise, according to the degree of competence that he had in the pursuit of these ones. They consent: and Aubrey immediately mentioning his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join him. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of bim, which apparently had riots in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few months they had passed the surrounding waters.\nUntil now, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study the character of Lord Reveri, and now he faurid, that, although many more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the results have offered different conclusions of the apparent motives to his conduct. His composition was profuse in promiscuousness, bis ;— idleness, vagabond, and heggar, received his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate desires. Bul Aubroy did not hesitate to point out that it was not on the virtuouf, reduced to indignation by misfortunes, that he even granted to virtue, that he granted to his alms ;— they were serious of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profigué came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow Bim to tarnish his lust, or to sink it deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This was, however, attributed by bim to the greater importurity of the vicious, which usually outweighs the rotating frenzy of the virtuous needy. Thero was one circumstance about the chassary of his Lordship, who was even more impressed on his mind: grip those on whom he was granted, inevitably found that there was a curse on him, because they were all led to the scafsold, or funk to the bassel and the most basic misery. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised by the apparent eagerness with which his companion sought centres of all the fascinoble vice; there he entered into the whole spirit to the fayo table: he hated, and always glittered with success, except where the known sbarper was his antagonist, arid then to be lost always more than he won; but it was always with the same immutable face, with which he generally wate the society around: it was nol, However, so when he encountered the Yovthful novice eruption, to fatber him without chance of a great family; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune-this apparent abstraction of the spirit was oside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat while deliring with the half-dead mouse. In each city, he left the old rich youth, torn from the circle of Tbe, he smelled, cursed, in the loneliness of a durigeon, the fate that had attracted help to the reach of this friend; while mary a father sat frantic, ainidst the talking appearance of intel hungry children, without one end of his last immense wealth, where with to buy even enough to satisfy their desire for presentity. Yet he did not take money from the table of play; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of my money, the last guilder he had just pulled out of the convulsive catch of the innocent: this bulb is the result of a degree of certain knowledge, which was not, rainbow, occlusable to fight against the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent this Lo Hif friend, and begged him to resign from this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and did not make his own profit ;— but he delayed it — for every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, he never happened. The Lord Ruthven in the carriage bis, and in the midst of the various wild and rich scenes of birth, was the same: his eye spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he obtained no more gravity than the constant excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which to his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some superriatural thinking.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he threw it every day in the presence of a Countess of Italy in the morning circle, while he went in search of the memorials of the anoteric, the most deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he impatiently worked; the first came from his sister, opening nothing but affection; the others were of his guardians, the latter stupefied him; if he had come from his imagination, there was an evil power residing in his companion, he seemed to give him sufficient reason for belief. His guard instilled in his friend, arid, that his carousel was terribly vicious, because the possession of irresistible powers of seduction made his licentious habits more dangerous to society. He had discovered that bis cantempter sor adultery had not stirred up in the hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to strengthen his gratistiori, that bis victim, the associate of his guilt, she veled from the pinriacle of the non-sulliode virtue, dowri at the lowest hyssée of infamy and degradation: in fe, that all the femoles which he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since his departure, thrown aside the mask from the side, and had not burned to expose all the distortion of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, the house character had not yet swollen a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext to abandon it completely, purposing, in the sense that, to look at it more closely, arid love does not let pass any slight non-noticed circumstance. He entered the same circle, and immediately perceived, his Lordship was eridvorous to work. on the inexperience of the lady's daughter of whom he frequented the chief house. In Italy, it is a feldom that the woman is uninarried meets in society; he was therefore obliged to pursue her plans in secret; but Auhreyf looks at the follow-up in its windings, and soon discovered shot a bad donkey was named, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent girl, though without thought. Losing the hour, he entered the world. Ruthvens apartment, clinging abruptly to ask him for his intention of responting your baby lady, informing him at the same time that he knew that he was about to inoculate him that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he believed that all the world had such an ocoasis; and after being rushed to marry him, he laughed joyfully. Aubrey withdrew; and, immediately, by writing a note, to say, he must refuse to accompany his Lordship in the romander of their extended visit, he rode a servant to look for other apartments, and call the mother of the lady, informed members of all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day merely sent his servant to notify his opposite consenting to a separation; a bull caused a riot any suspicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nHoving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greee, and crossed the peninsula, soon found himself in Athens. He then fixed his solidity in the house of me. Greek; arid soon took care to trace the faded records of ancient gary on the monumerits which, apparently, ashclined to chronicle the acts of the free only before slaves, had hidden themselves under self 1 sheltering or mary colored lichen. Under the sunken roof like himself, there existed being, so heavy and so criminal, that she could have formed the model of a softener wanting to operate on canvases the promised hope of faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit so that someone thought that she could belong to those who had no soul. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, one would have thought of the gazelle a bad type of its beauties; for who would have changed his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious leopic look of the adapted animal but to the taste of the ari bone spruce. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied by Aubrey in his search for antiquarians, and often would be the poisonous girl, engaged in the pursuit of a butterfly of Kashmere, showed all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the euger gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on ari almost eclipsed, in the contemplation of his figure of sylph. Often, the pressures failing, as she flirted around, expose in the ray of the sun so deliciously hrilling and quickly failing hucs, he might well excuse the obligations of the antiquarian, which lets escape from his mind the very object that he had before thought of vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to decipher the charms that everyone feels, but that no means appreciates ?— It was innocence, youth and beauty, without being hit by crowded drawing rooms and striking balls. As he drew these remains of which, he wanted to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood by, and searched for the magical effects of his pericll, tracing the scenes of his nalive place; she would describe him the circumling dariceupon the open peain, wauld painting, to him in all the brilliant colors of your motherry, the wedding pump that she remembered to look at in young age; and then, turning to sub-jeets who had obviously made a greater impression on her reindeer, would tell bim ail the suprematural tales of her nanny. Her curiosity and her apparent belief in what she tells exudes the very interest of Aubrey; arid often as she told her the story of the living vacuum, which had spent years among her friends, arid dea-\nthe bonds of rest, forced every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful female prolongs her exile in the following months, her blood ran cold, while he tried to laugh at him with so many idle arid fantasies; the hut Ianlhe quoted to awaken the names of the old men, who had elected to Iast a man living among themselves, after many of their close relatives and children had been marked with the tho stamp of the called friend; and that she had found him so unbelievable, sho begged of him to believe it, for he had been pointed out, thal those who dared to question existence, had always had evidence, who bliged them, with pain and hearing to tear, to confess that it was true. She gave him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and his horror is magnified, hearing a precise prelty disillusionment of Lord Ruthven; however, he still took to persuade her, that there could be no truth in his fears, although al the sarcastic lime that he wondered about the many coincidences that had all tended to excite a belief in Lord Ruthvens supernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling to himself more and even more to mention; his innocence, so recruited from all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought to see love, gained his heart; and while laughing at the idea of a young man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, he found that he...\nElf more and more attached to almost magical storm before him. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he decided not to return until the object he was reached; bvt he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around himself in his mind, he removed the ari image which seemed to be the only legitimate possessor of his thoughts. The patient was unconscious of love, but, and was still the same child he had known for the first time. She seemed reluctant to separate from him; but it was because she had tried more than one with whom she could visit the favorite haunts, while her guardian was busy drawing or infiltrating a fragment that was bad but evacuated the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of Vampyres, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with horror in the name itself. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to proceed on an af his excursions, which had to detairi hjm for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at the same time begged not to come back at night, as it must necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek would ever stay, the clock the day had closed, on any consideration. They described it called the station of vampyres iri their rioctoturnal orgios, and denounced the most ugly evils as imminent on hiin, who dored to cross their way. Auhrey made the light of the representations of lbeir, arid tried to laugh at them of the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his daring to mocking a superior, infernal power, the very name of whooh apparently freczed their blood, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left for Japan just without participation; he was surprised to get melancholy in front of his host, and was confounded to find that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible friends, had inspired them with the terror of each. When he was about to break off, Ianthe came to the side of the horse, and begged him to return, and he allowed the power of the wings of his to be put into an action ;— he promised. However, he was so busy with his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day of Tbat was about to end, and that on the horizon there was the origin of these spokes which, in warmer climates, so quickly gather in a huge mass, and pour all their rage on the devoted country .— He finally, however, mounted his horse, determined to compensate for the speed of his delay: but it was late. Twilight in this support-\nThe climate is almost unknown; immediately the sun goes down, the night begins; and the dawn has progressed, because the storm's power was above — its thunders were scarcely resting — its thick roaring forced its way around the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall and radiate at its feet. Suddenly, his horse got scared, and he was carrified with the terrible speed through the entangled forest. The animal finally, through satiguo, stopp ed, and it sounds, by the brilliance of lightning, that it was in the vicinity of a house which hardly rose from the masses of dead leaves and brushwood which surrounded it. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a guide of 1 to help the city, or at least trust to shelter himself from the storm. As he approached, the thunders, for a silent moment, allowed him to hear the truth.\nof a woman mingling with suffocating mockery, exulting with a laugh, continued in an almost intact sound ;— he was surprised: bvt, awakened by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a blow of force, forced the door of the heat. He found himself in the darkness: the sound, however, guided him. He was apparently not perceived; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no remark was made this. He found himself in a contaot some one, which he immediately grasped; when a voice cried out :\"Agaln turned down!\" to which a great laugb suoceed; and ho folt hirnself hacked by a whole force seemed superhuman: determined to sell his life as dearly as he could, he struggled; but it was in uan: he was lifted from his feet and thrown with enormous force against the ground :— his enemy threw him so on him, and knelt on his chest, had placed his hands bis on his throat — when the glory of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;—he instantly roused, and, leaving his prey, pressed the door, and in a mother the crushing of his branches, as he broke the word, was more heard. The storm was still now; and Aubrey, who was moving, was soon heard by those who had none. They entered, the lethargy of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the charge of tbatch on each straw with soft flakes. At Aubreys desire, they sought the beer who had drawn the bim with his cries; he was again in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torches burst again upon him, for the airy percelvetbe form of his beautiful conductor brought into a course of life. He was beating his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision coming from his troubled imagination; but he again saw the same shape, which he did not close, extended by the side of the hills. There was no colour on his cheek, no riots even on his lip; however, there was a mortilege on his face that seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, orid on his throat were the marker of the leeches that were on his vein :— to this men pointed, wept, struck at the same time with horror ,\" In Vampyre! Phantom !\" A litter was formed quickly, and Aubrey was placed next to her who had recently blessed him with the ob of so many brilliant and magical visions, now fallen with the flower of lily that had died with her. He did not know what his thoughts were, his mind was inflamed and had fun running away from reflection, and taking refuge in the vacancy, he held a naked dagger of a particular construction in his hand, which had sounded in the cabin. They were so numerous with different people.\nThe girl who had engaged in the mercy of her that the mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, approaching the city, told the parents a terrible catastrophe. \"That it would be impossible to describe the gift of their; but when he determined the cause of the death of their evil, they looked at an allergy, clinging to the Corsican. They were unconscious; both died in a broken heart.\nAudrey being put to bed had a violent foam fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he could appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe – by the same incomprehensible combination that he seemed to be begging his fragrant companion to wear the being he loved. At other times, he was estimating the maldictions on the head of his, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the chance to arrive in Athens, and, from any move, after hearing about the state of Aubr, they immediately placed in the same house, and became his constant assistant. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of the one whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyro; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, involving almost acceptance for the fault that had caused their separation, and still moro by the attention, anxiety, arid care that he showed, soon reconciled with the presence of this. His Lordship seemed quite changed; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so surprised Aurey; but as soon as his convacenoe ganized to be quick, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Auhrey perccida no difference with the former man, except that at once he was surprised to meet his gaze fixed with intent on him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this film haunted him. During the first stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Ruthven apparently engaged in the fight against the tideless waves raised by the coolinglor in rnarking the progress of these orbs,circling, like the our world, still svn ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubroys inirid, by this shock, was greatly weakened, and this elasticity of the mind that once a bad and distinguished bim now seemed to have fled forever. He was as fond of silence and silence as Lord Ruthven; but he wanted a lot of solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he once frequented, his shape stood by his side – if he was looking for him in the woods, his slight step seemed wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly, turrifying around, would show, with his wild imagination, his pale and thral-injured face, with a gentle smile on his lips. He has determined to steal the scenes, all of which have created such bitter associations in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthuen, to whom he was bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they scrambled those parts of Greee and had not yet seen. They travel in all directions, and submit each place to which a memory could be attached :6 But although they hadtened to go from the room to the room, he did not seem to take into account the whale they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to diminish these relationships, which they imagined as the invention of the different, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of those that they drew from the preluded dangers. As a result of this neglect among the advice of the inhabitants, ori ori occasion, they have worked with only a few guards, more to serve you as guides than to defend. On the training, Howevor, a narrow desile, to tbc boulom de which was the bed o o torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from laneigbbouring practices, they bad reason to repent lheir negligent; for almost all the parties engaged in the narrow pass, when they were scattered by the whist lang of olose bvllets at their head, attached by the ratio echo of several cannons. In an instant, their guards had left them, and, placing themselves behirid rocks, had begun to fire in the origin of the Camic report. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind the lurri sheltering from a dcfile tube: but shameful of being thus held by an enemy, who, with insulting cries, made them advance, and being exposed to slaughter without resistance, is only thieves should fall over and place them in the back, they decided both to rush forward in search of the enemy. They had scarcely lost shelter from the cock, when Lard Ruthven received a foam in his shoulder, which led him to the impound. Aubrey hastened to go to his assistantariae; the land, who no longer takes account of the ephemeral or peril, is quickly surprised when he sees the faces of the rabbis around the hjm — his guards who, after being wounded by Lord Ruthven, immediately threw their arms and surrendered.\nBy promising a great reward, Auhrey soon encouraged them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby cabin; and, having agreed to snoring, he was no longer disturbed by their presence — they simply trained the entrance until their comrade retum with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days death followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain he had been of those objects about him: but towards the end of the last evening, his mind apparently became uncomfortable, and his eye often looked upon Auhrey, who was led to offering his help with more than the usual seriousness —\" Help me! You can save me — you can do more than that — I do not mean my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can drunken my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need, but a little of my life, I cannot explain the whole thing, but if you hide everything you know from me, the honor was spotless in the mouth of the world, and was my death unknown for some time in England, me, but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear that for a year and a day you will not give any knowledge of my crimes or of my death to your living being in any way whatsoever, whatever happens, or whatever you may see .\" \"His eyes seemed six-fold from their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrcy; he was laughing at his pillow, and was no longer breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present at the knowledge of this man arose from his mind, and he did not know why; when he remembered his death, a cold chill came upon him, as it is of the presentation of something horrible waiting for a bim. Using early in the morning, he was about to enter the coffin in which he had left the body of Tbe, when a rohber met him, and irritated him that there was no three longer, having transmitted by himself and the comrades, at his retreat, at the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given his seigneury, that he could have been exposed to the radius of the call first of the moon that rose after his death. Aubrey deafened himself and took several of the meri, determined to bury him on the spot where he was. But, when he had climbed to the top, he did not find any trace of the clothes course or lhe, although the thieves swore that they indicated the identical rock on which they had laid the body. For a while, his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but which at the tip came back, convinced that they had buried the corpse to the socée of clothes.\nWeary of a country in the whip, he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, and in whom apparently conspired to increase that superstitious melancholic thal had taken up his mind upor, who resolved to Leaueit, and soon arrived in Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naples, it is busy organizing the effects that it had with it belonging to Lord Ruthven. Among other things, there has been a case containing felonyweaporis, more or less one baptized to ensure the death of the victim. There were several daggers and Afghanistan. While returning and examining their curious for ms, what was bis surprise to find a sheath apparently orriamented in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to get more evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can he imagine when he discovered that he was equipping, in particular shape, lhesheath that he held in his harid. His eyes did not seem to need more certainty, they seemed to look at a lo bouride at the dagger; but they still wanted not to believe; but the particulate form, the varying shades of the samo on the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splendov on both, and leaves no doubt sor; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyma, and on the way home, in Rome, the first investigations were about the lady he had tried to remove Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in a difference, their fortune ruined, and she had not been a hero since the departure of her secretary. The Aubrey spirit was almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady might have fallen victim to the destroyer of Ianlhe. He became more and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, as if one was going to save the reading of someone considered expensive. He came to Calclis; a breeze, which seemed abdient to his will, soon to be cast brown to the English sbores; and he hastened to the house of his fathers, arid there, for a soothing, seemed to lose, in the embraces and caresses of his sister, all the memory of the past. If she had before, their infantile ears gained her effect, now that the woman began to operate, she was even more endearing as a company.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the arid applause of the salon donkey. There was no light of it. but brilljanoy that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was lit by the piousness of the mind below. There was a melancholy on this subject which did not seem to be born of misfortune, but of a certain feeling inside, which seemed to indicate a conscious soul or a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not that the light foot jng, which wandering where to wear a butterfly or color can attract — it was sedative and pensive. When Alono, his face was bewildered by the breath of joy; but when his brother breathed his affection for him, and in his presence, those deed tried to destroy his rest, who would have exchanged it with that of the volcano? It seemed that these eyes—that dance was then playing in the light of their own native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world, having believed by her guardians more fit than her taking should be delayed until the return of her brother from the continent, when he would be his protector. So it was now decided that the next salon, Whib, should approach quickly, should be the epoh of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey was going to fight in his father's house. Arid was tired of the melancholy that surpassed him. Ho could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable strangers, when his mind was so torn by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his elder to the protection of his sister. They soon came to the city, and prepared for it the next day, which was announced as a parlor.\nThe crowd was excessive — a not parlor had been held for a long time, and all those who were eager to bask on today's smile, hastened to do so. Aubrey was there with his sister. As he stood at a corner by him myself, without taking into account all that was around him, he plunged into the memory of the first time he had seen Lord Ruthin in that place, he suddenly felt seized by the elm, and a voice that he recognized too well, sounded in his ear –\"Remember your club .\" He had little to turn, afraid of seeing a specter that would blow him up, that he had pierced, at a distance from a little, the same figure which had drawn his attention to this place when he first entered society. He looked until his members refused the most to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and passing through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He played the room with horrible steps, and fixed his bands on the high head, as if he feared that his thoughts would explode from his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began in a picture of horror — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up himself, he could not believe that it was possible — death rose again! e :— He thought his imagination had conjured the image on which his mind was turning. It was impossible that it could be real — so he delrminated, to go back into society; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the riarne hung on the lips bis, and he could not succeed in obtaining information. He went a few nights later with his sister to the assembly of a relative. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he withdrew into a corner, and there gave himself his own devoring thoughts. Finally, when he saw that he was raining a lot of water, he woke up and entered another room, found his sister surrounded by many, tame in a well-deserved conversation; he was tempted to pass and approach her, when one of them, whom he asked to move, turned around, and revealed these high features to him the most household. And he went forth, and took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a furious march, forced her to the street; and at the door he was hindered by the eruption of the servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was passing by, he heard this voice murmuring with him again :«Remember your oath !\" He dared not turn, but, pressing his sister, soon returned home.\nAubrey is almost distracted. If before his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely he was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life once again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now checked, said it was in vain that she asked her to explain to her what had caused her brutal conduct. He spoke only a few words, and thus terrified her. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath surprised him ;—did her then allow this monster to roam, carrying ruin upon his breath, in the midst of all that he held dear, and not to avoid his progress? His fisher could even have been touched by them. But never, if he broke his coats, and revealed his suspicions, what would he believe? He used his own hand to exterminate the world from such a misery; but death, he recalled, had already been mocked. For days, he remained in this state; locked in his room, he saw no one, and he only went when his sister came, who, with tears in his eyes, begged the hive, for his own good, to beg nature. Finally, he is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandering from the street to the street, anxious to steal the image that haunted him. Her dress has become neglected, and be wandered, as often exposed to the midday sun as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; at first he returned in the evening; but at last he laid him down to rest wherever fatigue prevented him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow them; but they soon became distracted by him who fled from a faster pursuer than anything — of his own. His conduct, however,\nI changed. Struck with the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a madman among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to enter again into society, and to watch him closely, anxious to predict, despite his death, all that Lord Ruthven learned with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his baggard and his suspicious eyes were so dizzying, his inner pitfalls were visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for abstinence again to seek, for his false, a society that so strongly affected him. Wheri, however, resurrence turned out to be unwarranted, the guardians thought appropriate to interpose, and, fearing that his mind would become alienated, they thought that he would be raised to regain the trust that had previously been imposed on them by Aubreys parents.\nDesiring to save him from the insult and asphyxiation that he had experienced in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing these marks of what they could do insanity to the general eye, they hired a doctor to reside in the house, and took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, so that competently, his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His intelligence finally became so great, that he was confined to his chamber. He often lies for little ones, unable to be woken up. He had become emaciated, his eyes had attached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of apseclion and memory that remained appeared at the entrance of his sister; then he began sometimes, and, grabbing his hands, with gravely distressed thoristic eyes, he wanted her not touch. \"Oh, don touch him, if your love has come to me, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he reserved, her only answer was :\"True! True !\" and again he has sarik in a state, from which she could not even wake him up. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, his became iricoherences less frequent, and his mind threw a porlion of his morosity, while his guardians observed that several times in the day, he counted on his fingers, a number definitely, then smiled.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room, began to converse with his physicicicical circumstances of Aubreys being in such a heinous situation, when his fisher was going next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, for fear that it was fallen, they mentioned the dwarf of the Earl of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young country he had in company with me in society, Aubrey seemed happy, and stunned them still with me by expressing his intention to be present at the nuptjals, and eager to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his beautiful smile; for he pressed his chest hard to, and kissed his cheek, wet with tears, flowing to the thought of his brother enlivening himself once again to the feelings of offending. He began to speak with all his heat gained, and tocongratulate it on his marriage with a person so distinguished for rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly pierced a local upan his chest; opening, wbal was his fury to look at the characteristics of the monster who had if long influenced his life. He captured the portrait in a polysm of the group, and trampled it under the imbecile. On her asking him why he destroyed the resemblance of the future husband, he loakedas if he did not understand the beer, then took hold of his hands, and looked at her with a frantic expression of the face, he told the swcar that she would never marry this monstor, because he — but he could not move forward — it seemed that this voice resumed his oath — he suddenly turnedly, thinking that Lord Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guardians and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and who thought it was only a return of her disorder, entered and pushed him from Miss Aubrey, desired that she abandon him. He fell on his knees towards them, implored, and begged them to delay the cabin for a day. They attached this to the inseparity that they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had called the morning after the drawing room, and had been refuted with every house. When he heard of Aubreys infirmity, he realized that his sons were the cause of it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and his plea could be gagged from those among whom he had obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his power? His language presents dangers that one can tell: one could speak of himself as an ordinary individual who has no sympathy for being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed himself; one could say how, since he knew her, her existence, seemed worthy of conservation, if it was not simply that he could listen to her soothing. In the end, he knew so well how to use the art of this snake, or such was the will of destiny, that he ruined his affection.\nThe Ns. The title of the older branch falling to it in length, he obtained an important embasfy, which was striving like an ox to hasten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which was to take place like the day before his departure for the thc cannot.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and his guards, tried to bridge the serrants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those now in the grave, who once held her in their arms as their hope and hope of their house, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he gave the heaviest curvature. The servants promised that they would delude him; but giving to the doctor, it is better that he no longer harassed the spirit of Miss Aubrey by, what he considered, this ravings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the busy immediately of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a horror that one could more easily conceive that described, the notes of occupied preparation. Morning came, and the Surah of the cars broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants finally overcame their vigilance, they gradually turned away, leaving him in the custody of a woman is a childlessold. He took advantage of the opportunity, with a dog outside of the TBC room, and in a moment I found himself in the apartment where all was normally sombed. The Lord Ruthven was the greatest man who prepared him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by the farce, he rushed out of the ridge, furiously moving away. When Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear on the shelf :\"Remember your goal, and know, is not my bride in the daytime, your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" And he said, he hath put him in search of his servants. What has the old woman awoke? Aubrey could no longer pleaseport him himself; his rage riots found the vent, had broken a blood-vessel, and he was transported to bed. This was not mentioned to the sister's bis, who was not present when he prayed, as the doctor was afraid to agitate him. The wedding was celebrated, and the bride and husband left London.\nAubreys weak nodes are increasing; bloodshed produces symptoms of the approach close to death. He wanted his sister's guardians to be calm, and when midnight had struck, he told us what the reader had perpetuated: he died afterwards.\nThe guards rushed to protect Misf Aubrey; but if they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubre....\nThe sister of you had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, whore to choose his place of real, and Providence his guide .\"\nIn 1812, we placed in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The height of this place, and the poisoning of some frozen vegetables still to be found, lead many British ships to visit it — both meri de guerre and mermeri; and although it is rather off the track for ships linked to Smyrria, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and while the men were employed in watering, and the cattle bag merchant with the laughs, the clergyman and I took a ramble in the cave called Homer's School, and other places where we had before being. On the grow of Mount Ida (a small mountain so named) we met and hired a young Greek like our guidance, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the island four days before we arrived in his felucca. \"He hired Mc as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would take me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylene, where I was likely to get married. He was a weird man, but he was very good. The house on the hill, facing the river Tbe, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dorninick, the winegrower, six hundred zechins for her ,( about Lz 50 Curreney English ,) and rucked on the four three months, but not constantly; for being sailing in his felucca very often to the islands different .\"\nThis account excited over curiosity for a lot, and we did not lose time. Iri has been listening to where our compatriot had resided. We were greeted by an old man who led us over the mansion. It consisted of four apartments on the ground floor, an entrance, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious fitted wardrobe. They were all simply docure: green wall plairi, marble tables on the other side, a large myrtlo in the center, and a small fountain below, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the side of a small Bronze Venus in a lean posturojng; a large couch or sofa completed the furniture. In the room stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: lrc were not mirrors, nor a single point. The bedroom has a mercly a large spread mattress on the floor, with two cotton stuffed quilts arid a pillow — the common bed throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed a recos of marble, peasant, the old man told us bloody with books and papers, which were thin in the trunk of a great sailor in the closet: it was open, but we do not think nosees justified in exomining the content. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Billeau and Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmermori, in the German language; the Messla of Klopstack; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schillers Roberts; the Paradise of Milton Lost, an Italian edition, prayed to Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the album. The Greek press in Constantinople, very strong, but no English book of any degradation. Most of these books were filled with margnal noodles, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with papal leaves, on which the colors were remarks.\nThe old man of Tho said :\"Tobe lord had 6th reading these books before being sailed, and forgot to place them with the others; bull, he said, they must there 1st until his return; for it is so special that I had to move a living without order, which would frown me for a week together; hc is otherwise very good. I have done him a service, and I have the product of this farm for the pain she has taken, except twenty zechins which I pay to an elderly Armenian who resides in a cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe exterior appearance of the house was pleasant. The frantic p ortico was fifty steps long and fourteeri wide, on the canned marble pillars with plinths black and freight-work cornices ,( as it is now oustomary in Greciari architecture ,) were considerably higher than the raof. The roof, surrounded by a light stamen balustrade, was surrounded by a carpet of sinus turkey, under a rough slrong flax awning. Most of the aro top houses thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks pass their fumigs by smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma christi\", selling fruits, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nIn the left hand, as we entered the house, a stream of small glissa, pomegranates, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, hanging in the shade of large bushes of myrlle, a marble seat with an ornamental wooden bar, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until 12 o'clock, reading, writing and speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he prayed, for he was very fervent, arid, always attended our whole church for a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird view\". A moon of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calola, covered with olive trees and myrles in bloom, arid from the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decay. A small stream emitting from the ruins descend in cascades of broken, until it is lost in the wood near the base of the mountain. The smooth sea as the glass, and the horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, tarnished life in front; and a little to the left, through a glass of hazelnuts and lofly palm trees, small islets were observed distinctly, spreading the light wavy blue with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in his romantic solitude: no one knew his name but Dominick, his bariker, who had gone to Canada. \"Tho Armani,\" said our leader ,\"could say it, but I sure he won\" and can you say it, old friend ?\" I said ,\"if I can\" said hc ,\"I don't dare\". We don't have much time to visit the Armenian, but on our return to the city, we learned the seclusion details of the secluded lord. He had worn eight young girls when he spent the last night on the island, and even danced with him at the wedding feast. He gave a cow to a man, borsos to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving articles of cheese. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own in a storm, and was often gauged G reek Teslaments to poor children. In short, it seems to us, of all that we have called, to have been a very eccentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we called, which our old friend at the contract considered appropriate not to disclose. He has a very beautiful daughter, whom the Lord often saw walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him himself the use of just.\nThis was the information that we left the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations or the rack, guessing who this creep in Greece could be. He had money, it was inevitable: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those ecc ertricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who was traveling to Egypt on Greeco ,\"The individual,\" he said ,\"about whom yav are so worried, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never had the fame of his secretary at that time, and had been the same years of the house; but \"Child Harold\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcia on every page. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curious in our research on the side, but we have become corisolated to the idea of returning to Mitylene on any day; but to me that day will never return. I make this statement, by improving it not entirely uninteresting, and in justice, the good name of losing Lordship, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive provision, contrary to association with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease its punishments, or to add its pleas. The fact is terribly the opposite, as it can clearly gather from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so gloriously represented in the pooms of his secretary, see to have their seat in his bosom. The tenderness, sympathy and tenacity seem to guide all his actions; and his courteousness to the rest of solitude is an additional reason that marks him as a being whose heart region sealed, and on whose head, Benevolence cast her coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"laughters\" without feeling proud of him. As far as his rents or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume the right to give an opinion. The reports must be received with caution, with brilliance when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; arid he who declares himself justifies in front of this terrible court where all the must appear, only can censor the errors of the other-mortal. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest testimony of virulent beauty and self-approved consequences.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "45": "A VAMPYRE:\nA Challenge.\nBy John William Polidori.\nThe superstition on which this tale is based is very geriatric in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be emmorial: it did not extend the Greeks until after the establishment of the Cbristianity; and it did not assail its present form since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; to which timo, the idea of becoming pregnant, that a Lat in the body could not corrupt so buried in the territory of the Ihère, it gradually increased, and formed the subject of many wonderful stories, extinct still, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful. In the West, he spread, with some variation of view, to Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorraine, that there existed the belief, thethal vampyre soaked a cortain part of the blood of the victims, who emancipated, lost their strength, and died quickly from consumption; while these human blood suckers were greasing — and their veins became disposed of such a slate of the repletion, in order to cause the blood of all the cages of all the bodies to fall, and everyone from the same porefos their skins.\nIn the London Journal, of March ,732, is a curious, and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrisin, which is the status of having occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. He appears, thal upan an examination of the commander-in-chief and the masters of the place, they affirmed positively arid unanimously, that, about five years before, a certain Hey-\nDuke, named Arnold Paul, child was heard at soy, that in Cassova, at the borders of the Tv right Servia, he had been tormented by a vampyr, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating from the orne on earth, the grave of the vampyr, and rubbing himself with his blood. This precautation, however, does not prevent harm from scorning a marriage himself; for about twenty or thirty days astride his death and burial, many people complained of having been tormented by him, and a statement was made, that four people were deprived of life by his attacks. To prevent the furtbermousse, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (sis pleased to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and completely free of corruption, and emulating with mauth, nose, and ears, pure blood and florid. As the evidence was thus erased, they resorted to an ausualized remedy. Attack was pushed erirely through the heart and Arnold Paul's body, where he would have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and tore the ashes of his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of these two people had previously drained vampyrism, lest they in turn become agents on others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is, it is a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and sucks in its turn.\nChief Baiiff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is hercized, as it seems preferable to illustrate the subject of the observations present than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of puriishment after death, for a hereditary crime committed while in existence, that the deceased is not only condemned to vampyria, but forced to limit his Iranian visits only to those beings he loved most on earth — those to whom he was flouted by kinship and offense .— A supposition alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first on the earpiece, as Vampyre sent him, the horn shall be torn from the tomb of them; and then the place of origin, and suck the blood of all thy race; from thence of the daughter Ly, sister, wife, midnight drain the flow of life; yet forget the banquet which must feed by Livid Livjng Corsica, Your vltims, are still exhaled. They will know the devil for their sirc; As the cursed tbce, thou cursed them, Thy flowers will wilt on the stem. But the one who for your crime must fall, the youngest, the best loved of all, Shall bless thee with the name of a false — This word Shail envelops your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the lasl thing of his cheek — the spark of his eye, and the glazed laft look must see who freezes his lifeless blue; then with his bare hand will tear the glasses of his yellow hair, of which, in life, a scarf padlock. The most diligent help of affection is carried by the Momorial of your agony! But with your own best blood will drape; your nibble lobes and your harging lip; then, tracking your tomb sullcn, Go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these horrors iri depart from the spectre more secure than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced in bis wild but beautiful poems of \"Thalaba\", the vampyr corse of the good Arabic Republic, which is presented as hauer relurned detbe falls in order to torment the fact better loved while being in existence. But this cannot be assumed to have been the result of the sinfulness of his life, being spilled throughout history as a complete type of purity and innocentness. Tovrnefort gives a long account in his travels of several amazing cases of vampyism, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great support work this subject, besides the cl variety of anecdotes, and traditional accounts illustrating its effects, presented some learned dissertations, tending to show that he is a classical, as well as barbarial error.\nAlthough the term Vampyre may suffice for the limits of the note, neo-testically devoted to explanition, and which can now be concluded by simply curling up, although the term Vampyre is that in general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, the insane use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardoulacha, Goul, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London winter, several parties of the leaders of the town appeared a nobleman, more remarkable for his singularities, than his rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he couldn't participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the fair drew his attention only, which he drenched by a look, crush him, and threw a feud into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who seal this sensitivity of fear, cannot explain from where it rises: some attribute it to the dead grey eye, which, staring on the face of the object, do not seem to penetrate, arid to a single glance to pierce through the interior works inside the heart; but fall upwards the cheek with a ray of lead that wind on the skin that he could not pass. His peculiarities have caused him. He invited every house; all wanted to see him, and those who had been used to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of boredom, were happy to amass something in their capable presence to engage their attention. Despite the deadly dizziness of her face, which never gained a warmer tint, eilber of the blush of modesty, or the strong emotion of the passlon, although her forrn and contour were beautiful, many female hunters after notoriety tried to win her attenlions, and gained, at least, what care marks that they might call affétion: Lady Mercer, who had been the mockery of euery monster shewn iri drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in a bis manner, and did anything but put on the dress of a movntobank, to take into account her opinion :— although in uan :— when she stood before him, although her eyes were apparently fixed on her unapplied impudence was 6 affluished, on her left field. Although common adultery could not affect even the greed of his eyes, there was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet sucb was the apparent action with which he spoke to the virtuous and innocent woman, some knew that he was speaking to women. However, he has the reputation of a winning language; and although he has overcome it even from the fear of his singular character, or that they have been moved by his apparent hatred of the vice, he was also often among those women who form the vanity of their sex of their domestic virtues, as among those who push him by their vices.\nAbout the same time, there came in London, a young geritleman named Aubrey: he was an orphan left with only one sister in possession of a great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in childhood. Left also to himself by the guards, who thought it was their duty simply to take care of his fortune, while they gave up the greater burden of his mind to the custody of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated into his imagination than his judgment. He had, John, this high romantic feeling of honor and candor, which daily runs so many apprentices of a thousand. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, and to say that vice was flouted by Providence only for the pictogram effect of the scene, as we see from the inromances: either that the misery of a cottage was simply iri the uesting of the clothes, which were as hot, but that we adapted better to the eyo of the painter by their irregular folds and various colored patches. He said, in the end, that poets' dreams were the realities of life. He was handsome, frank, and ricb: for these reasons, on his inheritance in gay circles, many mothers surrounded him, trying to describe the least truth, their favourites languishling or grumpy: the girls clinged to the same lime, by their briddlening countenancics when he approached, on the eyes sporkling, when one opened his lips, soon brought a bim in a false note of his talents and his meril. Attached if he was to the romance of his solitary hours, he was surprised to find that, with the exception of the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, rioting of the presence of a ghost, but of the snuffing canaille, there was no furnace in the life of real for none of these congreries of pleasant photos and descriptions contained in these volumes, brake that he had formed his studies. Finding, however, some compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up the dreams, but when it is extraordinary that we above described, went through it in his career.\nHe observed it; arid the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of observation hift of external objects, that tacit attachment to their existence, imitated by the avoidance of their contact: allowing his imagination to imagine a thing evoked that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object as a hero of romance cl, and decided to observe the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person before him. He has become familiar with him, has paid attention to him, and so far has gone ahead with his opinion, which his presence was always recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Stevens affairs were seized, quickly found, from the node of preparation in — Slr-\nAnd that he was about to get to the Iravol. Desiring to give a little information about the singularity of this, which, now, had only to stifle his curiosity, he suggested to his guardians that it was time for him to make a visit of them, which for many generations was considered necessary to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the care of the vice to put various equality with the elderly, and not to allow them to ap peclr as if fallen from the sky, whenever scaridalous intrigues are mentioned as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill they bring to listen to them. And Aubrey unequivocally evoking his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join the ham. Flattened by such a mark of esteem of Hiin, who apparently had nothing in common with other men, he readily accepted it, and in a few days they had passed the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Aubrey had not had the opportunity to study Lord Ruthven's character, and now he has found that, a thousand more of his actions have been exposed to his point of view, the result has offered different conclusions of the apparent reasons for his conduct. His company was abundant in his liberality ;— the vagrant, the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid making remarks, that he was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the malfortvnes atteridating even a virtue, that he granted his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door with barely repressed fingers; but when the profligence came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, or to sink him even more into his iniquity, he was sent away with rich charity. This, however, was attributed to the greatest impossibility of vicariousness, which generally outweighs the retirement of virtuous indigents. There were important circumstances concerning the charity of his Lordship, which was even more impressed on his mind: every tip on which he was raised, inevitably sounded that there was a curse on her, because they were all either at the foam, or sunk to the law and the most absent military. In Brussels and in the cities where they were passing, Aubrey was surprised by the ardour with which his companion sought the centres of all fusbionnable vices; he entered there in all the spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and always won successfully, except where the best known was his antagorist, and then he lost even more than he had won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with the hand that he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, so when he encountered the eruption young novice, or father without chance of a large family; then his very desire seized the law of Fortvne — this apparent abstraction of mind was laid aside, and his eyes shimmered with more fircil than that of eating while deliring with the mouse half dead. In every city, he left the old tributary....\nThe youth, torn from the circus which he has adorned, cursed, in the selfitude of a dungeon, the fate which had drawn him to the reach of this friend; while money of father sot fritic, in the midst of being speaking of the gazes of a mute hungry child, without anything far from his later immense wealth, where to buy even sufficient to satisfy their present desire. Yot he took no silver srom table of play; hut immediately lost, lo the ruiner of many, the last guilder he just pulled out of the convulsive grip of the innocent: this might hit the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, possible to fight the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often wished to present him to his friend, and begged him to sign this charity an arid pleasure which caused the ruin of all, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but he delayed — every day he hoped that his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and openly to him; however, this never happened. Lord Ruthven in the carriage, and in the midst of various wild scenes and rich in nostrils, was always the same: bisoeil spoke less than his ljp; and although Avbrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not get any more gratification from him that the constant excitement of wanting vainly to remove this mystery, which to his cast imagination began to assume the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon clinged to Rome, attaching Aubrey to a lost time of his companion; he left the bim in daily joy in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in fear of the memories of another almost deserted city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which was striving impatiently; the sister came from his sister, breathing only from the afaction; the others were from his guardians, the latter stifled him; if he had entered into his imagination that there was a bad power in his companion.\nef. His guards insisted that he immediately left his brief friend, and urged that his character to be terribly vicious, because this passing of irresistible power of seduction made his fiery habits more dangerous for society. He had discovered that his coritempt for adultery had rioted in the hatred of his character; but that he had acquired, in order to strengthen his gratification, that bls victory, the associate of his guilt, had to be thrown from the pinnacle of unwelcome virtue, to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all the females that had been sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, from his sorbre, even thrown the mask aside, and had not scrupulously exposed all the distortion of the irreversibility to the public gaze.\nAubrey decimated by leaving one, what character had not yet shown a single luminous point on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a pretext of pleasure in order to abandon him completely, in order, in the sense, to monitor him more closely, and not to let any dark circumstance pass by unnoticed. He entered the same circle, arid soon received that his secretary was working on the inexperience of the lady's daughter whose house he quickly requested. In Italy, it is rare for an unmarried woman to meet in society; which was therefore forced to pursue her plans in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him throughout his similif, and soon discovered that an sensation hod was named, which would end up likely in the ruin of an innocent girl, though unimaginable. Losing did not have time, he entered Lord Ruthvens apartment, and abruptly asked him for his hints with respect to the child, informing him in the hour to sarne that he was aware of his obstinacy to meet his at the same night. Lord Ruthven answered....\nof such an opportunity, and after having been in a hurry to find out whether he intended to marry him, he was content to laugh. Aubrey retired; arid, immediately writing a note, to say, that from this mountain he had to docline accommodate his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit of Tbeir. He ordered his servant to seek further talk, and called the mother of the lady, informing him of all that he knew, not only as regards his daughter, but also about the character of his Lordship. The sensation was prevented. Lord Ruthven the next day simply sent his servant to notify you of complete consent to a separation; bvt not suggested any suspicion of his plans having been smeared by the interpositori of Avbrey.\nAfter leaving Rome, everybody headed for Greece and crossed the Peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. Ho then fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and soon took care of traoing the documentsfaded of ancient glory on monuments which apparently, shameful or chronic the acts of free men only before slaves, child hidden themselves under the sheltering ground or many colorful clothes. Under the same role of himself, exified being, so beautiful and delicate, that she had formed the model of a painter wanting to pour on canvases the promised hope of the faithful into the paradise of Mohammed, except that his eyes spoke too much mirid so that someone might think that he might be among those who have no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the inuntain, the gazelle would have been thought of a poor type of hor casties; for whom would have exochanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated riature, so that the luxurious dormant look of the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ianthe often accompanied Aubrey in his search for the antjquities, and often he would be a girl unconscjous, engaged in the pursuit of a Kasbmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of its shape, floating as it was on the wind, to the eager look of hlm, who forgot the letters that he just deciphered on an almost erased tablet, in contemplation of his sylph style figure. Often, her braids fell, while she was wilting, exhibited in the ray of the sun, delicately brilliantly and quicklyly discoloring the hues, he mishil will excuse the oblivion of the anliquary, which let escape the mind of this very object that it had been considered vital importance for the proper interpretation of a passage in the Pavsanias. But why try typing charms that everyone feels, but laugh can learn ?— It was innocent, young, cold beauty, without being affected by crowded drawers --\nglooms and suffocating balls. As he drew these remains of which that he wanted to keep the amorial for his future hours, she stood, and looked at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of his place of origin; she would describe him the clrcling dclnco on the plain of the apen, painted, to him in others the brilliant lovers of youthful memory, the mclrrage pomp sbe remembered having seen in his infarction; and then, of course, turning to the that subjects had made a greater impression on his mind, told him all the supermatural tales of the Hor nurse. His fervour and his apparent belief in what she was telling, exclaimed the very interest of Aubrey; often as a sbe told him the story of the living vampy, which he had spent years in the midst of his family, and the dear bonds, appeared every year, feeding on the life of a beautiful female to prolong bis existing once for the sniffs that followed, his blood rolled, that he had had the warmest to laugh at such an idea and horrible fantasios; but Ionthe quoted him the nomos of the old men, whom he had finally detected one living among themselves, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked by the stamp of the appetite of friends; and when she found him so unbelievable, she begged to believe it, for it had noticed that those who had dared to exterminate their existence, had always had evidence. oh, with cries and strokes of heart, with true cries. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these walruses, and her horror was increased, hearing a rather precise description of Lord Ruthuen; however, he still persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in her feet, although at the same time he wondered about several coincidences that had all feared exciating a belief in supernatural power of Lord Ruthven.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to mention; his innocence, so congratulated by all the virtues affected by the woman among wham, he had sought his romantic voice, won his beort; and while he was rudiating the idea of a young of English habits, marrying a Greek girl without instruction, he sounded more and more attached to one of the furiousest before stopping. He was sometimes tearing himself from her, and, forming a plan for some anti-avarian research, would have gone away, determined not to return until his object had been reached; but he found it impossible to fix his attrition upwards the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that seemed to be the sole owner of his thoughts rights. Nathan was unconscious of his love, and has always been the frank childish sarne that he had first known. She always separated herself from him with the reluctanee; but it was because she no longer had anyone with whom she could visit her favorite clothes, whatls her guardian was busy sketching or discovering a fragment that had still wiped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of companies, and both, with the present coveral, affirmed their existence, pale with the horror of the name of every. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey determined to proceed to the price of his calories, which was to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, they all at the same time begged him not to return at night, as he must pass through a wood, where no Greek would remain, after the day had closed, until any consideration. They dethroned it as the station of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as imminent on the one who dared to cross their way. Auhrey made the light of their representations, and dragged them to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them trembling at this thus daring to make a superior, infernal power, the very name of which he apparently made to freeze the blood tobeir, he was fluent.\nHe was surprised to observe the melancholy face of his host, and was concerned that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired this terror. When he was about to leave, Ianthe came beside his horse, and begged him to come back, and the night passed allowed to put the power of these beings into action ;— he proinized. However, he was so busy with his research that he did not perceive that the daylight was going to stop, and there was on the horizon one of those which flies, in warmer climates, so quickly gathering in a huge mass, and pouring all their rage over the devoted country .—He finally, However, riding horse bis, deterred catching by speed for his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in these animals of the south, is unknown; immediately the sun goes down, at night bogins; and it had advariated far, the power of the storm was engaged — its thunders failed had barely an interval of rest — its heavy rain forced them to go through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fall encumbered radiates to its own feet. Suddenly, his horse was scared, and he was buried with a terrible rock through the tangled forest. The animal finally stopped, the fatigue stopped, and found, by the light of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof which hardly rose from the masses of dead breads arid wood that surrounded him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find a little more than a guide to the city, or at least relying on the storm shells. As he approached, the thunders, relieved by a moment, allowed Hiin to hear the terrible cries of a mercenary who mingled with the exultant mokeria of a stifled Iaugh, convoked in a single sound of almost unbrokeri ;— he marveled; but, agitated by thunder, the again rolled over his head, and, with a sudden effort, he forced the door of the hut. It found itself in total darkness: the sound, however, melted it. He was apparently not perceptive; for, although he called, the sounds continued, and no advice was taken from him. He made contact with someone, who immediately seized; when a voice cried out :\" Again haffled !\" And he felt him, if he came up against him, whose strength was kindled with the help of supperhurnan: he began to make himself a life as expensive as he had done, but he fought against him; but it was in vain: he was lifted up from his feeling, irritated, hurled with enormous force against the ground: his enernia threw himself a bim, and fell on his knees on the breasts of bis, had laid his hands on his throat; when the dazzling, snare, torches penetrating into the hole that lit the day, had disturbed him; he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, arid the branches in an instant, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was now still; and Aubrey, unable to innovate, was soon heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the thatched loaded on each individual straw with heavy soft flakes. A tho deslre delivery they searohod for his wbo had caught him by his screams; he was still 1 ft iri darkness; bvt what was his horror, when the light of thc torches once again bursl Upan, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductor brought in a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that It was a vision derived from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the sarned form, when he closed them, stretched their side. There was no colour on the beer oheek, no oven on his lip; yet, the there was a face of aboulher that seemed almost as attached as the life that the patient lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this man pointed, crying, at the same time struck with horror ,\" A vampire! e :\"A vampire !\" A litter quickly formed, the arid Aubrey was the hyroid on the side of the ber who had already been for him, the treatment of so many brilliant and fairy visions, a riow fallen with the flower of life that had died with it. He did not know what his thoughts were: the big spirit was inflamed and seemed to run away from reflection, and to take refuge in the vacancy; he held unconsciously almost in his hand, a naked dagger of a partial consluction, which had been found in the cabin. The various parties who had been enlisted in the search for her whom a mother had missed soon met them. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, irritated by him...\nA draconian disaster. \" To describe their mourning would be impossible; but when they determined the cause of their child from alh, they looked at a Aubrey, arid pointed to the worse. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed had a very violent fever, and was often delirious; in these intervals he appealed to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by a valuable combination, he seemed to be begging for his former appearance to spare the being he loved. To others, he permeated the curses on his head, and cursed him as a beer destroyer. Lord Ruthven, was lucky at that time to arrive in Alhens, and, for whatever reason, after hearing about the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same house, arid became his constant companion. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and began at the size of the bim of which he had the riow image combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lord Rutbven, by his kind words, involving almost repentanco for the dirt that had caused their separation, and even more by attention, anxiety, and care that which showed, saon reconciled him to his presence. Hjs seigneury seemed quite flouted; it did not appear that the apathetic being who had so astonjshed Aubrey; bvt as soon as his convalefcericc began to be fast, he gradually removed into the same state of mind, and Aubrey realized no difference with the former inan, except that altirnes who was surprised to meet his staring gaze, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, bvt this smile haunted him. During the last stage of the invalid recovery, Lord Ruthven was apparently engaged in the heating of the tideless waves raised by the collision breeze, or to mark the progress of these orbs, circling, like our world, motionless to the sun ;— independent, he seemed to be rocking himself to steal the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, weakens a lot, and this elastia of the spirit that had once so distinguished him does not seem to have fled forever. He was today as lonely and silent a lover as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired, his spirit could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he had previously frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side – if he sought him in the woods, his slight step might seem wandering in the middle of the undergrowth, in search of the modest violet; then suddenly he turned around, he could show, to his wild imagination, his pale face and his wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He determined to steal the scenes, each of the characteristics that created such associations of children in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, that he had been bound by the tender care he had taken from him during his illness, that they visited the parts of Greece and that they had not seen. They traveled to all regions, and sought every place to which a memory could be attached; but although they rushed from one place to another, they did not seem to be what they looked at. They hurried many robbers, but they gradually flouted these reports, which they imagined only as the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those they defended against pretentious dangers. Because of this neglect of the local councils, they have sometimes dragged with only a few guards, more to serve as guides than as defence. When entering, however, a riarrow desile, at the bottom of which was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of bone rock descended from the neighboring precipices, he had reasons to repent of their neglect; sour scarccly were the whole party engaged in the narrow collar, that they were surprised by the whistling of balls olose at their head, and by it echoed the report of several weapons. In the instant, their guards had left them arid, placing themselves bechirid rockf, had begun to draw the direction from where the report came. Lord Ruthven and Aubrey, imitating their example, withdrew for a moment behind him, sheltering the turning of the defilement; but, like hammocks to be thus detained, an enemy, who with shouts their advarice, was exasperated to uriresting slaughter, if one of the thieves had to climb up and take them back, they decided both to torsob forward in search of theeriemy. Barely bad, they lost shelter to the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot on his shoulder, which brought him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to attend the bis; and, no longer taking into account the contest or his own peril, is quickly surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having been wounded, uphill, by Lord Ruthven, immediately thrown into his arms and handed over.\nBy promises of a great reward, Aubreysoon encouraged them to pass on wounded friend hjs to a cabin reighbovring; orid having accepted a snoring, he was no longer disturbed by their prefence — they were content to keep the credence until the Iheir comrade returned with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength quickly depreciated; in two days death followed, and death spread through hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had changed; he was also unconscious of the pain that he had been objecting about him: but towards the end of the evening, his mind was apparently uncomfortable, and his eye was often fixed on Aubrey, who was led to offering his acquaintance with the usual tuna pond members —\" Help me! You can love me — you can do more than that — I do not mean my life. I have listened to the death of my existence as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" I replied to Aubrey. \"I need a little bit of things — my life flourishes — I can explain the whole — but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world — and if my death stole a lot of lime in England — I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying inan, raising him up with exultant violence :\"Swear by all your soul, by all your nature fear, swear, for cl yecl and one day yau will not communicate to you the knowledge of my crimes or death, in any way whatsoever it happens, or of any you whatsoever. \" His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Aubrey; he ran with a laugh of hisspice, and had no more character.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not sleep; the many circumstances that were present to his knowledge of this man arose upon his fury, and he did not know why; when he remembered his oath, a cold chill came over him, as if fred the pre-feeling of horrible something waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, being about to enter the coffin in which which had left the corpse, when a robber met him, and informed him that it was not longer there, having transported by himself and comrades, at his retreat, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise they had given to his secretary, he should be exposed to the first cold king of the Indoon who was rising after his teeth. Aubrey was surprised, and fired several of the meri, decided to go and bury him on the place where he was. But the one he had mounted found no trace of the corpse or clothes, although the thieves swore that they had revealed the idenlic rock on which they had put the body. For some time, his mind committed suicide in the conjectives, but he came back for the last time, convinced that they had cooked the rice for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which he had inel with such terrible misfortunes, and just whom all apparently conspired to increase that superstitious melaricholy last had taken in his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport him to Otranto, or Naples, he took care to organize the those effects he had with him belonging to Lord Ruthven. There was, among other things, a case of contamination of the serolic weapons of supply.\nMore or less suitable to ensure the death of the victim. There were several cabbages and bananas. While turning them back, and exomining their forms of curlov, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently decorated in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — eager to obtain other evidence, he found the weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discussed.\nHe said that he had defiled, although in the form of a pencil, the sheath that he held in his hand. His eyes began not to need further certainty — they seemed to look at 6 th bound to the dagger; but he would not believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on the haft and the reatb were similar in splondour on the h-bot, and left no room for doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on his unhappy home in Rome, and his first inquiries were about the lady he had tried to seize Lord Ruthvens seductive arts. Her parents were in distress, their fortune turned, and it had not been heard since the deportation of the secretary's body. Aubrey's spirit became the most broken alarm under so many repeated horrors; he feared that the lady had been the victim of the ancient destroyer. He became a morosearid son; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the postilions, class if he were to save the injured bone, someone he held dear. He came to Calaif; a breeze, who began to obey his will, soon called him to take the English shores; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, iri, his sister embraces and caresses, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more touching as a company.\nMiss Aubrey didn't just win which win the eyes. and applause of the sitting room. There was no such light shine that exists only in the heated atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye never lights up by the levity of the mind below. There was a slender charm on this subject which not seems to come from the misfortune, but from some feeling withiri, which appears to undify a soul conscious of a rcalm running. His step was not thal light foot, which strays where a butterfly or a colour can attract — he was sedated and pensive. Alone, the smile of joy never illuminated him; but when his brother breathed his affection, arid in his presence would forget those sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have exchanged his smile for that of the voluptary? It seemed that these eyes—that face then played in the light of their own universe. She was still only a neighborhood, and had not been introduced to the world, he had been thought by the guards more in the shape of his presentation which could have been delayed by the return of his brother from the continent, when he reached his protector. So it was now resolved that the next show, which was approaching quickly, would be the time of its wandering to the \"occupied scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to stay in the manor of his falhers, and fed on the melarichole that dominated the bim. He could not feel interested in the frivolities of fashionable foreigners, when his mind had been so hot by the events he had intrigued; but he decided to accommodate himself with his own comfort to love protection of the store. They soon came into the town, and prepared for the next day, which was stifled like a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a drawer room had not held a long time, and also what was anxious to rest in the smile of the royality, rushed to it. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was standing in a corner from behind, without taking into account everything around bjm, engaged in the rembrarice that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthvenwos in that same place — he felt sudderileized by the arm, and a recognized voice too well, founded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He had little courage to turn, fearing of seeing a spectre that would explode him, when he saw, a little distance away, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place on this first entry into society. He looked until his limb refused the most to wear their weight, he was forced to take the arm of a friend, and to force a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He hastened to stop, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him —circumstances scattered away from a terrible hindrance — the dagger — his oats h .— He awakened, he could not believe that it was possible — the dead rose again !— He thought his imagination had averted the image upon which his mind lay. It was impossible that it could be real — which decided, accordingly, to go again in society; for although he had tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung his lips, and he could not manage to bring the information. He went a few moments later with his sister assembling a close relationship. After leaving the Hor under the protection of a matron, he retired to a recreation, and there he gave himself his devoring thoughts. Preceiving, finally, that a lot of wero leaving, he woke up, and surter another piece, found a hif sister surrounded by several, appeared in the conversation of winnings; he tried to pass and get closer to her, whori one, whom he asked in movo, turned rourid, and revealed to him these traits he hates. And he went forth, and took his sister's arm, and set in motion, and spooked, and intercepted him toward the street; and at the door he found sons hindered by the multitude of servants who were waiting for their lords; and when he undertook to pass through them, he heard again this voice whispering beside him ,«Remember your oath !\" He dared not dyed, but, in a hurry to his sister, he soon came to his home.\nAubrey bones almost out of control. So, if his mind had been absorbed by a subject, how much more completely just was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life again pressed on his teeth. The receptions of her sister were no longer listened to, and she invited her to explain to her what had caused her abrupt conduct. He only sew the words, and they terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His oath began hell ;— Was it to allow this monster to wander, to carry a long ruin over his breath, in the midst of all that he has defiled dearly, and not to avoid his progress? His sister might be touched by him. But never, if he broke his oath, and revealed his supplications, who would believe him? He tenaciously empoyed his own hand to free the world struck by a fubb wretched; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For he remained in this state; locked in his room, saw no one, and ate only when his sister came, who, with his eyes strangled with tears, begged for her your support of nature. Al fact, who is no longer able to carry calm and loneliness, he has a house of 1ft life, wandering from street to street, anxious to steal this image that flouted him. His dress has become neglected, and he wanders, as often exposed to the sun of the night as to midnight humidity. He was no longer to be recognized; but first to be returned with the evening at home; but finally, he laid him down to rest the tiredness of the whaler overtakes him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people to follow the bill; but they were soon detached by him who fled from a pursuer faster than any —f-\nThat is what I thought. His conduct, however, suddenly suffocated. Strack with the idea that he left by his absence all his friends, with a friend among them, of which they were preservious conscient, he decided to enter the into society again, and to look at him closely, anxious in advance, even despite the hif oats, all that Lord Ruthveri approached with intimacy. But when he entered a room, his discontented and rogue eyes were so striking, shivers of interior bars so visible, that his sister was finally obliged to beg him to refrain from seeking, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, beyond that, the demonstration turned out to be uriguating, the guards thought it appropriate to intervene, and, fearing that his mind was alienating, they thought it was a high time to regain that trust that had been previously irritated by Aubreys partners.\nDesiring to save him from the irisjurics and the sick whom he had met daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the eye these marks of what they considered madness, they hired a doctor to esido in the house, and constantly took care of him. He hardly seemed to notice it, if he was completely his mind absorbed by a real subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was conspired in the upper chamber. He is often lying there for the days, despicable to be awake. He had been emaciated, his cyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory remaining displayed himself at the entrance of his sister; the being would be a few to begin, and, taking hold of his hands, with looks who seriously afflicted him, he wished that she would not rent a bim. \"Oh, touch the riots, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When she comments, she inquired to whom he referred, if only the answer was :\"True! True !\" And again, he sank into the state, from where she couldn't even wake him up. It lasted a lot of months: groovy, however, as the year passed, his inconsistencies were less frequent to me, and his mind stirred up part of his morosity, while his obsessed guards, than several times in the day he ran on his fingers a definitive number, and then smiled.\nThe time has almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guardians entering his room, began to erupt with his doctor on the circumstantiated melancholy of Avbreys being in a terrible situation, when his sister will get married the next day. Instantly, Aubrey's attentist was attracted; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy is this mark of the return of the intellect, whose they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count whom he had met in society, Aubrey fell asleep, and astonished them even more by bis expressing his intention to be present at the nuptills, and desire to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the inslunce of a handsome smile; for he pressed her to hif breast, and kissed her cheek, wet of tears, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to the fields of the infectious. He began to speak with all his warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage to a person so distinguished for his rank and every accomplishment; that he should suddenly be seen a medallion on his chest; that he should be opened, that he was surprised to flout the traits of the monster who had so long influenced his life. He grabs the portrait in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under his feet. On her asking him why he destroyed thus the relationship of his future husband, he looked as if he had rioted understand her — then grabbing her hands, and looking at her with a frantic expression of face, he swears to her that she would never have been able to marry this monster, because he—but he could not move forward — it seemed that this made voice reminded him of his oath—he suddenly turned around, thinking that Lord Rulhven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who were heorizing everything, and though it was only a return from his disorder, entered, and Miss Aubreys sorcerer, wanted her to leave him. He fell on his knots to them, implored, he begged for a day's delay to but. They attribute this to the madness they imagined having seized his mind, pacified him and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven held the morning after the living room, and had refused to want another. When he heard Aubreys ill health, he readily understood that he was the cause; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could be hard hidden from this from which he obtained this information. He hastened the house of his former campaign, and, through the constant presence, and the presence of great affection for the brother and interest in his destiny, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who could resist his pagan? His tongue had dangers to tell and could speak of him as an individual who had no sympathy with any being on the overcrowded earth, except with the one to whom he added himself ;— could say how, as he has kriew, his existence, could begin to seem worthy of conservation, if it were not that he might listen to hor soothing accents ;— in the end, he knew so well how to use the serpents entanglement, or such was the will of the fal, that he gained his affections. The title of the elder branch fled to Iength tohim, he obtained an important ernbassy, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the disturbed state of his brother ,) which waf took place the day before his departure for the moment.\nAubrey, when was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in the vain. He asked for a pen and paper; it was given to him; either wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated happiness, the honor of her own, and the honor of those now in the grave, which once welded her in their arms as their back and the hope of their house, to delay but ill for a few hours this marriage, on which he loosened the heaviest curscs. The servants prornized they would deliver it; but give it to the doctor, he thought it was better not to harass Mifs Aubrey they any more, what he considered, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed on without rest to the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a terminal that could be more casiliary 6 th conceivd than described, the notes of occupied preparation. Hello, and the sound of the wagons broke his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants with regard to the vigilance of the government, they lost their graduate ally, leaving him in the custody of an old woman powerless. He pretended the occasion, with bound once, was out of this room, and in a moment was found in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, clinging his arm by force, rushed him out of the room, ruthless with fury. When a staircase, Lord Ruthven murmured in his row :\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancée today, that yourfisler is dishonored. The weapons are fragile !\" Thus, pushing him to his servants, a woman who had come in smoke from the old woman. Aubrey could not longer supart himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was transported to bed. It was not MENTianized to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor feared shaking him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the bride left London.\nAbbreys weakness has increased; the infusion of praduced bloody symptoms of the near-death approach. He may have desired his sister guardiari, and when midnight had rung, he told what the reader had hit, and he died immediately afterwards.\nThe guards flouted Miss Aubreys protection; but when they arrived, it was too late. Lord Ruthvon had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was all beautiful to him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guld .\"\nIn Sailing through the Greek archipelago, aboard one of the Maiesly ships, in the year 1812, we put in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of this place, and the certain supply of cattle and vegetables still to have, bring the British ships rnany to the visit—both of the arid merchants of war; and although it is rather out of the sor schlps track linked to Smyrna, its premiums pay a great deal for the deviation of a voyago. We disembark; usually bone, at the bay bottom, and while men we employ water, and be shaker trading for cattle with the native TB, the ecclesiastical and myself took a rain on the cave called Homer's School, and other places where the world was before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mountain named it) we met a cold engulfed of young Greck as our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lord, who left the sour island the days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me on board a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would have taken me with him; but I did not choose to negotiate, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but very good. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man in charge: he gave Dominick, the winc-trader, six zechincs grouped for her ,( about L 250 British currency ,) and he resided there about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he failed in his felucca very often to the different islands .\"\nThis account greatly exalted our curiosity, and we did not waste time, hastening from the house where our compatriot had seized. We were in kindly received by an old man, who corried us over the mansion. He confiscated four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance ball, a living room, a sitting room and a bedroom, with a spacious closet. They were also simply decorated: light green walls, marble tables on either side, a large myrtle iri center, and a small fountain beneoth, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a spring fixed on the tho side of a small bronze Venus in a lean posture; a sofa lorge or soft complete the furniture. In the half, I stood a half dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there was no mirror, nor a single point. The bedroom had a large mattress lying on the floor of Tbe, with two stuffed cotton duvets and a pillow – the cot in all of Greece. In the Siltirig room, we observed a marble reef, somorally, as we were told by the old mon, filled with books and papers, which are found in a large seaman's chesl in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the contents of the table. The works of Voltaire, Shakespeare, Boileau and Rousseau are finished on the re-creation tablet; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimmerman, in the German language; Klopstook's Messla; Kotzebues novels; Schillers play of the Robbers; Milton Lost Paradise, an Italian edilion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinople, torn muoh, but no English book of any description. Most of these books were wired with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and marked with flips of paper, on which they were also remarks.\nThe old man did :\"The Lord had read these books before he left, and he forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie until his return; for it is so special that if I were to move something without order, he would frown me for a week together; it is in other ways very good. I made him a sorcerer; and I have the product of this farm for the trouble of maintenance, except twenty zechins which I pay to an old Armenlan who resides in a small cottage in the woods, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe appearance of the house was extraordinarily pleasant. The portico at the front was fifty steps long and broad forest, and the marblc pilars canned with black plinths and first work cornices (as it is now a cuslornary in the Greek architect ,) were considerably higher than the roof. The road, overwrapped by a light stone balvstrade, was covered by a fine turkey carpet, under a strong coarse linen awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus smoked, as on them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking light wines, such as \"lachryma Christl\", eating fruit, arid enlivening the evening breeze.\nOn the left, we inherited the house, a small creek gliding, grapes, oranges and lindens were gathered on its edges, arid under the shade of two large bushes of myrtle, a grated seat with an emotional wood back was folded, on which we were told, the lord possessed many of his enigs and around until twelve o'clock, gnawing, writing, and speaking at bimsolf. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man ,\" that he was very polite, and that he always attached himself to our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this site was what can be called \"a bird view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcia, coveted with olive trees and myrles in bloom, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic day. A small stream from the ruins descended into broken waterfalls, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The glass sca smootb, and the ari horizon not eclipsed the hyo fingle cloud, lermincltes the view will be; and a little on the left, through a view of high hazelnuts and trace palm trees, several small islands were distinctly observed, spreading the light blue wave with spots of emerald willing. I rarely enjoyed a view more than I did; but our ququiries were unsuccessful as to the name of the person who had resided in this romantic solitude: no one knew his name by Dominick, his banker, who had gone to California. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\" could say it, but I sure he won ,\" and can you say it, old money ?\" he said ,\" If I can ,\" he said ,\" I dare not .\" We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned several details of the seclusion lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even danced with him at the Nuptillian feast. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and bacon to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a sisterman who had lost his own in a college, and he gave Greek tests to poor children. In short, we have appeared, frowned upon all that we have gathered, for having been a very eccentric and beneficial character. A circumstance that we learned, that our old friend at the cottage bought a clean not to disolose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the lord was often seen walking on the shore of the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and taught him to miss the use of this one.\nThis was the information with which was leaving the peaceful island Mitylene bones; our imagination everything on the rack, guessing who this crawling in Greece could be. He had the enmity, it was obvious: he had the philanthropy of the arrangement, and all those eccentricities that mark a particular geriatric. When we arrived at Palermo, all our doubts were dispelled. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had traveled to Egypt and Greee ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are so anxious, is Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedof, and I also visited him in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of bis Lordship, as we had been a few years of the house; \"Child Harolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the relief of Calcla on the page of evory. Did we not regret not having been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we ourselves had the idea to return to Mitylene ori on a future day; bvt to me that day never returned. I make this statement, I relieve it of all interest, and in court in the good name of its secretary, which has been grossly slandered. It has been described as an insensitive disposition, to associate with human nature, or to contribute in any way to appease his eyebrows, or to add to his pleasures. The fact is directly the opposite, because the hub is clearly picked up in these small aneodotes. All the finer sons of the heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seem to have their seat in his bathroom. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his actions; and bis courting the rest of society is an additional reason to mark them as a being whose heart, the Hatb religion has put its seal, and on whose head Benevolence hatb has cast his coat. Noman can read the previous pleasant \"traits\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not assume that opinion should be given. Reports must be received with caution, in particular the dock directed against the moral integrity of a man; said the one who justifies himself before this terrible court where all must appear, only can censor the errors of a funeral. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest tesalonia of a virtuous heart and a scelerate conscience of approval.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown Court, Fleet Street.",
    "46": "A VAMPYRE:\nA tale.\nBy John Willjam Polidori.\nTHE superstition on which this tale is based just very general in the Black East. Among the Arabs it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks until the completion of Christianity; and it assumed its present forms only the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the idea 6 becoming dominant, that a Latin body could not corrupt if it was buried in their territory, jl gravillly increased, clrid formed the subject of many wonderful stories, still ecstatic, of the dead rising from their graves, and feeding on the blood of the young and beautiful fvl. In the West, it spread, with the same slight variation, all the rest of Hungary, Poland, Austrio and Lorraine, where the belies existed, thal vampyres nigbly soaked up some of the blood of the victims, which became emaciated, losing their force, and died quickly of consumption; while these suckers of human blood grastened and their veins became distended to such a state structure, to cause the blood of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the London Journal of March 1732, it is curious and, of course, a credible account of a particular case of vampyism, which is said to have taken place in March, Hungary. It seems that, in an examination of the indinagistrat commandant-in-chies of the square, they positively and unanimously asserted that about five years earlier, a certain Heyduke, named Arnald Paul, had been bearded to say that, in Cassova, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of evil, eating part of the earth from the grave of the vampy, and ruhbing himself with his blood. However, this prediction did not prevent him from becoming a bimself vampyr; for about twenty or thirty days after his arid burial men complained of being tormented by him, and a statement was incapacitated that four people had been deprived of life by his altacks. To sow evil, the inhabitants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as I supposed to be visual in the oasis of vampyrism) fresh, and enlire free of coruptian, and omit in the mouth, nose, and ears, pure and florid blood. As the evidence was obtained, they resorted to the usual remedy. A stake was driven entirely through the heart and badger of Arriold Paul, where he is reported to have arched over as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut his head, burned his body, and threw the bases into his grave. The same measures were adopted with the course of the people who had already died of vampyrism, for fear that they should, in turn, receive 6 genes on the others who survived them.\nThe universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre itself, and sucks in its turn.\nA judicial officer.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is linked here. It seems better suited to the subject matter of these observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered a kind of punishment after death, for some hejnous crime committed whilst in existence, that the deceased is not only sentenced to vampyrise, but could to make his Those whom he loved, while he was on earth — those to whom he was bound by lies of kinship and affection. — A silence of support referred to the \"Giaou r\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, Thy horn shall come out of his tomb; and hate the native room, and suck the blood of every race: from thence of the daughter, sister, wise, about midnight drain the stream of life; yet hate the banquet which by force must feed the living chore, Thy victims, which are yet exhaling, shall know the devil for their sire. You curse them like sheep, your waves are swallowed up on the limb. But so far as your crime must fall, the youngest, beloved of AlI, bless him with the name of a father — The hot word will wrap your coffin in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last tint of his cheek, the last spark of his eye, and the vitreous gaze lasl must hide that freezes his lifeless blue; then with canceled the hand will tear the braids of yellow hair ber, of which Iri life a lock when the deep pledge of affection has been carried — But now is corned by the memorial of your agony! And yet, thou has the best drop of water, thy grinning tooth, the arid lip of the hook; then the harking to the tomb, go, and with Gouls and Afrits rave, until these in horror shririk far from fromspectre more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also introduced him to his wild but beautiful poem of \"Thalaba\", the vampire Corsican of the servant Arclbian Orieiza, which is represented as David returned from the grave in order to torment him that she loved better during her existence. But this cannot be supposed to be a whole result from the finesse of his life, it has been spilled over the whole tale as a complete type of purity and innocence. The veritable Tournefort gives a long rush in its lravols of several cases astoriishirig of vampyrisrn, to which he claims to have been an eyewitness; and Calmet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and draditionary narratives illustriate-\nThe view of its effects, put forward some leamed dissertations, harassing to prove that it is a classical, as well as barbaric error.\nMany serious and interesting opinions about its singularly horrible superstition are added; although the present can suffice for the limits of a note, necessarily consecrated to explanatiori, and which can now be concluded by mercly remarking, that if the term Vampyre is that in the most general acceptance, here are several other synonyms in the mind, makes use of in various parts of the world: like Vroucolocha, Vardovlacha, Gou1, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that in the kinds of accompanying dicipations during a London winter, it appeared to the various parts of the bone loaders, a ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he did not participate. Apparently, the light laughter of the air attracted only his attention, so that he could by a jeook choke him, and throw the fear into the breasts where carelessness reigned. Those who felt this feeling of apprehension could not explain from where it came from: some attributed it to the dead grey eye, which, six on the space of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance to pierce through the inner works of the thick earl; but fell on the cheek with a ray of lead that weighed upon the skiri that he could not pass. His peculiarities used him to be invited to all the houses; all wanted to see him, on those who had been accustomed to violent excitement, and now felt the weight of him, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging their attention. In spite of the emotion of passion, it is a beautiful emotion on the part of the hunter woman, after having tried to seize him, and to win. In her turn, some marks of what could be called affection: Lady Mercor, who was the mockery of all the monsters in the drawing rooms since her marriage, fought on his way, arid only put on the dress of a Montagnard bank, to attract attention :— though in vain :— when he stood before hjm, although his cyes were apparently fixed on the hors, still he seemed bone if they were not percevod ;—everi hcr inappalled impudence was baffled, and she left the field. But adultery ornmon could not influence even the guidance of the eyes bis, it was not that the female sex was indifferent to him: yet this was the apparent prudence with which he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, that few knew that he was speaking to women. He had, however, the reputation of a winning tone; and that it was that even he overcame the fear of his singular character, or that they were inovated by his appearancel hatred of love, he was often among those women who formed the boasting of their sex from the domestic ir virtues, as among those who jostling her by their vices.\nAround the time of the samo, the Landon, a young man of the boss name Aubrey: he was a clean orphari left with only one sister in the possession of great wealth, by the parents who died while he was still in the ehil. Left to him, too, by guardians, who simply took care of his fortune, while they abandoned an important charge of his mind to the interest of subaltern mercenaries, he cultivated more basic imagination than his judgment. He therefore had this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, which every day ruines so many learnings of thousands. He believed everything to sympathize with virtue, arid thought that the vice was thrown by Pravidenee simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, as we see in romances: he thought that the misery of a cottage consisted simply of the vest of clothes, which were as hot, but which were better suited to the eye of the pclinter by their irregular sales and various colorod patches. It was the reality of life. He is beautiful, frank and rich: for these reasons, when he entered the into gay circles, in no mother svrovrided him, by striving who could describe the truth, loast their favorite Ianguishing or grunt: the girls of the same time, by the whirlwind of faces when he climbed, and by their sparkling eyes, when he worked his lips, he quickly led to false notions of his talents and merit. Attached as he was to the aroma of his solitary hours, he was surprised to discover that, except in the tallow and candles of wax that clickered, not of the presence of a ghost, but of lack of snuffing, there was no foundation in real life in one of these congreries of pleasant images and descriptions contained in these volumes, from which he had formed his studies. Finding, inclining, a little compensation in his gratified vanity, he was about to give up his dream, what is the extraordinary being that we have above described, crossed him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the impassibity itself of forming an idea of the character of a man absorbed into himself, who gave other signs of his observation of external objects, that the place according to their existence, involved in the avoidance of contact with him: allowing his imagination to trap everything that flattered his propensity to extravagant ideas, he soon formed this object to the hero of a novel, and decided to observe the outpouring of his fantasies, rather than the person who preceded it. He became familiar with him, paid attention to him, and so far advanced to his opinion, that the presence of this was still recognized. He gradually learned that Lord Ruthvens affairs were embarrassed, and soon, according to the prayer notes in — Street, he realized that he was about to travel. Desiring to obtain some informal rospeeting this singular character, which, until now, had only brandished his curiosity, he haunted his guards, that it was time for him to make the tour, which, during generations, many af we thought necessary to burden the young to take a few quick steps in the career of vice towards pvting themselves on equality with the old, and not to allow them to appear as so far as heaven, which is not scandalous aro rentionate intrigues as subjects of pleasantness or praise, according to the degree of skill that there is to listen to them. They consented: and Aubrey immediately evoking his jenteritions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to make him from a proposal to ioin. Flatterod by such a mark of esteem of him, who, apparently, had nothing in common with other women, he readily accepted it, and it a few days they had spent the surrounding waters.\nSo far, Au Brey does not have the opportunity to study Lord Stevens caroctor, and now he has four, that, although many others of his actions have compared to his view, the results have made different conclusions of the opposite motives to his conduct. His companion was abundant in his liberality ;—theidle, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not help but point out that it was not on the virtuous, reduced to indignation, even on virtue, that he gave his alarms ;- these were the sneezes of the door with sneezes barely repressed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to let him harden himself in the lust bis, or to sink him even deeper into his iniquity, he was sent away with a rich charity. This, however, was attributed to the greater import of the vicious, which generally outweighs the absenteeism of the virtuous indigent. There was a circumftarice about the charity of his Lordship, which was still rnoré improssed on his mind: all those on whom he was granted, irievitobly found shot there was a curse on her, because they were all led to the scaffold, or sank to arid the lowest misery object. In Brussels and in other cities through which they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the apparent impatience of his companion sougbt for the centres of al 1 vlce in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the table of foro: he gagged, and always played with suooess, except where he knew stronger was his antagonlst, and then he even lost rnore that he won; but it was always with the same faee, with which he generally looked at society around: it was not, however, when he met the eruption young navicc, or the unlucky father of a family number just; then his very desire seemed to be the law of fortune — this apparent abstraction of the spirit which he had set aside, and his eyes shrouded with innore firc that of the cat who daltered with half-dead movse. In each city, he left the old rich yuth, torn from the circle, he decorated, cursed, in tbo solitudo of o donjon, the fate that had attracted him to the reach of this field; while many a father sat frantically, in the midst of the labs of hungry mutes, without a single farthing of this lot of immense wealth, where to buy of the cuen enough to satisfy their present desire. Yet he did not take money from the playable; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of many, the last order that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result to a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, capable of fighting the trick of the most experienced. Aubrey often began to represent this to his friend, and begged him to restate this charity and pleasure which proved the ruin of all, and the riots tended to his own profit ;— and he delayed him —for on the same day, his friend would give him an opportunity to speak frankly and professionally; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthvon in his car, and in the midst of various wild and rich backgrounds of nature, was always the same: his city spoke less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near the object of his curiosity, he did not obtain any more gratification than he constructed apart from wanting vainly to break this mystery, which at his exaute imagination began to take on the appearance of something supernatural.\nThey soon arrived in Rome, and Aubrey lost a time of sight of his companion; he left him in the daily workshop on the morning circle of a Countess of Italian, while he went in search of the memorials of another dese-\nIt is the city. While he was so engaged, letters came from England, which he opened with impatience; the first was from his sister, breathing not having but affection; the others were his guardians, the latter surprised him; if he had before entered into his imagination, there was an evil power residing in his companion, they seemed to give them enough reason for delusion. His guards insisted on his immediately leaving his friend, and exhorted that his character was terribly vicious, because the possession of irritable powers of education made his licentious habits more dangerous to the self. It had been discovorous, that this contempt for the adultrus had not been born in hatred of his character; but that he had demanded, in order to harass his gralegy, that his victim, the associate of his guilt, had thrown himself the pinccle of the unsweeted virtuoso, dowri to the lowest abyss of infamy and degradation: in the end, that all those females whom he had shuddered, apparently because of their virtue, hcld, since his departure, even threw the mask, and had not scrupulously exposed the whole deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose ch character had again not shown a cell only light pear on which to rest the eye. He resolved to invent a plausible pretext for abandoning the thing completely, seeking, in the average while, to look at it more closely, and not to let pass any slight circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon to be seen that his Lordship was dying to work on the inexperience of the lady's daughter, of whom he mainly frequented the house. In Italy, it is rarely that an unmarried woman is met in society; he was tired of wearing his plons in secret; but Aubreys eye followed him in all his windings, and soon discussed that an assignment had been ascribed, which would probably end in the ruin of an innocent, though insensitive, girl. When he did not lose time, he entered Lord Ruthvens party, and asked him arduously his intentions with respect to your lady, informing a bim at the same time that he was aware of his behavior to meet her that night. Lord Ruthven replied that his intentions were such that he assumed that all would have had such an opportunity; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply ugly. Aubrey withdrew, and immediately, writing a novel, to say, that from that time he had to refuse to accompany his Lordship in the rest of the proposed visit, he ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informing him of all that he knew, not only with regard to his daughter, but also with regard to the baracter of his Lordfhip. The Assigration was avoided. Lord Rulhven noxt day simply sent his secret to inform his full assertion to a sepclration; bvt a right hlnt any susplicion of his plans having been thwarted by Aubreyf interposition.\nAfter leaving Rome, Avbrey directed the steps from this to Greece, and crossed the peninsula, soon found at Thehenf. He then fixed his residence in the house a Greek one; and soon occupied gluteIf by tracing the faded traces of gloomy annoyed on the tbatap monumerits apparently, slammed to chronicle the acts of Freomen only in front of the slaves, had hidden under the tight ground or many colored lichen. Under the same roof as him, there existed being, so beautiful and delicate, that she could have formed the model of a painter who used to spread ori oanvas the promised hope of the faithful in Mohammed's paradise, except that her eyes spoke to a lot of mind so that someone thought that she could belong to those who did not have souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled along the side of the mountain, one would have thought the gazelle of poor lype of her beauties; for what it would have been had she exchanged her eye, apparently the eye of animated nature, for that drowsy look luxurious bone, the animal adapted but to the taste of an epic. The light stage of Ian Ulubrey often accompanied in his search for antiquities, and often wovld the girl unconsciovs, engaged in the pursuit of a buttorfly of Kashmere, showed all the beauty of his form, floating as he was on the wind, to the greedy look of him, who forgave the letters that he had just deciphered on a tablet almost erased, in the contemplation of his figure of sylpha. Often, her braids fell, or she was scattered, displayed in the ray of the sun such delicately brilliant and quickly soothing shades, this could excuse the oblivion of the antiquarian, who escaped from his mind the very object that he had before thinking of the vital impertinence to the irriterpretation proper from a passage in Pausanias. Bul why try to describe the damage that everyone feels, but nono can appreciate ?— It was innocence, young, and healthy, disused by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. While he drew these remains of which he wished to reserve a memorial for his future hours, she stood up, and looked at the magio effects of the hif penoil, tracing the scenes of his native place; she would then describe him the dance turning on the open plain, painted, him in all the brilliant colors of the youthful memory, the marriage pump that she remembered seeing her childhood; and then, turning to the whole subjects had obviously shaped a greater impression on his mind, would tell him the supernatural stories of her nurse. His sincerity and his apparent belief in what she was telling, excited Aubrey's furnace of interest; and often as she told her the story of living uampyre, who had passed through the midst of her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful woman to prolong her existence for the months that followed, his blood rvn eold, what1st he tried to ridicule her ossucb idle and horrible fantclsies; but Iantbe quoted her the names of an old meridian, who had finally detected one living among them, after several of their close relatives and children had been found marked with the ampli of the oppetite of the fien; and when she found that he was so incredulous, she begged him to believe her, for it had noticed that those who dared to question the existence, had always had evidence, which oliged, with pain and tear, for the eifess it was true. She detailed the traditional operance of these monsters bimly, and her horror was magnified, with a rather precise description of Lord Ruthven; how, however, still persisted on persuading her, that there would be no truth in her fears, although at the same time he wondered about the many eoincidences that had all turned to excite a belief in Lord Ruthueris supernatural power.\nAubrey began to grieve more aridly at Ianthe; his innoence, so contrasted with all the affected virtues of the women among whom he had sought his vision of love, gained his heart; and as he ridiculed the idea of a young man of English babits, marrying a Greek without instruction, he found himself still more and more attached to the form of an almost fairy before leaving. He sometimes ripped off from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquarian research, he left, determined not to return until his object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix the attention bis on the ruins around him, which in the bis spirit he kept an image that seemed olono the legitimizing of bis thoughts. Nathan was a uriconscient of his love, and always the same frank child that he had known for the first time. She always managed to separate from him with reluctance; but it was because she had no one with whom she could see her appetites, while her guardian was occupied in the sketch or discovery of a fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appeared to her parents on the underjeet of Vampyres, afraid they both, with several present, confirmed their existence, cling with horror to the very name. Soon Aubrey decided to proceed on one of his excreslons, which he had to detach for a few hares; when they heard the dwarf of the place, all at once begged of bim nol to come back at night, for he had to necessarily pass through a wood, where no Greek could ever be rebuked, after the closing of the day, to serious consideration. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced most of the heavy evils as approaching the one who dared to cross their way. Aubrey Madc highl of their representations, and tried to laugh at the idea; but when he saw them shudder at his audacity so as to mock a superior, insernal power, whose very name apparently made their hood freeze, he was silent.\nThe next morning, Aubrey left on his unattended excursion; he was surprised to observe the face of his host, and he was confounded to see that his words, mocking the belief of those horrible ones, had inspired them to such a terror. Whenhe was hastened to leave, Ianthe came to the side of his horse, and earnestly begged him for revenge, and allowed the power of the beings of the class to be put into action ;— he promised. Ho was, however, so busy in his research, that he did not perceive that the light of the day would be so fine, and that in the borizon there was one of these flies which, in the warmer climates, so patiently gathorinto a huge mass, and pour out all their rage on the devoted country .— He finally, however, mounted his horse, determinod to compensate by the speed for his delay: but he was taole. The twilight, in these southern cultures, is almost unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night begins: and it was aduanced far away, the storm's power was above — its exuberant thunders had barely a resting interval — they thick heavy rain forced his way through the eanopying foliage, while the forked blue light swallowed to fall and radiate to hif fever. Suddenly, his horse became afraid, and he was led quickly dreadsul through the tangled forest. The animal finally, through fatigue, stopped, and found, hy, the dazzling of lightning, that it was in the neighborhood of a hovol that hardly got up from the masses of dead leaves and brush...\nGood around him. Demonstrating, he approaches, hoping to find someone to guide him to the station, or at least have confidence to get a shelter against the storm. As he approached, the thundors, for a silent moment, let him hear the terrible cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation and exulting laughter, contaminating in one almost an uninterrupted sound ;— he was surprised: blue, stirred again by thunder, groaned on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut. He bowed in darkness, but the sound guided him. Ho was apparently imporced; for, although he called, the continued sounds, and no advice from him was taken. He found himself in contact with someone who was seized immediately; when a man cried ,\" Again baffied! \", to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt harassed by him whose strength seized superhumans: determined to sell his life as clearly as he had it, he read; but he was at Valn: he was left by his sensation and angry by the energizing force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself on hlm, and the kneeler on the chest, hcld placed his hands bis on his tbroate — when the abyss of many torches penetrating through the hole that gave light in the day, the trouble ;— he rose up instantly, and, leaving his prey, rushed through the door, and in an instant tho crashling of the branches, as he broke the wood, was no longer heard. The storm was still there, and Aubrey, iricapable to move, was soon heard by those without. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the valleys of mud, and the thatched loaded on every heavy with straw flakes of sole. At Auhreys desire, they sought her who had attracted her by shouting; he went back into the darkness; but what was her horror, when the light of the torchef once more burst into her, to perceive the aerial form of her beautiful conductor brought into a course without life. He closed his eyes, saying that it was only a vision from his troubled imagination; but he saw again the same form, if he shut them, lying by his side. There was no color on his cheek, not even on his lip; however, the there was still 1ness on his face that felt almost as attached as life was there :— on his neck squats blood, and on his throat were marks of teelh having opened the vein :— to this men points, crying, simultaneousously struck with horror ,\" In Vampyre! A vampire !\" A little was quickly abandoned, and Aubrey was laid beside her who had latoly been this subject to so many brilliant and fairy visions, now fell clean with the flower of life that had died in her. He did not know what he thought — his mind was eaten up and seemed to escape reflection, and to take refuge in the vacuum — he held in his hand a bare dagger of a particular construction, which had been found in the cabin. They were soon welcomed by different parties who had engaged in the search for beer that a mother had missed. Their lamentable crying, as they approached the city, foretold the parents of a terrible catastrophe. \"Describe their grief would be impossible; but when they checked the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, and pointed towards the Corsican. They were inconsolable, both died in a broken heart.\nAubreyêtre put to bed was seized with a very violent fever, and was delusional of delusion; in these incredulous he would call on Lord Ruthven and on Ianthe—by an incompetent combination, he complained of begging his former companion to spare the beloved being. At other times, he threw himself on the head of imprecise maldictions, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity to arrive in Athens, and, fleeing any motive, after hearing Aubreys style, immediately dragged himself into the same house, and became his cannon escort. When he recovered from his delirium, he was horrified and astonished at the sight of him whose image he now had combined with that of a Vampyre; but Lard Rulbven, by his kind words, involving almost repentance for the fault which had coincided with their separation, and even more by the attention, the emphasis, and more of which was shown, soon reconciled with his presence. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he no longer appeared that apathetic being who had so surprised Aubrey; but as soon as the bis recovery began to be creepy, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey perceived no differentoe of the old man, except that sometimes he was surprised to meet bis gaze fixed interitly on him, with a smile of maliciovsexullation playing on his lips: he knew not why, but this smile failed. During the last period of recovery of the riverllid, Lord Rvthven apparently undertook to capture the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or iri marking the progress of those orbs, turning, like our world, the motionless sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by shock, weakens a lot, and this elasticity of the spirit had once distinguished him so well now seemed to be running away forever. Today he was also a lover of the salitude and silence of Lord Ruthven; but as long as he desired solitude, his spirit did not find him in the vicinity of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruiris which he had previously frequented, the form of Ianthe stood by his side — if he sought him in the woods, his slight step seemed to drool in the middle of the undergrowth, in q uesl de lho modeste violel; then suddenly turnniriground, would show, with his wild irgination, his pale face spanned his wounded throat, with a sweet smie upon his lips. He decided to steal the scenes, all of which created such bitter associates in his mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthventa that he was bound by the earth care he mistaked from him during his Illness, that they should visit the parts of Greece the scholar had seen again. They passed through every diroclion, and looked for all the places to which a memory could be attached: bvl though they cleaned from the place in place, but they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to digest these reports, which they imagined as the invention of individuals, whose interest was to excite the generosity of those whom they draped from the supposed dangers. As a result, they did not take into account the advice of the inhabitants, they once traveled only a few guards, more to serve as guides to the class than in defense. By committing themselves, however, a narrow layer, at the bottom of which, was the bed of a torrent, with large masses of rocks descended from the nearby precipices, they reasoned to repent of their negligence; for there was hardly the whole party engaged in the narrow pass, when they were put into the water by the whistling of bullets near the head of toir, and by the echoed ratio of sev-\nThe Guns. In an accident, their guards left them, and, placing them behind the rocks, they started firing in the direction from which the camo report. Lord Ruthuen and Aubrey, abandoning their example, withdrew for a moment behind the glimmer of defilement: but shameful to be so owned by an enemy, who, with the insult of the Badethem shovels, advanced, and to be exposed to the slaughter of urine, if one of the robbers were to go up above and take them to the rear, they immediately went out to rush in search of the enemy. Hardly had lost shelter from the rock, when Lord Ruthven received a shot in this rubbish, which brought him to the grurid. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, na longcr taking into account the contest or his own circle, was soon surprised to see the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthveri was wounded, thrown immediately his arms and handed over.\nBy the promises of a great reward, Aubrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded friend to a nearby hut; and, agreeing on a ransom, he was no longer troubled by their presence — they were simply plotting the entrance until their comrade came back with the promised sum, for which he had an order. Lord Ruthvens strength diminished rapidly; in two days the morlisication followed, and death seemed to progress with hasty steps. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been of the objects; but towards the end of the evening, his mind proved uncomfortable, and his eye often fixed on Aubrey, who provoked his donkey with more than the usual order –\" Help me! You can save me – you can do more than that – I mean that my life, I have listened to death if my existence is as little as that of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your friend. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I could have done anything ,\" replied Aubrey. \"I am very lucky, my life weakens, I can excuse the whole thing, but if you hide everything you know from me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if my death was unleashed for a while in England, I was exploding. \"—\"He won't be drunk. \"Swcar !\" cried the dying man, raising his sons to the exultant violence ,\"Swear by all your walkers, by all your nature, swearthal, a year and a day that you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to any living being, whatever the rainy haperi, or whatever you can see. \" His eyes seemed to burst with shrouded sockets :\" I sweat !\" said Aubrey; he ran down his pillow, and breathed no more.\nAubrey rested, but did not rest; many circumstances having informed him of this man rose up on his mind, and he did not know. why; when he joined his oath, a cold chill came upon him, as if from the presentation of something horrible waiting for him. Rising early in the morning, he was about to crack the house in which he had left the corpse, when a thief the methim, and informed him that there was no loring there, having been transported by himself and his comrades, on his withdrawal, to the pinriacle of a nearby mountain, in accordance with a promise that they had given to his secretary, that he should be exposed to the first cold ray of the inoan that arose after his death. Aubrey is astonished, and takes the severe of men, dissuades from going to bury him in the place where he is prostituted. But when he had mounted on the light, he found no trace of the corpse or drapes, although the thieves swore that they were reporting the same rock on which he had laid the body. For his mind was perplexed in conjectures, but he finally returned, convinced that they had buried the body for the good of clothes.\nWeary of a hoax in which he had encountered such terrible misfortunes, arid in which all apparently conspired to heigblen superstitious thal melancholic that had seized on his mind, he resolved to leave him, and soon arrived at Smyrna. While waiting for a ship to transport it to Otranto, or Naplès, he occupied it by arranging these effects, he had with him a blowing to Lord Luther. Among other things, there was one case containing several tsaporis of offence, more or less adapted 10 to ensure the death of the victim. There were daggers and atagharis. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forerunners, what was his surprise to find o sheaths apparently or named in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he shuddered — eager to get further evidence, he found the weapon, and bishor can be imagined when he discovers that he adapted, although in a special shape, lehoalh that he held in his hand. His eyes did not seem to need a stealthy certainty: the sip seemed to bind to the dagger; but he still wanted to distract himself; but the particular shape, the same varied shades on the shaft and the sheath were similar in the splendor on both, and left no chamber for the doubl; there were also drops of blaod on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and orientated his way back to Rome. His first investigations focused on the lody he had tried to rip off the seductive arts of Lard Ruthven. Her parents were in distress, their fortune ruined, and she had not been a child since the detachment of her secretary. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many horrors repeated; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of Ian Ho. He became morose and silent; and his only oocupation was to exhort the speed of the postjlions, if he went to save the life of someone he held dear. He arrived in Calais; a breoze, which seemed obedient to his will, soon to be thrown hiin on the banks of the English; and he hastened to the home of his fathers, and there, for a moment, seemed to lose, in his kisses and listens to his sister, all the memory of the past. If before, by her infantile caresses, she had gained her affection, now that the woman began to appear, she was even more athletic as a comparison.\nMiss Aubrey didn't have that winning grace that won the eyes and applause of the drawing-room assemblies. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the warm atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye has never been illuminated by the levity of the benefit spirit. There was a melancholic charm the about who did not have a secm to emerge from malfortunc, but from a caring feeling with ln, which appears to indicate a soul conscious of a more brilliant kingdom. His step was not that light foot, which errandswhereer a butterfly or moyattract color — it was sedate and pensive. When alone, her space was enlightened by the smile of joy; even when her brother broke her affection, and would be in her presence forget the sorrows that she knew to destroy her rest, who would have excavated her smile for that of the euluptaire? It seemed that these eyes, hat faces were playing in the light of their own natal sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought by her guardians that her presentation should be delayed until her brother returned to the continent, when he could be his master. That was now, that was why, solved the next show, which was approaching quickly, should be the efooh of his entry into the \"abuse scene. \"Aubrey would have walked in the house of his fathers, and fed melancholy that had given him the power. He did not feel interested in fashioned strangers' treats, when his mind had been so torn apart by the events he had seen; but he decided to sacrifice his own comfort to the protection of his sister. They soon arrived in the city, and prepared for the next day, which had been rinsed like a living room.\nThe crowd of Tbe was in excess: a living room had not been held for a long time, and also who was anxious to rest in the smile of the kingship, rushed there. Aubrey was there with her sister. What did he do in a corner of himself, without taking into account all that was around him, that he remembered that the first time he had seen was there, that he suddenly felt seized by the arm, and that a voice which he recognized too well, sounded to his ear :\"Remember your oath .\" He had a little courage to turn, fearing seeing the specter that would blaser him, when he perceived, at a little distance, the same figure that had attracted his police such a place when he first entered society.\nYes. He was watching until his almost limbs refused to wear their cold blood.\nHe was forced to take the arm of a friar, and to force a passage to the crowd, he threw himself in his car, and was taken home. He passed over the room with shouting steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that thoughts, he would burst out of his brain. Lord Steven again before him — the circumstances began in the dreadful array — the dagger — his oath. — He woke up himself, he could riot nice c possible — the dead rise again! e :— He thought his evil imagination conjured the image on which his mind was based. It was impossible that it could be real — so he decided to go again instacity; for tangb he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hanging on his lips, and he could not succeed in giving information. He left a few nights after his sister's death at the emblem of a close relationship. Leaving her under the protection of a matron, he retired to a process, and there he gave himself to his own devours. Perceiving, finally, which many were leaving, he dried up, and entering another room, found his sister surrounded by several, apparently in serious convulsion; he tried to pass by and approach her, when one, whom he asked to move, turned, and rebuked him those feces that he had made abharred. He went forward, took hold of his sister's arm, and, with a hurry, pressed her to the foot.\nAnd: the gate which he found himself hindered by the multitude of servants who lamented for their lords; and while he took care of making it, he heard that voice whispering beside him :«Remember the aath! », he dared not to turn, but, burry sister, soon arrived at home.\nAubrey became almost distracted. So before it was absorbed by a subject, how much more completely it was absorbed, now than the certainty of the monster's life again prefects his thoughts. Her sister's attention was no longer listened to, and it was in vain that she invited her to expose her to what had cavized her abrupt product. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he ate, the more disconcerted he was. His oats surprised him ;— was he to allow this monster to wander, bearing a rule on his breath, in the midst of all that he cherished, did he not cling to his progress? His sister was touched by him. But if he had to break his oath, and reveal his suspicions, who would believe him? He thought that he would intrude his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but death, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he reincarnated himself in this state; locked in this room, he saw no one, and ate only when his sister Carne, who, eyos spirit flowing with tears, begs him, for his false, sustains nature. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered through the street of Sroom, anxious to steal this image that haunted him. His dress became neglected, and he wandered, as often exposed at midnight, even as to the light darnps. He was no greater than he had been recognized; at the end of the year he took refuge in the house, but at last he lay down to the rest where he was surprised by the fatigue. his sister, anxious for her safety, worked the clog for the followers; but they quickly distanced themselves by them who were fleeing the stunning of a pursuer only any — of the thought. His conduct, however, suddenly changed. Struck by the idea that he left by his absenee, he all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he determined to enter society again, and to look at him closed, arixieux to predict, despite his oath, all that Lord Ruthven approached with intjmacy. But when he entered a room, this chluggard and suspicious looked so dizzying, his inner chills were so visible, that his sister was finally forced to beg for him to deceive, for her, a society that affected him so strongly. When, however, the demonstration proved inavailing, the guards thought appropriate to interpose, engaged, fearing that his mind became alienated, they tangbl it high time to remind me that which trust had been before imposed on them by Aubrey parents.\nDesiring to save the hair from the wounds and sufferings that he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent bim from exposing to the general eye, the marks of what they corisidcred madness, they instructed a doctor to reside in the house, and to take care of him constantly. He hardly seemed to notice, if completely his mind was absorbed by a terrifying subject. His inconsistency finally became so great that he was confined to his room. He often lied for days, unable to be woken up. He had fainted, his eyes had reached a glazed chandelier ;— the only sign of affection and memory remaining exposed at the entrance of his sister; then he would begin, and, taking his hands, with the eyes that touched him greatly, he desired that she should not touch him. \"Oh, don touch him, it is your love for me, don't come near him !\" Where, however, she asked whom he was referring to, her only mercy was ,\"True !\" and a gain that he sank in a slate, from which even she could roam him. This has lost many months: graduated, however, as the year passed, his incoherences are less frequent, and his mind has thrown a part of his morosity, whip his observed guards, than several times in the doy he counted on his fingers, a defined number, and then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, one of his guards entering his room began to converse with his physiclan on the melancholic circumstances of Aubreys being in such a terrible situation, when his sister was going the next day to get married. Aubreys immediate attention fainted; he became anxiously angry with whom. Happy with this mark of the return of the intellect, of which they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the name of the Count of Marsden. Thinking that he was a young count that he had hid mel with in society, Aubrey seems to plead, and amazes even more by his exposure with his intention to be present at the nuptials, and desire to see his sister. They did not answer, but in a few minutes, his sister was with him. He was apparently an ego capable of being affected by the influence of the beautiful beer smile; for he pressed her to his breast, and kissed his cheek, wet with leeches, running to the thought of his bra being once again happy at the expense of affection. He began to talk with all the his desired warmth, and to congratulate her on her marriage with a person so distanced for the rank and every accomplishment; when he suddenly perceived a lock on his chest; opening it, the whale was surprised to see the characteristics of the monster that had so long influenced life. He seized the portrail in a paroxysm of rage, and the pietina under foot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resombolaric of her future husband, he looked as if he did not understand her —thon seizi was grating her heels, and looked at her with a frenetic expression of eunleriance. He made swear her that she would never marry this monster, for he—but he could not move forward —he saw as if this voice of a new bade hirn remembered his oath—he turned with turn of turn, thinking that Lard Ruthven was near him but saw no one. Meanwhile, the guards and the doctor, who had heard the whole thing, and the thought that was only a reminder of his disorder, entered, and removed him from Miss Aubrey, pushed her to leave him. He fell on his knees, yours, begged to delay them, but for one day. They attached this to the folly they imagined had taken possession of his spirit, worshipped him, pacifying, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthven had clenched in the morning after the living room, and had been refused with all the others. When he heard Aubreys disease, he easily understood the cause of the disease; but when he learned that he was considered mad, exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had acquired this computerian. He hastened to the bosom of the former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the pretense of great affection for the brother and interest in the high fato, he gradually gained Miss Aubreys ear. Who resists his power? His tongue had dangers and toils to tell – could speak of himself as an individual believing, no sympathy with a being on the crowded earth, except with the one to whom he addressed ;— could say how, since he knew hor, his existence, had begun to seem worthy of conservation, if it were inert that he could listen to his bloody accents ;— Jan sine, he knew so well how to use the alarm of the serpent, or subb was the will of destiny, that he won his affections. Tbe a little of the eldest branch falling to the length to him, he obtained great carelessness, which served as an excuse to haveten the marriage ,( in spite of the state of derariness of his brother ,) which was to take place the day before his departure for the continent TB.\nAubrey, while left by the doctor on his guard, tried to run for the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a popor; just was given to him; he wrote a letter to his sister, conjuring her, as she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of those who are now in the grove, who once held her in their arms as their boop and the hope of their house, to delay both a sewn of the hours of this marriage, on which he denounced the heavy foot-cover of mofl. The servants promised that they would abandon him; but in giving this to the doctor, he thought that it was better not to harass Miss Aubricy's mind any more by, what he regarded as a cd, the gratings of a maniac. The night passed without rest to the detained body of the house; and Aubrey heard, with horror or which can more easily be conceived than described, notes of busy preparation. The morning came, the smile of the cars broke on the big ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants, at last, gradually fled, leaving him in the custody of an old helpless woman. He seized the opportunity, with a tie, was out of the room, and in a moment was in the apartment where all was almost sambled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive the hjm: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, he shook him from the storm, said Iss with fury. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his ear :\"Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my blunder today, that your fist is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So, he said, he pushed him to his servants, who, awakened by the old woman, had come looking for him. Aubrey could no longer beg himself; his rage found no ventilation, had broken a blood vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was celebrated, and the bride and bridegroom left London.\nThe weakness of Aubrey increased; bloodshed produced symptoms of near-death approximation. He wanted to be called his sister's guards, and when the hour of the night had struck, he told in a composite way that the reader had perpetuated, because he died immediately afterward.\nThe guards called in to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they got in, it was too late. Lord Heaven had disappeared, and Aubrey's sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT OF A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF the LORD BYRON IN THE ISLAND OF MITYLENE.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was before him, where to choose his place of rest, and Providence his guide .\"\nIN Sailing via Greek Arophipelago, on board one of the ships of bis Majestyf, in the year 1812, we spent in the port of Mitylene, on the island of that name. The beauty of his place, and the supply of sweets and vegetables which must always be there, bring many ships to visit him, warmen and merchants; and he is away from the track for the ships bound in Smyrna, his bonuses quickly reimburse the Deviltian of a voyage. We landed, as usual, at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to water, and the shipowner negotiated for Cattlo with the natives, the ecclesiastical, and I took a ramble to the school of Homer, and to other places where we had been established. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound named ). We met and hired a young Greek like our guide, who told us that he had come from Scio with an English lard, who left the island four toys before we arrived in his felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and would take me with him; but I did not choose to leave Mitylerie, where I am likely to freeze married. He was a weird man, but he was very obsessed. The house above the hill, facing the river, belongs to him, and he left an old man to charge him: give Dominick, the winemaker, fix a hundred zechins for her ,( about L 250 English currency ,) arid lived there about fourteen months, though not constantly; for he sails in his felucca very often towards the various islands .\"\nThis account greatly expiated our euriosity, and we did not waste time, hastening at the house where our compatriot had reduced. We were greeted by an old man, who led us over the mansion. It consisted of apartments located on the ground floor, an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room and a bed-ornate, with a spacious and anxious closet. They were all simply decorated: grace walls, marble tables on the either side, a large myrtle in the center, and a small fountain beneath, which could be made to play through the branches by moving a source fixed on the side of a small hronze Venus iri, a loan posture; a sofa or sofa largo completed the furniture. In the hall stood half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty bookcase: there were not mirrors, nor a single painting. The bedroom had only one largo mattress or float, with two cotton duvets and a glitter pillow, the common outfit throughout Greece. In the living room, we observed unstoppable dreams. Once, the old man said of, filled with books and papers, which were then in the trunk of a great sailor on the fence: it was open, but we did not think we justified ourselves to examine the taleries. On the tahlet of the recreation poses Voitaire, Shakespeare, Boileau, and the works of Roussoau eomplete; the Ruins of Emplres of Volncy; Zimmerman, in German; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Kotzebue; the play of Schiller of the Robbers; the Paradise of Miltan Lost, an edition of Italion, printed in Parma in 1810; several small pamphlets of the Greek press in Constantinoplo, much torn, but no English book of any description whatsoever. Most of these books were filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian and Latin. The Messiah was literally scratched everywhere, and bitten with a brief piece of paper, which were also reinarks.\nThe old Mccan said :\"The Lord had read books of these in the evening before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, he said, they must lie there until he turns; for it is so special that I had to move something without orders, which would frown me together for a week; it is otherwise very good. One day I did him a favor; I had the product of this form for the work of taking care of it, with the exception of twenty zechins which I paid to an elderly Armenian who resides in a small cottage in the wood, and which the lord brought here from Adrianople; I do not know why .\"\nThe operation of the house outside was pleasant. The porlico at the front was fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the split marble pilars with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a light stone façade, was covered with a hard Turkey carpet, beneath a strong coarse lineer awning. Most of the roofs of the house are thus shaved, as on them, the Greeks spend their evening smoking, drinking eight wines, like \"lachryma Christmas christi\", eating fruit, and enjoying the evening breeze.\nOn the left hand, as we entered the house, a small ftreamlet glided, grapes, oranges and lindens gathered on its borders, and under the shadow of two large bushes of myrtle, a marble seat with an ornamental wood back was placed, on which we have worked lold, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights till twelve clocks, reading, writing, and lalking to bimseif. \"I beg your pardon\" said the old man ,\"playing\" because he was very fervent ,\" and always frequented our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays .\"\nThe view of this seat was what could be called a bird view. A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive and myrtle Iri flower, and on the top of which an ancient Greek temple appeared in the majestic decay. A small stream from the ruins descended from the broken waterfalls of the river, until it was lost in the woods near the base of the mountain. The smooth bone glass of the sea, and a horizontal unskinned by a single cloud, finishes the view in front; and a little to the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several Sinall islands were observed distinctly, spanning the light blue wave with spots of green. I had a view of tuna pond I did that; but our requests were unsuccessful as to the name of the Persian who had resided in romantic solitude this: no one knew his name but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian,\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I sure he won\" and carinot you said, old friend ?\" I said ,\"If I can,\" he exclaimed ,\"I don't dare\". We did not have time to visit the Armenian, but upon our return to the city, we learned the several details of the island lord. He had shared eight young girls when he was last on the island, and even dariqued with the wedding party. He gives a cow to an inan, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who weave these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisberman who had lost his own wind blow, and he often gave Greek Testaments to poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been a very eccentric and influential character. Dried circumstances that we learned, that our old friend at the cottage considered appropriate not to disclose. He had a very beautiful daughter, with whom the Lord often walked by the sea, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and had taught him how to use it.\nThese are the elements of the formation that we left from the island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing that this logger in Greece covered being. He had money that he was given: he had dispasitiori philarithropy, and all the those eccentricities that mark a particular genius. Arriving in Palermo, all our doubts have been disappointed. Falling in the company of Mr. FOSTER, the Archlect, a student of WYATTLES, who had travelled to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, about whom you are so worried, just Lord Byron; I met him on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited him in Mitylerie .\" We had never heard of the fame of his Lord Shlp, if we had been home for a few years; but \"Childe Harolde\" being put into our hands, we recognized the reclusion of Calcla on every page. Did we not regret that the riot was more serious in our research on the cottage, but we comforted our ideas with the idea of returning to Mitylone some future day; but to me that day I did not see again. I make this statement, believing that it is not entirely without intermence, and in court in the right name of its secretary, which was grossly gloomy. It has been disordered to bone an insensitive disposition, contrary to the asso-\ncalculating human nature, or contributing in any way to countering its sorrows, or adding to its pleasures. The fact is directly the inverse, as can accumulate politely from these small anecdotes. All the fine tho feelings of a rich heart, so elegantly represented in the poems of his secretary, seemed to have their seat in his bosoin. The tenderness, sympathy and charity seem to guide all his attention: arid his wrath, the reboso of solitude is an additional reason sore marking the hive as a sob on whose heart, religion has put its seal, attached on the head of which Benevolenoe has cast his mountain. No Korean idiot has read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a compatriot. As far as his love or pleasures are concerned, I do not imagine that he has the right to give an opinion. Replies must always be received with cautiori, especially when directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before this terrible court where he must appear, only can censor the errors of a confreremortol. Lord Byron's character is worthy of his genius. To do good in secret, and shuri that the applause of the world, if the surest testimony of a virtuous heart and self-adhesive consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Printer, Crown-cover, Flet-street.",
    "47": "A VAMPYRE:\nA Talc.\nBy Jahn Willlam Pollard.\nThe superstition on which this tale is founded is very general in the East. Among the Arabs, it seems to be common: it did not extend to the Greeks to untie the establishment of Christianity; and it has deafened only its present fortune since the division of the Latin and Greek churches; at that time, the increasingly widespread idea, that the Latin body could not corrugate if it was buried in their territory, it gradually collapsed, and abandoned the subject of many wonderful storios, still excavated, of the dead rising from their grass, and feeding on the blood of young and beautiful. In the Wost, it spread, with a slight variation, throughout Hungary, Poland, Austria and Lorcline, where there was a belief that vampyres soaked some of the blood of the victims, who became emaciated, lost the strength of the thorax, and died suddenly of consummations; these human blood suckers were fattening — and their veiris became distended to such a state of repulsion, so that they caused blood your flow of all passages of their body, and even pores of their skin.\nIn the March Journal of London ,19732, is a curious, and, from the cross, a credible account of a particular case of vampyrlsm, which was declared to have occurred in Madreyga, Hungary. It seems that, after an examination of the commander-in-chief and the magistrates of the square, they positively and unanimously affirmed, e at, about five years before, a certain Heydvke, ncliné Amold Poul, had been heard to say, thclt, Clt Cassavia, on the borders of the Turkish Service, he had been tormented by a vampy, but had found a way to get rid of himself of evil, eating part of the land over from the grave of the vampy, and rubbing himself bimbe with his blood. This precaution, however, did not prevent Bim himself from becoming a vampy; for about twenty or thirty days astray his death and burial, many people complained of being treated by him, and a statement was made, that four people had been deprived of life by his attacks. In order to avoid the furious malformations, the inhabltants having consulted their Hadagni, took the body, and found it (as it supposed to be usual in cases of vampyrism) fresh, and entirely free of corruption, and emitting in the mouth, nose, and avirons, pure and florid blood. As Praos was anointed, they resorted to the usual remedy. A slakk was led whole into Arnold Paul's heart and body, where he is reported to have shouted as terribly as if he had been alive. They cut off his head, burned his body, and threw ashes into his rubble. The same measures were adopted with the course of these people who had already died of vampyrism, and who, in turn, should become agents on others who survived the larn.\nTo the universal belief is that a person sucked by a vampyre becomes a vampyre himself, and shocks in turn.\nChief Bai....\nff.\nThis monstrous rodomontade is here relocated, because it seems better suited to illustrate the subject of current observations than any other instance that could be produced. In many parts of Greece, it is considered as a kind of punishment after death, for some odious cleric shared while he is in existence, that the deceased is not only doomed to vampyrise, but forced to confino his infernal visits only to beings that he loved most on earth, those to whom he was bound by ties of kinship and affection .— A punctuation alludes in the \"Giaour\".\nBut first upon the earth, as Vampyre hath sent him, thy horn shall be praised from his tom 6; then shall the shawl fall into the place of origin, and shall suck the blood of thy seed: from thence thy daughter, thy wife, by midnight, drain the stream of the life; yet hate the baricet that shall feed the living corse by liuid, thy victims, are yet come to pass, and shall know the devil for the sire: as thou cursest, thou cursest them, thy flaws are dried upon the stem. But he who mocked the crime, the youngest, the most beloved of AlI, will bless this word with the name of the teacher: This word will set your heart in flame! But you must put an end to your task and mark the last thing of his cheek — the last spark of his eye, and the last shiny ice must see Who freezes over his lifeless blue; Thori with the hand urihallowed will tear the braids of his yellow hair, from which, in life o lock white shorn. The bottom of the affection foot was wom — But now it is borrious far from your Memorial of thin agony! But with the lhinowri, the best hlood will flow; Your tooth of gnashlng, and the lip of haggard; Then tracking at your grave of sulten, Go—and with Gouls and Afrits rave, Until these iri horror shririk far from the spectro more cursed than they.\nMr. Southey also presented in his wild but hairy poem of \"Thclloba\", the vampy cross of the good Arab Oneiza, who is represented as having returned to the grave with the aim of tormenting him that she loved better during her life. But these are not plentiful to have resulted from the sinnoss of his life, it has been spilled throughout the o is the account of a fault of purity and innocence. The Vérocieux Tournefort makes a long account of the devouring journeys of amazing cases of vampyism, so that he claims that he was an eyewitness; and CaImet, in his great work on this subject, besides a variety of anecdotes, and traditional illicit accounts of his efforts, put forward some learned dissertations, tending to prove that it is a classical error, so barbaric bone.\nOne could add many crunches and interesting notes on this singularly horrible superstition; although the present may suffice for the limits of a riot, necessarily devolved to explanalion, which can now conclude by merely pointing out that although the term Vampyre is that in most general acceptance, there are several others synonymous with it, makes use of in different parts of the world: like Vraucoloeha, Vardoulacha, GouI, Broucoloka, &c.\nThe vampire.\nIt happened that, in the midst of the dissipations that accompanied a London writer, there appeared to the diversity of the qualities of the leaders of the ton a noble, more remarkable for its singularities, than its rank. He looked at the mirror around him, as if he could not participate. Apparently, the light larb of the sair attracted only his attention, that he would stare at him, and cast fear into those fucking breasts reigned careless. Those who felt this sensation of fear could not explain from where it arose: some attributed it to the eye gray deod, which, staring on the face of the object, did not seem to penetrate, and at a glance your pierce through the interior works of the heort; hut fell on the cheek with a reed of lead weighed on the skin that he could not pass. His peculioritios invited him into all the houses; all wanted the seo, and those who had been accused of violence oxcitemeritis, and now felt the power of boredom, were happy to have something in their presence capable of engaging the attention of the thalers. Despite the deadly tint of her face, which never won a warmer draw, either from the blush of modesty, or a strong emotion of pass ion, although its shape and contours were beautiful, many female hunters after notori ety tried to gain his attention, and again, aside, some marks of what they cursed the term of affection: Lady Mercer, who badbe lbe mocked every monster worn in the drawing rooms since her marriage, threw himself in her way, and put everything except on the robe of a Montagnard bank, to attract her notioe :— although in uan :— when she stood at him, although her eyes apparently fixed on her, still it seemed that they were unperceived ;— even her inapprehensive impvdence was flouted, and she licked the field. But even if the adultery commune never affected the Guidanco of his eyes, it was not that the female sex was invited to him: but such was the apparent situation with which that he spoke to the virtuous woman and innocent girl, whom few ever knew strange hc glusergic aux femmes. Ho had, ancestor, the reputation of a winning language; and if it was tall, he even overcame the fear of his singular character, or that this theory was moved by his apparent hatred of the apparatus, he was also often among the other female women who boast of their sex erode their domestic virtues, as I am those who push her by their vices.\nAt about the same time, a young man named Aubrey came to London: he was an orphan left with a small sister in possession of hail, by parents who died while he was still in childhood. Lefl also hesels by the guardians, who have thought the more simple duty to take care of his fortune, while they have taken into account the greater shade of his mind in the custody of the meroenary subalterns, he cultivated his imagination more than his judgment. He had, moreover, this high romantic feeling of honor and frankness, flouting every day, so many apprentice militiamen. He all wanted to sympathize with virtue, and thought that the vice that was thrown by Providence simply for the picturesque effect of the scene, cls that we see in romances: he thought that the inserie of a cottage was simply consisting of the jacket of clothes, which were so warm, but that were better suited to the eye of the painter by the irregular folds Jr and var. He thought, in the end, that the poets' dreams were the regalities of the life. It is beautiful, frank and rich: for other reasons, on the gay circles around it, many mothers surround it, trying to describe the least truth, their languishing or snoring favourites: the girls at the same time, by their brilliant faces that he approached, and by their sparkling eyes, when he opened his lips, soan led him in false nolons of his talents and his merit. Attached as he was to the romance of his solitary hares, it started to find that, except in the candles of tallow and wax that sparkle, not from the presence of a ghosl, but from the scent of snuffing, there was no foundation in the real life for any thal congreries of pleosing images and descriptions containing iri these volumes, from which he had formed his study. However, by finding some compensation in his gratified family, he was about torelinquish his dreams, when the extraordinary being we described above, met him in his career.\nHe looked at him, and the very impossibility of forming an idea of the character of a man entirely absorbed in himself, which gave a few other signs of his observation of external objects, than the tacit assemblage to their existence, implicit by the avoidance of their contact: allowing hls imagination to paint all that flattered them prapensity your extruding ideas, he soon formed this object to the hero of a romance, and determined to obscure the progeny of his fantasy, rather than the person in front of him. He met him, paid attention to him, and so far, in his opinion, his preference has always been recognized. Little by little, he realized that Lord Ruthvens fairs were embarrassed, and soon found, seized the nats of preparation in — Street, that he was about to travel. Desirous of obtaining information somo responding to this singular character, which, still now, had only sharpened its curiosity, he suggested that if the guards, it was time for him to by from the tour, that it was deemed necessary for many generations to allow young people to take a few quick steps in the care of the vice to put themselves at the top of equality with the elderly, and not to let them appear as if fallen from the shoes, whenever scandalous intrigues are mentioned as topics of plea or praise, harmonising the degree of skill they have had to wear. They consented: and Aubrey immediately murmured his intentions to Lord Ruthven, was surprised to receive from him a proposal to join Bim. Flattened by Sueh, a lack of esteem for him, who, apparently, had nothing in a woman with other men, he readily accepted it, and iri a few days they had spent the circular wings.\nHilherta, Aubrey bad had no opportunity to study the character of Lord Rulhven, and now he found that, though much more of his actions were exposed to his studies, the results offered different color inclusions of the apparent pattern to his conduct. His companion was profuse in his literature ;— the lazy, the vagrant, and the beggar, received from his hand more than enough to relieve their immediate needs. But Aubrey could not avoid noticing that it was not insurmountable, the virtuous, reduced to indignation by the misfortunes of companion, even on uirtuc, that he had bestowed his alarms ;— these were sent out of the door barely sneezed; but when the profligate came to ask for something, not to relieve his desires, but to allow him to harden himself in his lust, to sink even deeper into his iniquity, he was flanked by rich charity. However, this was attributed by him to the greater import of the vicious, generally p revail on the hastily removed from the virtuous needy. There were more circumstances about the charity of his Lordship, which was more impressed on the mind: all those on whom it was granted, inevitably found that there was our on just, for all the either were led to the scafsold, or sunk at the lowest and most abject necessary. In Brussels and in other cities through the whip, they passed, Aubrey was surprised at the appearance of the greedy with whom the companion bis sought the centres of all the vices in fashion; there he entered into the whole spirit of the Faro table: he bet, and played always successfully, except where the strongest known was his antagonist, and then he lost the same mare as hc won; but it was always with the same unshakeable face, with which he usually swept society around: it was not, rainbow, so when he encountered the novice eruption of yourself, or the father without chance of a Numcroise family; their desire story seemed the law of petune — this apprehensive obstinacy of the spirit was set aside, and his eyes shone with more fire than that of the cat crying with the balm mouse. In every city, he left the old easy youth, torn from the circle which he adorned, bent, in the solitude of a dungeon, the fate that had drawn him to the reach of this friend; while many of a fat man sat frantically, in the midst of the airs speaking silent hungry children, without a song, far from his last immense wealth, where with even busy sufficient to satisfy their present desire. However, he did not take from the game table of Tbe; but immediately lost, to the ruiner of me any, the last dorlot that he had just pulled from the convulsive catch of the innocent: it could but be the result of a certain degree of knowledge, which was not, however, able to fill the vigning of the most experienced. Aubrey often wanted to represent him to his friend, begged him to resign from charity and charity that proved the destruction of the doll, and did not tend to his own profit ;— but be delayed — every day he hoped that his friend would be speaking to him openly and openly; however, this never happened. The Lord Ruthven in his car, and arming the wild and rich uarlous scenes of nature, was always the same: his eye dunged less than his lip; and although Aubrey was near him object of his curiosity, he did not obtain more gratification of it than the canonist excitement of wanting vainly to break this mystery, which his exalted imagination began to assume the appearance of some supernatural thing.\nThey soon arrived at Rome, and Aubrey for a lime lost sight of his companion; he left him in the daily attendance in the morning circle of an Italian country, while he went in search of the memories of another almost deserted city. As he was so engaged, letters came from England, which opened impatiently.\nthe first came from his sister, breathing out riots but affection; the others came from his guardians, and the latter surprised him; if he had before enlisted in his enrollment that there was evil power releasing in his companion, they seemed to give him a background sufficient for the bellef. His guards insisted on his impreviable leaving his friend, and urgcd, that his character was terribly vicious, so that the possession of bones jrresistible power of seduction, made his licentious hahits more dangerous to silky. It was found wrong, that his contempt for the adulatrice had rioted in the hatred of the chclracter bor; but that he had demanded, for chance, hjs gratification, that his vlctlm, the partner of his gull, scrambled he threw the pinnacle of the non-sullic virtue, up to the lowest abyss of the infclmy and degradation: in the end, that all the formulas he had sought, apparently because of their virtue, had, since the beginning bis, even thrown the mask, and had not burned to expose all the deformity of their vices to the public gaze.\nAubrey determined by leaving one, whose child character has not yet shown a single bright point on which to rest the eye. He solved the invent a pretext of plausible abandoning him from far alterthcr, purposing, long time then mean, to whip him closer, and not to let pass any slight circumstances. He entered the same circle, and soon perpetuated, that his Lordship endeavoured to work on the inexperience of the daughter of the lady's house which he mainly frequented. In Italy, it is sold that a married woman is met in the priesthood; so he was obliged to pursue his plans in secret; the eye of bulbrey followed him in all his fringes, and soon realized that a wrong assignment was effective, which would probably end up ruining an innocent girl, though without thought. Not wasting any time, he set up a LordRuthvens apartment, and asked him abruply for his intentions towards the lady, informing her to the lime that he was aware of his being meeting her that night. Lord Ruthven anesthetized that his intentions were such class, he thought that all could have had such an opportunity; and after having been pressed if he intended to marry him, simply ugly. The Aubrey retired.\nHe ordered his servant to look for other apartments, and called the lady's mother, informed him of all that he cried, not only with regard to his daughter, but also concerning the character of his Lordship. The subpoena has been notified. The next day, Lord Ruthven rejoiced at not giving full consent to a separation, but he did not suspect that his plans had been thwarted by Aubreys interposition.\nHaving left Rome, Aubrey headed for Greece and crossed the Peninsula, and soon found himself in Athens. He fixed his residence in the house of a Greek; and the son took care to take hold of the faded traces of an anesthetic glory over the monumerites apparently, ashamed to tell the acts of the free men before the slaves, had hidden under the sheltering ground or many lichens. Under the same roof as him, there existed a beautiful and delicate being that she could have formed the model for a painter wanting to pour on canvass the promised hope of falsehood in the Mohammed period, except that her eyes spoke too much spirit for someone to think that she should belong to those who had no souls. As she danced on the plain, or stumbled on the side of the mountain, it was said that gazelle babe was a bad type of her beauties; for who would have exchanged his eye, apparently the eye of the animated nature, for this luxurious look drowsy of the adapted symbol, but of the heap of an epic. The light stage of the anthem often accommodates.\nNied Aubrey in his search for antiquilics, and often would be the unconscious girl, engaged in the pursuit of a kashmere butterfly, showed all the beauty of his farm, floating as it carried on the wind, greedy gaze of him, who forgot the letters that he had just deciphered an almost erasable tablet, in contemplation of the figure of her sylph. Often, her falling braids, as she flattered around, exhibited in the ray of the sun so delicately bright and quickly engaged the hves, he simmered well the oblivion of the antiquarian, which let escape from his mind blue vory object that he had before being of vital importance for the correct interpretation of a passage in Pausanias. But why try to describe the charms that everyone feels, but no one can appreciate ?— It was innocent, youthful and majesty, without being affected by crowded drawing rooms and suffocating balls. To the extent that he drew the remains of which he wanted to keep a miracle for his future hours, she stood up, arid looking at the magical effects of her pencil, tracing the scenes of her native; she could then destabilize the dance encircled on the open plain, painted to her, in all the brilliant colors of youthful memary, the pamp of marriage that she remembered having seen in her childhood; and then, turning objects that had obviously made a greater impression on her mind, would tell her all the supernatural tales of her nurse. Her fervour and her apparent belief in what she was telling, aroused often as she told her the story of the living vampy, which had spent years among her friends, and the most dear ties, forced each year, by feeding on the life of a beautiful female to prolong her existence once after the following months, her blood was running cold, while he tried to laugh at her by such fanlasms and horrible fantasies; but Iantbe took away the names of old men, who had at last detected a living being among them, after several of their close to parents were found badly marked with the tame of the friend's appetite; and when she found him so unbelievable, she begged him to believe her, for he was bad, noticed that those who had dared to doubt their existence, always had a proof of givon, which forced them, with sorrow and tear, to confess this was true. She detailed him the traditional appearance of these monsters, and her harrors multiplied, hearing a fairly precise description of Lord Rulhven; however, he persisted on persuading her, that there could be no truth in the fears hor, though at the time when he wondered about the many cornercjderics that all tended to excile a belief in Lord Ruthven's fupernatural power.\nAubrey began to cling more and more to Ianthe; his innocence, so contrasted with all the virtues affected the womeri among whom he had sought for his vision of love, won his hell; and while he ridiculed the idea of a wig man of English habits, marrying a Greek without instruction, still found him more and a bit attached to the almost fajry sorm before him. He at times torn himself from her, and, forming a plan for some antiquary research, he left, dissuaded not to return until her object was reached; but he always found it impossible to fix his attention on the ruins around him, while in his mind he retained an image that saw only the legitimate possessor of his thoughts. Ianthe was unconscious of his love, and was always the same welcome of frank children he had known for the first time. Sbe could seem to separate from him with reluctance; but it was the use of boca fhe had no loring with which she could visit her favorite haunts, but her guardian was busy sketching or discovering hiding some fragment that had yet escaped the destructive hand of time. She had appealed to her parents on the subject of vampires, and they both, with several present, affirmed their existence, pale with even dwarf horror. Shortly afterwards, Aubrey decided to continue his excursions, which had to hold him for a few hours; when they heard the name of the place, he begged him all at once not to return at night, because he necessarily had to spend the through a wood, where no Greek remained, after the closing of the day, on any consideration whatsoever. They described it as the resort of the vampires in their night orgies, and denounced the heaviest evils as the imminent person who dared to search their way. Aubrey made the light of their representations, and tried to devour them from the idea; but when he saw them trembling at his audacity to mock in this way, a superior, infernal power, whose very name apparently made their blood shaken, he silenced himself.\nThe next morning, Aubrey set out on his uncluttered excursion; he was surprised to absorb the melancholy face of his soul, and was appalled that his words, mocking the belief of these horrible fools, had inspired them with such a terror. When he was lowered to leave, Ianthe came to the lc slope of his horse, and bitterly begged Oshim to come back, the night was allowed to the power of these beings to put in action ;— which promised. He was, however, so busy with his research, that he did not see that the daylight was about to end, and that on the horizon there was one of those spots which, in the warmer climates, so quickly, the higher inlo a tremendous mass, and poured out all the rabies of stuttering on the devious country .— He, however, finally climbed his horse, determined to catch up with the asphalt for his delay: but he was too late. The twilight, in the climates of the south, is the most unknown; immediately the sun sets, the night that begins: and the ore who had advanced far, the power of the storm was clbovo—they echoing tbunders had barely a resting inlerval—lts thick brittle rain forced his way through the foliage of the canopy, while the forked blue lightning seemed to fail and radiate to his feet itself. Suddenly, his horse was afraid, and he was transported with a terrible speed through the tangled forest. Finally, the animal, through the faligue, stopped, and found, by the glare of lightning, that he was in the vicinity of a hoof that hardly lifted himself from the masses of dead leaves and brufhwood that overwhelmed him. Demonstrating, he approached, hoping to find someone to guide him to the city, or at least to have confidence to get a shelter from the coat of the storm. As he objected, the thunders, for a silent moment, moved him away from hearing the draconian cries of a woman who mingled with suffocation, exulted with a laugh, continued in oria almost uribroken sound ;— he began to awaken; but, agitated by the thunder that was rolling again on his head, he, with a sudden effort, forced the door of the hut to be opened. He found himself in total darkness: the sound, the screaming, guided him. He did not understand, although he had set down, the sounds continued, and nothing was made of him. He found him in contact with someone who seized himself immediately; and a voice cried out ,\"Again gagged!\" to whom a great laugh succeeded; and he felt overwhelmed by him who seemed superhuman: determined to sow life as dearly as he could, he read; but it was vain: he was lifted up from the buffalo and threw a great deal of force against the ground :— his enemy threw himself up, and knelt in his chest, had put his hands on his throclt—wherei the dazzling of many torches penetrating into the hole that gave light in the day, disturbed him ;— he rose up unshakeably, and, throwing his prey, rushed into the door, and for a moment the crclshing of the branches, as he broke through the wood, was not heard. The storm was not still; and Aubrey, unable to move, was soor heard by those who did not. They entered, the light of their torches fell on the mud walls, and the tank took care of each straw with heavy soft flakes. At Aubreys desire, they made sure for the one who had attracted him to his thunderstorms; he left himself again in the darkness; but what was his horror, when the light of the torthcs burst again upon him, to perceive the aerial form of his beautiful conductress brought iri a course without life. He closed his eyes, hoping that it was only a vision arising from his dislocated imagination; but he again saw the same form, when he unlocked them, stretchod by his fide. There was no colour on his cheek, not even on his lip; but there was a silence on the face of the cheek who seemed almost as attached as the life that once lived there :— on his neck and chest was blood, and on his throat were the marks of teeth having opened the vein :— to this man pointed, shouted, simultaneously struck with horror ,\" A Vampyre! A vampire !\" A litter was quickly formed, and Aubrey was laid beside the hor, which had recently been the object of so many brilliant and fetish visions, now fallen with the flower of life that had died the witch. He did not know what he thought — his mind was inflamed and was aware of his reflection, and took refuge in the vacancy — he held almost unconsciously in his hand, a bare dagger of a particular correction, which was poorly found in the hut. The various parties that had engaged in the area of the woman here, a mother had missed, met soon. Their lamentable crying, after they approached the city, warned the parents of a lucid catastrophe. \" To describe their sorrows would be impossible; but when they ascerated the cause of their child's death, they looked at Aubrey, a wave pointed towards Corsica. They were inconsolable; both died in a broken heart.\nAubrey being put to bed was seized with the most violent fever, and was often delicious; in these intorvals he would appeal to Lord Ruthven and Ianthe—by healthy inaccourable combination who seemed to be begging his former companion to spare the being he loved. At other times, he permeated the sick on his head, and cursed him as his destroyer. Lord Ruthven, had the opportunity at that time to arrive in Athens, and, from some native, hearing the state of Aubrey, immediately placed himself in the same hoof, and became his constant companion. The latter recovered from the delirium bis, he was horrified and began to see the one whose image he now had combined with that of O Vampyre; but Lord Ruthven, by his kind words, almost repented for the fault that had caused their separation, and still more by attention, anxiety, and care that he showed, soon reconciled them to the presence bis. His seigneury seemed completely changed; he no longer appeared as an apathetic being who had marveled so much Aubrey; but as soon as his brain convalescence was rapid, he gradually withdrew into the same state of mind, and Aubrey did not perceive any difference from the old mon, except that sometimes he was surprised to grind his gaze fixed upon him, with a smile of malicious exultation playing on his lips: he did not know why, but this smile haunted him. During the final stage of the healing of the invalid, Lord Steven was apparently engaged in monitoring the tideless waves raised by the cold breeze, or in the interference of the progress of these words, turning, like our world, the still sun ;— in fact, he seemed to want to avoid the eyes of all.\nAubreys spirit, by this shock, was weakening, and this elasticity of the spirit that had so distinguished him now seems to have become blunt forever. He was now as in love with solitude and silence as Lord Ruthven; but as long as he wanted solitude, his mind could not find him in the neighborhood of Athens; if he sought him in the midst of the ruins, he had once frequented, the shape of Ianthe stood by the hift side – if he saw him in the woods, his light step seems to be woride in the middle of the undergrowth, in spite of the modest violet; then suddenly blushing, would show, to his wild imagination, pale face and wounded throat, with a soft smile on his lips. He was determined to make beautiful scenes, all the seams of which created bitter assemblations in the mind. He proposed to Lord Ruthven, to whom he had stood by the tendor that he had taken care of him during his illness, that they should visit these parts of Greece and had not yet seen. They went in all directions, and searched for all the places to which a memory should be attached; but although they had thus taken their place, they seemed to ignore what they were looking at. They heard many robbers, but they gradually began to blur these relationships, which they imagined only the invention of individuals, whose interest was to arouse the generosity of those that they had removed from supposed dangers. Consequently, by neglecting the advice of the inhabitants, they traveled once with only a few guides, more to serve as a train guide as a defense. When entering, archever, a small narrow deflate, at the bottom of which wclrge of rock descended from the neighboring precipices, they had reclsori ta repente la negligence; for almost the whole party engaged iri the narrow pass, when they were slartled by the beating of bullets near their head, and by echoes the report of several cannons. In an instant, their words had left them, and, playing behind the rocks, had started the fire in the direction from which the part came. Lord Ruthven arid Aubrey, initiating their example, retired for a moment behind the glimmer of faith; but shameful to be so distracted by an enemy, who with insulting should have they advanced, and to be exposed to non-res-\nIf the thieves rushed up and took them to the rear, they would once delegate themselves to the enemy, in fear of the enemy. He had barely lost the shelving of the rock, when Lord Rutbven received a bullet in his shoulder, which led him to the ground. Aubrey hastened to help him; and, no longer taking into account the help or his own peril, one soon surprised by seeing the faces of the robbers around him — his guards having, on the fact that Lord Ruthven was dumped, impenetibly cast their arms and handed over.\nBy the promise of a great reward, Avbrey soon pushed them to transport his wounded fried to a nearby hut; and having accepted vpon a ransom, he was more disturbed by their presence — they are only to keep the entrance until their currency returns with the promised sum, for which he had an order. The strength of Lord Ruthuen was rapidly lost; two days of mortifical rain followed, and death seemed to progress rapidly. His conduct and appearance had not changed; he seemed as unconscious of the pain as he had been the object of it; but towards the end of the last evening, his mind apparently became vneasy, and his icec often fixed on Aubrey, which was induced to offer the assistance bis more than the ordinary atrium —\" Help me! You save me – you can do more that – I don't mean my life. I listened to the death of my existence once as little as tot of the past day; but you can save my honor, the honor of your brother. \"-\" How? What do you mean? I would do anything ,\" Aubrey said. \"I need, but a little, of my best peace life, I can explain everyone, but if you hide everything you know about me, my honor was free to stain in the mouth of the world, and if only Doath was unknown for the time of somo in England, I — but life. \"—\"He will not be known. \"Swear !\" cried the dying man, waking up from an exultant violence :\"Swear that your whole soul, through all nature fear, resents the scar that, for one year a day, you will not give your knowledge of my crimes or death to a living being in any way, whatever happens, or whatever you can see. His eyes seemed to burst out of their bases :\" I swear !\" said Harry, he made fun of his pill and stopped breathing.\nAubrey withdrew to rest, but did not go away; the many circumstances waiting for him acquaintonco with this man rose up on his mind, and he knew why nat; when he resumed his oath, a cold calvary came upon him, as if of the presence of something horrible awaiting him. When a thief met him, he informed him that he was no longer there, that he had been transmitted by his arid comrades, at his retirement, to the top of a nearby mountain, according to a promise he had made to bis Lordship, that he should be exposed to his first cold ray of the moon rising at the back of his death. Aubrey astonished, and taking several three men, determined to go and bury just on the place where he was. But, which he had molested at the top, he found no trace of either the corpse or clothes, although the rabbis swore that they had reported the same rock on which they had laid the body. For some time, his mind was bewildered by conjugations, but he finally swollen again, convinced that they had buried the corpse for the sake of clothing.\nWeary of a country in which we had met with such terrible misfortunes, and iri that all apparently conspired for hoighten that superstitious shot melancholy had grasped on his mind, he realized to leave him, we soon arrived at Smyrncl. While waiting for a ship to compete with him in Otranto or Naples, he took care to arrange the effects that he had in a bad mood, belonging to Lord Ruthven. This was a case involving criminal, major or less appropriate secret weapons to ensure the death of the victim.\nIm. There were several daggers and taoghans. While turning them around, and looking at their curious forms, what was his surprise at finding a sheath apparently adorned in the same style as the dagger discovered in the fatal hut — he trembled — hastcning to get more evidence, he sounds a weapon, and his horror can be imagined when he discovered that he adjusted, although particularly chapcd, the sheath he held in his hand. His eyes sowed you do not need further certainty — they seemed to look at the being bound to the dagger; but still hc did not want to believe; but the particular shape, the same variable shades on the tooth and sheath were like in the splendor on both, and did not leave from to doubt; there were also drops of blood on each.\nHe left Smyrna, and on the way back from this, in Rome, his first incursions were correcting the lady whom he had attempted to snatch the detective arts of Lord Ruthven. His inclinations are in distress, their fate is ruined, and it has not been heard since the departure of the secretary's body. Aubrey's spirit became almost broken under so many repeated horrors; he was afraid that this lady had fallen a victim to the destroyer of the nation. He became morose and silent; and his only occupation was to exhort the speed of the positions, as if he were going to save the life of someone whom he had made. He came to Calais; a bridge, who seemed obedient to his will, soon tied him on the English coasts; and he hastened in the house of his fathers, and, for a moment, he appeared to lose, iri, the embraces and caresses of his siphon, all the memory of the past. If she before, by her infantile caresses, won her affection badly, now that the begari woman to appear, she was even more attached to the comparison.\nMiss Aubrey had not won the grace that won the game and the applause of the salon assemblage. There was none of this light shine that exists only in the reading atmosphere of a crowded apartment. His blue eye was never illuminated by the levity of the mind below. There was a melancholy choir on this subject which seemed not to be born of an evil, but of a feeling inside, which seemed to indignant a conlictuous soul of a brighter kingdom. His step was not so light, wandering where a butterfly or a color can hang—jl was sedate, arid perishive. When alone, his Facio was never illuminated by the smile of joy; bull when her brother breathed her affection, arid in his presence would forget these graphics. She knew that he had destroyed his rest, who could have exchanged his smile for the voluptuous one? It seemed that these eyes ,— that space was then played in the light of their ancestral native sphere. She was only eighteen years old, and had not been introduced to the world. It had been thought by her guardian that her presentation should be delayed until her brother moved away from the continent, when he could be her protector. It was therefore now that it was resolved that the next salon, which opens quickly, should be the topic of its entry into the \"abuse scene\". Aubrey would have preferred to remain in the meaning of his fathers, and fed on the melanoboli that had defeated him. He does not feel interested in the frivolities of fashion strangers, when his evil spirit was so torn by the students that he had witnessed; but be prevented from sacrificing his own consolation to the protection of the chief sister. They soon came into the town, and prepared for the next day, which had been arranged as a living room.\nThe crowd was excessive — a child salon was not held for a long time, and the call was eager to rest in the kingship smile, bastened either. Aubrey was there with her sister. While he was stretching himself in a corner by himself, without anything around him, engaged in the memory that the first time he had seen Lord Ruthven was in this very place — suddenly feeling beset by the tho arm, and cl voice which recognized too well, sounded in his ear —\"Remember your oath .\" He did not have much to do, fearing seeing a spectre that blaslbirn, that he received, a little distano, the same figure that had drawn his attention to this place upon the first entry into society. He looked until his members almost refused to wear their weight, he was forced to take the claw of a friend, and forcing a passage through the crowd, he threw himself in a junk car, and was taken home. He clung to the room with huge raised steps, and fixed his hands on his head, as if he feared that his thoughts would burst out of his brain. Lord Ruthven again before him — circumstances began iri terrible picture — the dclgger — his oath .— He woke up, he could not believe that it was possible — death rises again !— He had his imagination conveyed vp the image on which his mind is resounding. It was impossible for just to be real — so he did, again, go in society; for although he tried to ask about Lord Ruthven, the name hung on his lips, and he failed to get the information. He left a few nights later with his sister to try the assembly of a senior relationship. Leaving his wife the work of a matron, he withdrew to a corner, and there he did his own devouring blows. Perceived, to last, mony was leaving, he shook himself, entering another room, found his sister surrouled by several, apporting seriously conversation; he tried to pass lo arid approach her, when the one, whom he asked to move, turned, and revealed to him in these traits he most borrowed. And he went to his sister's arm, and in haste he went to the street; and at the door he began to take hold of the host of the servants who were waiting for their lords; and while he was rabid to pass them, he heard the voice that came near to him :«Remember your oath !”\nThe Aubrey became distracted almost. So before his mind was absorbed by a sub-joct, how many more completely was absorbed, now than the territory of the monster's life once again pressed on his thoughts. Her sister's attention was now nheeded, and it was in vain that she inlreated hiinto explain to her which had caused bis conduct abruptly. He spoke only a few words, and terrified him. The more he thought, the more perplexed he was. His goal began it ;— was he then to allow this monster to wander, run over his breath, in the midst of a dear one, and did not have his progress? This very sister might be atched by him. But even if he broke his path, and closed his superiors, who would believe it? He thought he was using his own hand to free the world from such a misery; but well, he remembered, had already been mocked. For days, he remained this state; murmured his room, he saw no one, and ate only when his cane sister, who, with eyes flowing with tears, begged him, for his good, to support the culture. Finally, being no longer able to endure calm and loneliness, he left his house, wandered from the street to street, anxious to steal this image that invaded him. His dress ruined, and he wandered, as often exposed to your thick non-day suri as to the humidity of the middle neighborhood. He was no longer recognized; he first read with the evening at home; but finally he deposited it for relief wherever fatigue took him. His sister, anxious for his safety, employed people also to follow him; but they were soon removed by him who was running away from a pursuer faster than any thought. His brain, however, suddenly changed. Struggled by the idea that by his absence, he left all his friends, with a friend among them, whose presence they were unconscious, he decided to engage again in society, and looked at him closely, anxious in advance, despite his oath, that the Lord Rulhuen was intimately ostracized. But when he entered a room, his burger and his crackling looks were so striking, his interior trembled so visible, that his sister was finally begged to refrain from seeking, for her, the society that infected him so strongly. However, when the demonstration proved to be unshakeable, the guards thought it was good to intervene and, fearing that his friend would be alienated, they thought it was a high time to take over against trot trust, who had already imposed upon by Aubreys parents.\nIn order to save him from the wounds and suffering, he had encountered daily in his wanderings, and to prevent him from exposing to the general eye, these marks of what they considered to be madness, they hired a physician to reside in the house of Tbe, and to constantly take care of Hiin. He hardly seemed to notice it, so completely his mind was absorbed by a terrible subject. His incoherence finally became so great that he was confined to his hamber. That was where he was often fine for days, unable to pass out. He had been emaciated by the bee, his eycians had reached a glazed chandelier ;— even if only a sign of effect and memory which dissipated at the entrance of the sister's hand, then he began sometimes, and, grabbing hordes hands, with eyes that were grievous to him, he desired that she should not punish him. \"Oh, don't touch Bim, if your love for me is great, don't come near him !\" When, however, she asked whom he was speaking to her, the only answer was :\"True! Travel !\" And again, it rings in a state, from which it could not even roam them. It lasted many months: however, gradually, as the year passed, its inconsistencies became less frequent, and his mind threw a part of his morosity, while his guardians observed that the secular times in the day he counted on his fingers, a dofinite number, then smile.\nThe time had almost passed, when, on the last day of the year, once of his tutor entering his room, began to corvette with the doctor upon the melancholy circumstance of Aubreys being in such a clumsy situation, when his sister went the next day to get married. Aubrey's attention was immediately drawn; he asked with an anxiety whom. Happy with this indelective return mark, while they feared that he had been deprived, they mentioned the dream of the Count of Marsden. He was a young Earlwom with whom he had met in society. A ubrey seemed happy, and assumed them stronger by expressing his intention to be present at the hospital, and eager to see his sister. They didn't answer, but in a few minutes his sister was with him. He was apparently again able to be affected by the influence of his pretty smile; for being pressed to breech, and kissing his cheek, wet with leeches, flowing to the thought of his brother being once again alive to feelings of affection. He began to talk with all his wonderd warinth, and to congloute her on his marriage with a person so disconcerted for rank and every accomplishment; when hc suddenly perceived a medallion on beer breast; open it, what was his surprise to see the features of the monster who had so long influenced his life. Hc see a portrait in a paroxysm of rabies, and pietina under the foot. On her asking him why he thus destroyed the resemblance of his future husband, he looked as if he had understood it riot—then grab his hands, and look at her with a frantic expression of Countnarico, he told her to swear that she would never marry this morister, for he—but he did not covet the advance — it seemed that this voice bale remembered his oath—he turned with dismay, thinking that Lord Ruthveri was near him but saw no one. In the same sense, the guards and the doctor, who had heard everything, and thought that this misfortune was only a return to his trouble, entered, and the force of Miss Aubrey, discouraged him from leaving him. He fell upon his brothers to them, implored, he begged to delay, but for one day. They attributed this to the folly they imagined, took possession of his spirit, tried to pacify him, and withdrew.\nLord Ruthvon had called to the morning after the drawroom, and had been refused with each else. When he heard of Aubreys ill health, he easily understood it; but when he learned that he was considered crazy, his exultation and pleasure could hardly be concealed from those among whom he had won this information. He relied on the use of his former companion, and, by constant attendance, and the claim of great affection for the most inlerant brother iri bis destiny, he graduated only won the ear of Miss Aubrey. Who could resist his power? Hlstongue had dangers and toils to tell—could speak of himself as an individual having no sympathy with ony being on the crowded earth, except with her to whom to address himself;—could say how, sinco being known, bis existence, had looked worthy of preservation, if it were not shot he could listen to his soothing accents ;—iri fine, hc knew so well how to use the art of the serponl, or such was the will of the fal, that he gained his affections. He obtained an important embassy, which was used as an excuse for having hastened the marriage (in spite of his brother's disturbed state) which was to place Tako on the very day of his departure for the continent.\nAubrey, when he was left by the doctor and his guardians, tried to bribe the servants, but in vain. He asked for a pen and a poper; it was given to him; he wrote a letter to the sister of hls, conjvrant, os she appreciated her own happiness, her own honor, and the honor of lhose now in the grave, wbo once being she in the arms of her as their hope and the hope of their home, to delay but for a few hours this marriage, on which he denounced the heaviest curses. The drafts promised that they would unlock it; but by giving it to the doctor, he thought it would be better not to harass Miss Aubrey's mind further by, what he considered, the raviars of a maniac. The night spent with the rest of the occupied prisoners of the house; and Aubrey heard, with a dread of horror can more easily be conceived as described, the notes of busy preparatiori. Marning has come, and the sound of the tiles is broken on his ear. Aubrey grew almost frantic. The curiosity of the servants at least overcame vigilance, they ruined it, leaving it in the custody of a defenseless woman old. He seized the opportunity, with a bond, was out of the room, and in a moment was found in the apartment where all was almost assembled. The Lord Ruthven was the first to perceive him: he approached immediately, and, taking his arm by force, shouted him out of the room, without ardour. On the stairs, Lord Ruthven murmured in his row :\" Remember your oath, and know, if it is not my fiancee by the day, that your sister is dishonored. Women are fragile !\" So, he said, he pushed him to the assistants, who, wrinkled by the old woman, came to pick him up. Aubrey could no longer stand himself; his rage found no vent, had broken a discharge vessel, and he was carried to bed. This was not mentioned to his sister, who was not present when he entered, as the doctor was afraid to shake him. The marriage was solemnized, and the bride and the husband left Loridon.\nAubrey weakness, iricreasod; blood tho cfuslon produced symptams close to the depth approach. He wanted the guardians of his siscrat to be called, and when the midnight over had passed out, he would tell in a composite way what the reader could pursue, he died immediately after.\nThe guards rushed to protect Miss Aubrey; but when they stopped, it was too lonely. Lord Ruthven had disappeared, and Aubreys sister had slipped the thirst for a VAMPYRE!\nEXTRACT FROM A LETTER CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE BYRON ORDER IN MITYLENE ISLAND.\nACCOUNT OF THE RESIDENCE OF THE LORD, BYRON, etc.\n\"The world was in front of him, where to choose his place of rest, would provide his guidance .\"\nIn Sajling through the Greek Archipelago, on board one of the ships of the majesty bis, in the year 1812, we pull into the port of Mitylene, on the lhc island of the name of that. The interest of this place, and the supply of certain cattle and vegetables still have there, in advance mary Brihlsh vossel to visit it, both men of war and merchant; and although it is instead on the way for the ships holding that Smyrna, its premiums reimburse amply for the deviation of a voyage. We usually landed at the bottom of the bay, and the men began to work at the grubbing-up, and the handbag for the cattle of the natives, the ecclesiastical and myself to the cave called Hamer's school, and other places where we were before. On the front of Mount Ida (a small mound so named) we met and hired a young Greek class our guide, who told us that he had come to Scio with a Lord Erigle, who left Tbe Island four days before our arrival in his Felucca. \"He hired me as a pilot ,\" said the Greek ,\" and he would have lacquered me with him; but I did not have the chaos to leave Mitylene, where I am likely to get married. He was a weird man, but very good. He left him an old man in charge: he gave Dominic, the winemaker, six hundred zechins for him ,( about L 250 degrees English ,) and resided here about fourteen months, but not constantly; for he sails very often in his foluca towards the various islands .\"\nThis story exalted our curiosity, and we did not have time to hasten in the house where our compatriot had settled. We were graciously received by a man of God, who colocated us on the mansion. It consists of four apartments on the ground floor: an entrance hall, a living room, a sitting room, and a bedroom, with an attached spacious closet. They all have fine decor: green waltzes, a marl table on each side, a large myrtle in the centre, and a small fountain below, which could bc mclde to play the bronchi by moving a source fixed on the side of a small bronze Venus in a tilting cl posture; a large euch or sofcl completes the smoke. In the room, there were half a dozen English cane chairs, and an empty library: there were no mirrors, or a single painting. The bedohamber is only a large mattress lying on the floor, with two stuffed cotton mattresses and a pillow, the common bed throughout Greece. We were obsessed with a rebose of marble, formerly, the old renan told us, dragged by books of paper, who were then in a great sailor. Those in the closet: it was open, but we did not think we could justify ourselves by examining the content. On the recof tablet, the works of Voltoire, Shakespeare, Boileau, Rousseau are complete; the Ruins of the Empires of Volney; Zimrnerman, in the language of Gcrman Languclge; the Messiah of Klopstock; the novels of Katzebue; the play of Sehiller of Robberf; the Parodise Lost of Milton, an Italian edition, printed in Pclrma in 181 O; several small brochures from the Greek press in Constantinople, much torn, but rio English book of any description. Most of these books are filled with marginal notes, written with a pencil, in Italian Latin one. Mossia was literally scribbled everywhere, and marked with sheets of paper, which were also remarks.\nOld Tho said :\"The Lord had read these books in the evening either before he sailed, and forgot to place them with others; but, says how, they must lie there until his return; for he is so special, if I move nothing without order, he would frown the line for a together week; he is otherwise very good. I once made a service bim; and I booed the product of this farm for the trouble of taking care of him, except for twenty zeophines which I pay to an old Armerii who resides in a small collage in the wood, arid which the lord brought here from Adrianoplc; I do not know for which son read .\"\nThe crowding of the house outside was pleasant. The front porch walls fifty steps long and fourteen wide, and the marble pillars canned with black plinths and fret work cornices (as it is now usual in Greek architecture ), were considerably higher than the roof. The roof, surrounded by a blanket of light stone, walls covered with a fine turcoy carpet, under an awning of strong coarse linen. Most of the roofs of the house are thus furnished, as on them, the Greeks pass their evening smoking, drinking light with news, like \"lachryma christi\", catiring fruit, and enjoy the evening breeze.\nOn the left, as we had done, a small streetlet glissa, grapes, orariges and lime were alongside each other on its edges, and under the bank of two bushes of myrtle largo, a marble seat with an ommental wooden back placed, on which we were told, the lord spent many of his evenings and nights until twelve o'clock, reading, writing, arid speaking to himself. \"I suppose ,\" said the old man, praying, because he was very fervent, and gliding our church twice a week, in addition to Sundays.\nTobe seen from this seat was what could be shut down \"a bird-eye view\". A line of rich vineyards led the eye to Mount Calcla, covered with olive trees and blueberries in bloom, set on the ummil whose ancient Greek temple appeared in majestic decomposition. A small stream squiring from the ruins described in broken waterfalls, until it is lost in the roads near the base of the mountain. The sea smooth as glass, and a horizon not overshadowed by a single cloud, Finishes the view in front; and a butterfly on the left, through a view of noble hazelnuts and palm trees, several small islands were observed distinctly, studying the light blue wave with spots of emerald green. I rarely enjoyed a videomore than I did; but our cquiries were without results as to the name of the person who misresided in this kingly solitude: no one has kriew his name, but Dominick, his banker, who had gone to Canada. \"The Armenian\" said our conductor ,\"could say so, but I sure he could riot ,\"and can you say it, old money ?\" \"If I can ,\" he said ,\" I don't dare .\" We didn't have time to visit the Armenian. We went back to the city. We had several articles in the name of the Lord. He had taken a portion of young girls when he was last on the island, and had a dance with them at the nuptial festival. He gave a cow to a man, horses to others, and cotton and silk to the girls who live by weaving these items. He also bought a new boat for a fisherman who had lost his own in a storm, and he often gave Greek Testaments to the poor children. In short, it seemed to us, from all that we had gathered, to have been a very eocentric and benevolent character. A circumstance that we have learned that our old friend at home talent is capable of not revealing. He had a daughter of the most beautiful, whom he often saw walking on the shore, and he had bought him a piano-strong, and he himself taught him how to use it.\nThis was the information with which that we separated from the peaceful island of Mitylene; our imaginations all on the rack, guessing who this crawler in Greee could be. Hc child money it was obvious: he held disposition, philanthropy, and all these eccentricities that mark a particular genius. When we arrived at Palermo, our doubts were dispelled. Falling in a company with M. FOSTER, the architect, a student of WYATTLES, who had been on a trip to Egypt and Greece ,\" The individual, he says, on whom you are anxious, is Lord Byron; I met them on my trips to the island of Tenedos, and I also visited it in Mitylene .\" We had never heard of the fame of his secretary, as we had been at the storm house for a few years; but \"Childe Horolde\" being put in our hands, we recognized the reclus of Calcla in each place. Have we not regretted that we have not been more curious in our research at the cottage, but we have comforted our resolves with the idea of returning to Mityline on a future day; but to be reborn that day will never return. I make this statement, believing that she is not entirely uninteresting, and in justice in the right name of her secretary, who has her grossly slandered. He has been described....\nreads as an insensitive disposition, inverse to association with human nature, or contributing in any way to appease his sorrows, or strange to his pleasures. The fact is direct in the opposite, as can be clearly gathered from these little anecdotes. All the finer feelings of the heart, so elegantly unfolded in the secondary poems, seem to have their seat in his room. Tenderncss, syinpatby, and charity seem to guide all his actions; and his courting of the reboso of solitude is an additional reason to mark him as a being ng on whose heart, religion put his merI, and on whose head Benevolerice half threw his coat. No man can read the previous pleasant \"features\" without feeling proud of him as a counselryman. With respect to his rents or his pleasures, I do not assume the right to give an fair opinion. Reports must always be received with caution, especially when they are directed against the moral integrity of a man; and whoever dares to justify himself before a horrible court where all must appear, only can censor the mistakes of a concert. Lord Byron's character is the worthy of his genius. Doing good in secret, and rejecting the applause of the world, is the surest question of a virtue and self-approving consciousness.\nTHE END!\nGillet, Prince, Crown Court, Fleet-Sleet."
